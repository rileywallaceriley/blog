If you're doing the math that's 20 years. the album hit certified gold, which would go on to be the highest selling album of his career. 20 years later, Murray is touring to celebrate 20 years in the game.\n<!--more-->\nMurray, whose hip-hop legacy includes a classic battle with <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-hxOPZGedU\">Big Daddy Kane</a>, first gained notoriety when he appeared on Erick Sermon's solo debut album on the track <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SUDm0BvCGo\"><em>Hostile</em></a>. As 1/3 of the newly dubbed \"Def Squad\" – that also included Redman – he signed with Jive and went on to release his classic solo album. It was well received (reaching #5 on the US R&B Charts) and made Murray a star. Murray released four subsequent solo projects, a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdjhwjjDcSU&list=PLRBu2o2gHu19XQIN6EAhAi6DzfpJbd8qj\">Def Squad</a> album and a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znoedotrfF4\">collaboration project with Canibus</a> – he also worked with an A-list of hip-hop royalty along the way.\n\nRecently, Murray was slated to <a href=\"http://www.hiphopdx.com/index/news/id.30868/title.keith-murray-fredro-starr-battle-cancellation-detailed\">battle 1/3 of the classic group ONYX</a>, Fredro Starr, in Atlanta Georgia.

    "content_html": "In 1993, the Wu-Tang Clan released, what many would consider to be, one of the greatest albums in hip-hop history. <em><a href=\"https://www.google.ca/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=2&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0CCgQtwIwAQ&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3D5sW2vI5Rmw8&ei=uhdBVLHaOqPnsASUvIGQDQ&usg=AFQjCNGd_L0eMRLlElI9sjq04gViBC0nUg&sig2=q_kbdFvVc95SzxY6sLzTUA&bvm=bv.77648437,d.cWc\">Enter The Wu-Tang: 36 Chambers</a></em> made superstars out of the nine member squad from Shaolin as well as changed the face of the music game – from a behind the scenes <em>business</em> standpoint. Their subsequent releases, such as <em><em>Wu-Tang Forever</em></em>, only solidified their legacy as did the massive catalogue that includes solo spin-offs, affiliates and so on.\n\n<!--more-->\n\nBut that was then, this is now. The question that is on everyone's mind – in a digital age where trap and pop reign supreme – is whether Wu-Tang Clan can still be both relevant <em>and</em> fresh. Whether a new generation will ever truly appreciate the magic that the first album cast on the golden era remains to be seen, but for their core audience that have grown with them, the rumors of a new album have only excited us; however talks of <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oO6nyglMDHY\">in-fighting</a> and issues surrounding money had seemingly derailed reunion plans.\n\nThat was until RZA announced what every fan wanted to hear – the project was on. To top it off, he dropped on us what could possibly be the most brilliant marketing strategy ever. A <a href=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2014/05/for-5-million-one-person-will-get-to-own-the-only-copy-of-the-new-wu-tang-album/371020/\">one-off album</a> that would be auctioned off to the highest bidder. The rest of us would have to settle for special guarded listening sessions during a proposed museum tour. This creates an almost \"holy grail\" effect, especially since RZA himself proclaimed this to be probably the best material you've heard from the clan since their classic debut. Hard to argue with this <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/zackomalleygreenburg/2014/05/06/unlocking-the-wu-tang-clans-secret-album-in-morocco/\">51 second snippet</a>.\n\nThis new concept, as RZA puts it places <em>value on the music as though it were a piece of art</em>. This is something that the music industry is sorely lacking. Could this bold new direction save hip-hop (assuming you feel it needs saving)? At the very least it will surely pressure artists to be more creative with they marketing strategies.\n\nSeeing as how I don't have 5 million laying around, I'll have to line up for a copy of A<em> Better Tomorrow</em> – the clan's upcoming public release – when it drops. Clan in the front!\n\n<iframe src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/BFMmVEs5dmA\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe>",

    "content_html": "“Golden era” of hip-hop — not rap — can be defined (as an era) by three distinct things: scratch hooks, anthems and albums. In an era where the DJ was seen as equal group member with the emcee, labels really took chances and spent the money to ensure entire projects were successful. Sometimes they were and sometimes, in hindsight, they’ve provided more long-term intrinsic value within the building blocks of our culture than monetary value to the labels. Any hip-hop head will tell you though, it’s about the anthems. The timeless joints that bring you back to that era. The songs that seem just as fresh and relevant today as they did the first time you heard them — think <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6xGuGSDsDrM\" target=\"_blank\">OPP</a>, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JZom_gVfuw\" target=\"_blank\">Juicy</a>, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kk0pCbTtPv0\" target=\"_blank\">One Love</a> and <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9lNbNGbo24\" target=\"_blank\">Mass Appeal</a>. You know the joints any hip-hop DJ can drop today, in some cases 20 years after the fact, and get the same reaction.\n<p class=\"p2\"><!--more--></p>\n<p class=\"p2\">It’s impossible to deny that from the first scratch of “when the east is in the house…oh my god, god, god…” you’re open. That’s the legacy that MC Outloud and DJ PF Cuttin’ have. One of the most recognizable joints from the era, and a piece of a puzzle that went by the name “<a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/blah-blah-blah/id289652832?uo=4\" target=\"itunes_store\"><em>Blah Blah Blah</em></a>”, which was the sole full length release from the group Blahzay Blahzay. PF Cuttin produced the entire project. In fact over the years he’s produced for numerous hip-hop artists like <a href=\"http://www.hiphopdx.com/index/singles/id.18944/title.pf-cuttin-f-action-bronson-bronsonmania-prod-pf-cuttin\" target=\"_blank\">Action Bronson</a> (<a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/bronsonmania-deluxe-feat./id500826089?uo=4\" target=\"_blank\">buy</a>) and <a href=\"https://www.google.ca/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&cad=rja&ved=0CCkQtwIwAA&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DhdX1JaTHa5Y&ei=RXnNUq_CPMezqQH4iYC4Ag&usg=AFQjCNGzn4mwy3MX6G83pN-79wOAUypmKQ&bvm=bv.59026428,d.aWM\" target=\"_blank\">Labba</a>. He’s released 100+ mixtapes since 1994, and has DJ’d all over the world.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">Recently I was lucky enough to interview DJ PF Cuttin, who recounted the creation of the classic hip-hop staple Danger, details why they never released a follow up (as Blahzay Blahzay) and talks NY hip hop.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">Oh my god…god…god…</p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><strong>You put in a lot of work prior to ‘95, can you give us some of your background? Who have you produced for?</strong></p>\n<p class=\"p2\">Prior to 95, I had played drums on a record for an artist that was signed to Bodyrock, a sub-label of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tommy_Boy_Entertainment\" target=\"_blank\">Tommy Boy</a>, named Mc Watchout.  He was a friend of mine, so he asked me to play live drums while he rapped on it — it (the song) was called <em><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOSqDyDu9h4\" target=\"_blank\">Drop the Bass</a></em>, which was a b-side to his <a href=\"http://rateyourmusic.com/artist/mc_watchout_and_dj_oz\" target=\"_blank\">single</a>. I also programmed drums for an Mc Shan single called <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VghpK4BHp64\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Time For Us To Defend Ourselves</em></a>. Of course, I was also working on music with Mc Outloud (BLAHZAY).</p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><strong>How did you first link up with Outloud? </strong></p>\n<p class=\"p2\">We were (and still are) friends. Since childhood. You know: wiffleball, two-hand touch, skelly and hiphop.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><strong>Do you remember the session when you guys recorded “Danger”? Do you remember banging the beat out? Did you know the song would become such a big deal?</strong></p>\nYep, sure do. The original Danger, and mostly all our music, was recorded in <a href=\"http://billdonnelly.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Laughing Dog Studios</a> on Staten Island – shout out my dude Bill, a longtime friend and engineer – this was our home for recording,(88-94). We would drive up there  almost every weekend, pay the verazano toll which was $5 (now $15) and just lay ideas down to two-inch reel. I remember us working on our demo to shop to labels and I had this one track, Outloud had the lyrics and I already had the scratch idea. Once the song was done, after a second listen, I wasn’t content with the music I  created, so I went back to the lab with a mix of the song with just the scratch chorus, lyrics and beat (but no music) so I could change the main sample but keep everything the same. The minute I hit the pad on my drum machine with my <a href=\"http://youtu.be/SLaJIspZwjQ?t=2m13s\" target=\"_blank\">new idea</a>, and mixed it with what I had on cassette tape, I felt/heard the dopeness coming out of my speakers. I immediately called Outloud played it over the phone, then called Bill and booked time so I could lay down what I had. The rest was history.\n<p class=\"p2\">I kind of knew and felt in my soul that this track was better than anything I ever heard or created.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><strong>What was your favorite song on the album, and why?</strong></p>\n<p class=\"p2\">I loved every song on that album, we put our heart and soul in creating that album. It was a vision we had as teenagers that manifested itself in front of our eyes. It was a lot of work, very little luck involved, countless hours of recording and sharping our skills and being in love with hip hop. All this combined created that album.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><strong><img class=\"alignleft\" src=\"http://muzikosvirtuve.lt/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/Blahzay_Blahzay.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"267\" height=\"262\" />Do you have any standout hip-hop moments from your career thus far? Like meeting an idol, etc.</strong></p>\n<p class=\"p2\">To be honest, not really. We weren’t star stuck as youngsters. I ran around with <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jrhK58Dypio\" target=\"_blank\">Daddy-O</a> of Stetsasonic, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professor_X_the_Overseer\" target=\"_blank\">Professor X</a> of the X Clan, who was a friend of mine at an early age and <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvYIpa1Ulvw\" target=\"_blank\">Positive K</a>. Always around hip hop legends or soon to be legends. Outloud hung out with Biggie, Mr Cee, Craig G and tons of others. We had these type of friends before the record deal.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><strong>Why did you guys not release an official follow-up? </strong></p>\n<p class=\"p2\">We signed for three albums and  delivered one. After we did the <em>Blah Blah Blah</em> album run, we were being forced to sign with Violator Management, but we wanted our friends to earn their keep and manage us. It turned out that who ever was signed to Violator was going over to Universal, so if you didn’t sign you was lost in the mix.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">Eventually Fader Mercury would be no more. Once we lost our home, it was very difficult to land a new deal, we had material ready, but no major backing or distribution. We later put out the FRN’Z ep with <a href=\"http://betteronvinylblog.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Game records</a> which were songs for our 2nd album.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><strong>NYC hip-hop has undergone a lot of changes, and seems to be heavily influenced by other regions. EVERYONE seems to have opinions on this. As someone who was so influential during a pivotal time in hip-hop history. What is your take on the East Coast scene?</strong></p>\n<p class=\"p2\">I think the east coast scene is still strong and there’s a lot of good, dope, original hip hop out there. Except now it doesn’t’ get any major radio play. On the radio all you hear is stripper music all day.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><strong>What are you currently playing?</strong></p>\n<p class=\"p2\">I have a Ustream radio show called East New York Radio. It comes on every tues. 8-10pm and thur. 10pm-12am, co-hosted by Sean Price and DJ Millz Murda. On the show I play everything that’s current eastcoast or sounds like 90’s hiphop. No trip or trap music on here. I’ve had (as guests) and played artists like Sean P, Maffew Ragazino, Roc Marciano, Action Bronson, Meyhem Lauren, AG the Coroner, Troy Ave, Bodega Bamz, Spit Gemz, Starvin B, Beatnuts, Tony Touch, Guilty  Simpson, Blackmilk, Timeless Truth, Labba, Masta Killa, Raekwon, Ghostface, Wu-Tang, Agallah, JLove, Outdoorsman, Statik Selectah, Marco Polo, DJ Skizz, Scram Jones, Brown 13 … anything that resembles what I grew up on and is current, gets played. Here’s the <a href=\"http://www.ustream.tv/channel/pf-cuttin-s-eastnyradio%20target=_blank\" target=\"_blank\">link to the show</a>, and my <a href=\"http://www.pfcuttin.com/\" target=\"_blank\">website</a>.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><strong>What advice do you have for up and coming producers?</strong></p>\n<p class=\"p2\">Stay true to the game, do your homework, know the history of this music. Don’t be afraid to sample, that’s what made hip-hop what it is. Follow your dreams, invest in yourself, practice, stay humble and love your family.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><strong>Tell us about PF in 2014. What do you do? Where can people find you?</strong></p>\n<p class=\"p2\">In 2014 you can catch me live, when I’m not on tour, every Tuesday 8-10 & Thurs 10 -12 on EastNYRadio <a href=\"http://www.ustream.tv/channel/pf-cuttin-s-eastnyradio\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.ustream.tv/channel/pf-cuttin-s-eastnyradio</a>.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">I’m still DJ’ing clubs and bar lounges around the universe, spinning for Sean Price. I’m also running my studio as a master engineer and STILL producing those bangers. I got a dope website were you can listen to me live, download a shit load of my music for free and/or purchase some of my new stuff, PFCUTTIN.com.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">I got projects I’m working on with Sean Price, Labba, Masta Killa, Blahzay and, as well, my new album. I’m also breaking some new artists. You need to reach me, hit me on twitter @pfcuttin, and facebook pfcuttin. Love is love, thank you.</p>\n\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/0YuvpHA7Wg4\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>",

    "content_html": "Commercialization of hip-hop culture during the 90s had more than one negative effect on the way we consume music. The obvious, which I’ll begin this piece by delving into, is the dictation of what we should be listening to. It’s simple really: labels spend (a lot) of money marketing the spit out of products (artists) they have huge stake in – basic business. It becomes a pay to play scenario. This model ensured that groups in the 90s that didn’t conform to a specific “emerging style/sound” had the impossible task of getting the spins and awareness necessary to generate into the big dollars. In fact many great artists and projects were shelved (think Cormega). What I mean is, cheesy cats like Hammer and Vanilla Ice (who were poster children for “rap” aka Macklemores of the day) enjoyed perks, like over the top marketing budgets, that groups like <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2H3suBgxc2M\">KMD</a>, for example, didn’t.\n\n<!--more-->\n\nEnter Organized Konfusion – the duo of Prince Po and Pharaoh Monch – whose debut was hailed by Allmusic as “the underground hip-hop album of the 90s”. With 3 critically acclaimed albums, they never really had the proper label – nor radio – marketing support necessary to reach the masses. But they had things money could never buy: skills, authenticity and soul. Not once in any of their (three) albums, which were largely self produced and featured little to no features or filler, did they compromise their sound, or integrity as artists. In 1997, without egos or animosity, the duo decided to walk away from OK and peruse solo endeavors; although, many newer (post 1998), hip-hop “fans” are likely more familiar with the solo work of Pharaoh, largely due the massive success of his single Simon Says. Some who were in the know (about OK) thought that Prince Poetic fell off the face of the earth. Totally false!\n\nPrince Po never fell off, fact! He released his first solo project, <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6547-the-slickness/\">The Slickness</a>, in 2004 to rave reviews. He followed with two more solo releases (amidst many memorable features in the downtime), working with notable producers/artists such as Large Pro, J-Live, MF-Doom, Danger Mouse, Madlib and TOMC3 (who produced his entire 3rd release) to name a few.\n\nFor the past few years, Po has been working with Stones Throw producer/artist Oh No – who happens to be the younger brother of producer Madlib. What began as informal collaboration has led up to <a href=\"http://ughh.com/prince-po-animal-serum/GRES753CD/\">Animal Serum</a>, their new project dropping <a href=\"http://ughh.com/prince-po-animal-serum/GRES753CD/\">February 4th</a>. I recently spoke with Po about his career, the project and his thoughts on hip-hop.\n\nInterview below.\n\n<strong>How did you get into hip-hop? How did you meet Pharaoh?</strong>\n\nMusic was always around me as a child. My sister was always playing funk, and we grew up in the church around gospel music. It’s always been a part of my life.\n\nPharoah and I grew up the in the same Neighbourhood (Southside Jamaica Queens). We were always familiar with each other, as we went to the same elementary and middle schools. When we got older we got more aquatinted, playing ball and stuff like that. Hip hop was just around us (the neighbourhood), there were local DJ’s who would come outside and play – progression into that was just natural. Originally he (Pharoah) was a beat boxer and I was the MC. Cats used to call him Mailbox. We used to make tapes, but we were having trouble filling them, so I told him he had to start writing rhymes to help me fill them up. The first rhyme he wrote was off the chain, he was a natural. From that point on we were a duo.\n\n<strong>How did you come up with the name Organized Konfusion?</strong>\n\nOriginally we were called Simply 2 Positive. At that time, names with numbers were popular, and we were younger so we ran with it. As we got more serious we realized it needed to change (the name). We wanted something that was more general, and wasn’t attached with a niche. We didn’t want to be pigeon-holed if we experimented with different types/styles of music (like rock collabos, etc.) or different topics in our rhymes. We wanted to be able to tell different types of stories and express many different emotions. We needed a name that would really stand the test of time. We finally settled on Organized Konfusion, which is an oxymoron. When looking at the way we were going about things and living, it was definitely a fitting name.\n\n<strong>Talk a little bit about your creative process.</strong>\n\nWe just listened to what the music told us. Me an Monch would usually get together early in the morning have breakfast, brainstorm, smoke something, brainstorm more , play games — regular human shit. Then when were ready we made music. We just always wanted to make music that was adhesive, I mean, we’re from an era where you had to be original, and you couldn’t sound like the next man…you needed to stay ahead of the game. It was all about making (new) contributions to a good cause, to a powerful culture — Hip-hop is a lifestyle, it’s more than music. It’s a connection between people worldwide.\n\n<strong>How did you make the decision to go solo?</strong>\n\nWe were stuck in between a rock and a hard place. On one hand we had people telling us “oh you guys don’t have the right promotion”, and on the other we had cats who would reference us as influential figures. Being rappers rapper is a good feeling — but, we didn’t have a niche. It’s hard for executives to really properly push artists without niches. We wanted to preserve our name and just put it on hold. Wait for a day when maybe we can work (as OK) with someone who really knows what they’re doing. There were no hard feelings at all. We went hard, we toured, did every interview we could. We made money.\n\nPharoahe expressed interest in trying a solo effort, and as for myself, I was really starting to transition my production to the digital era (pro tools, fruity loops). The game was changing and I really wanted to make sure that I was changing with it. This goes back to our mantra of staying ahead of the game. So I really went back to school with everything. I used to read the blogs and thought it was so funny how cats thought I fell off, or was smoked out and things like that – all the while, I’m in an apartment with my rent paid for 6 months making beats.\n\n<strong>Talk a bit about your latest project Animal Serum with OH NO. How did you guys link up?</strong>\n\nWe’ve been cool for years. I met Oh (and Madlib) years ago through different situations. Oh’s an exceptionally talented dude, very passionate and humble, who has music in his DNA. I could tell that we (Organized Konfusion) had an influence on them, but they (LootPack) had an influence on us. We’re both very rough edged cats, and the connection really just fell into place. We worked together and separate on this record — I went out there and we also sent stuff from studio to studio.\n\nThe project is just a good musical album. It’s very inspiring and built up of really raw funk and soul. It’s been in the making for years now. We started out more just wanting to make a few songs to see what we could do with them. It ended up becoming an full LP, and I’m really proud of it. It fits the times that we live in. It’s a rollarcoaster (of emotions) that I think touches on really relatable universal experiences. What I really want people to do is be more in tune to themselves, find more peace and more drive to do what they want to do, and get what they want to get. Songs on this album touch on that, and that’s really why I called it Animal Serum, because this is what will restore people back to their raw/strong point.\n\nIn this exclusive audio clip, Po discusses his thoughts on the current eastcoast hip-hop scene, his view on the “king of” discussion and plugs his latest release <em>Animal Serum</em>.\n\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/131680121&color=ff5500\"></iframe>\n\nAnimal Serum, featuring verses from Pharaoh Monch, O.C, Rock (of Heltah Skeltah), Safiir, Sadat X and produced entirely by Oh No is available <a href=\"http://ughh.com/prince-po-animal-serum/GRES753CD/\">now</a>.

    "content_html": "It runs in the family.\n\nIt’s often (but not always) surprising when you realize that artists are the products of either musical parents and/or have talent in their families. This was true for artists like Prodigy of Mobb Deep, whose grandfather, Budd Johnson and great-uncle Keg Johnson were active in the Bebop era of jazz. His mother, Fatima Frances Collins, was also a member of the The Crystals, a group that cracked the Us Top 20 charts in the 60’s – side note, read his book. Then there’s Nas, whose father is jazz/blues musician Oli Dara. This is also the case with talented producer/artist Oh No – who happens to be both the son of a musician and the younger sibling of Madvillain producer Madlib aka Quasimoto.\n\n<!--more-->\n\nHe began his career as a rapper, even featuring on wax with his brother’s group Lootpack, but he insists that he, much like his big bro, is a producer first. Hard to disagree when you look/listen to his vast catalogue of releases and credits – from solo releases, his album with Chino XL and Roc C to his group Gangrene (with producer Alchemist).\n\nFrom working with the late great J.Dilla to scoring the fastest – and highest – selling video game of all time, Oh No has had quite the career up to this point. With his latest project Animal Serum (a collaboration with Prince Po) dropping February 4th, I was lucky enough to chat with the cali-based super producer. We touched on everything from his music, his love of video games and gambling at <a href=\"https://casinoenligne-francais.net/lucky31/\">https://casinoenligne-francais.net/lucky31/</a> - to getting beat tapes from Dilla, can you even imagine?\n\nInterview below:\n\n<strong>Did you always know you wanted to be in hip-hop?</strong> I always knew I wanted to do music. From the start, when my parents brought equipment in the house, I was all on it. My mother use to have this keyboard, and she used to write music. My father (Otis Jackson) and brother (MadLib)….man, it’s in my blood. Even my kids read and write music.\n\n<strong>You’ve been in both rapper and producer roles in your career. Which do you prefer?</strong>\n\nI prefer being the producer first, second and third. Being the rapper comes like ninth. I like rapping, don’t get me wrong, but when it comes to shows and all the production I do…all the smoke I’m smoking… It’s too hard to try to remember lyrics. I have to sit there and listen to the songs over and over to get it right. I work on a lot of projects all the time, I’m working on multiple albums each month. So I just don’t have the time to really remember each lyric.\n\n<strong>How did you get into the game?</strong>\n\nI first started with my man J Duce . I was using my brother’s SP12 making beats, and we started our group called Kali Wild. We incorporated Cornbread from the bay and sauna aka Biggs. We made a gang of albums. going back and forth from the ox to oakland trying to get our music on my man recordings..\n\nFrom there I ended up connecting with <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rasco\">Rasco</a>, he was on <a href=\"http://www.stonesthrow.com/\">Stones Throw</a> at the time. He bought a single that we (Biggs and I) did. He showed it to Peanut Butter Wolf, and that’s how I ended up getting my deal.\n\n<strong>Tell me about your love for video games.</strong>\n\nIve always been a crazy game collector since Atari to now with PS4 and all that. I’m also really big into PC gaming. I love simulators. I made a custom arcade that has street fighter to digital pinball on it.. Pretty much every game on it.. It’s like a virtual dave and busters over here.\n\n<strong>How did you get into producing music for video games?</strong>\n\nI used to make beats out of video games. I would always get my beats placed and one day my man – who was working with Capcom – approached me and said I should make video game beats (specifically for Street Fighter). I told him I already had a bunch. I sent over something fresh and they loved it. They asked who I wanted to work with on it, and I had just gotten Redman’s contact so I said, “how about Redman?” They made that happen.\n\nThen I started working with Alchemist and he brought Rockstar into the picture. He was working on GTA Chinatown Wars, doing the music for the radio station, so I worked with him on that. I did drum work for Red Dead Redemption: Undead Nightmare. From there Rockstar approached us (Alchemist and I) about working on GTA V and creating and original soundscapes for each scene in the game. The rest is history..\n\n<strong>And that’s the highest selling game ever. As a serious gamer that must feel great, no?</strong>\n\nBeing a big video game collector, its crazy to have that under my belt… definitely a big deal.\n\n<strong>You also score (shows) for Cartoon Network?</strong>\n\nYeah I do. Cartoon Network, Adult Swim, HBO, CBS, Fox. I can say the bulk of my time goes to scoring TV shows, commercials, video games and documentaries. In fact, I just finished working on a documentary with director David Paul Meyer about a great comedian Trevor Noah called <em>You Laugh But It’s True</em>.\n\n<strong>How did you meet Prince Po?</strong>\n\nI met prince Po about 8 years ago while he was working with Madlib doing a song on the <a href=\"http://www.stonesthrow.com/perceep\">Percee P </a>album (<a href=\"http://www.stonesthrow.com/store/album/perceep/perseverance\">Perserverance</a>). I started sending beats and he started calling me and spitting over the phone. It was crazy like where have you been? Let’s work! We were doing songs off and on, just seeing where it took us.\n\nI was juggling Alchemist projects and Prince Po tracks, on top of scoring, so it took a while to really get this finished. But it’s finally coming out. It’s all very next level stuff.\n\n<strong>What does the title Animal Serum mean to you?</strong>\n\nFor me, I feel like it’s animal blood, you know, drinking the blood of an animal. We’re really trying to regenerate that rawness. The way he’s coming at it with the lyrics is so intense. There’s a LOT of true lyricism, and that’s what we’re bringing back. That raw animal essence.\n\n<em>In the exclusive audio clip below, Oh No shares some Dilla memories with me.</em>\n\n<iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/132047443&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true\" width=\"100%\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"no\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe>",

    "content_html": "If you've been following Nas new as of late, you may have noticed he signed a young brother named Bishop Nehru to his <em>Mass Appeal</em> imprint. Bishop, who's name is a direct nod to Tupac's <em>Juice</em> role and former prime minister of India, Jawaharlal Nehru, who worked closely with Gandhi, is indeed a good look for the label. If his recent release is any indication of what's to come, we're in for a revival of that 90's nostalgia.\n\n<!--more-->\n\nHis latest release <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/nehruviandoom/id902590439\">NehruvianDOOM</a> is a collaboration with the often illusion – always dope – <a href=\"http://www.metalfacedoom.com/\">MF DOOM</a>. The 9 tracks gem, which is available on vinyl if you're vinyl head, is a pleasure to listen to. Insightful lyrics, slamming beats and an overall vibe that takes us back. Tracks like <em>Mean The Most</em> and <em>Caskets</em> will have you (figuratively) wearing out your rewind button. MF DOOM's production, we should note, is also top-notch – less of a departure than JJ DOOM may have been for some heads – plus new DOOM bars are ALWAYS coveted.\n\nIt's easy to see what Nas was thinking with this one. Keep your eyes (and ears) on Bishop – we know we will.\n<div class=\"embed-container\"><iframe src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/z6PIL0mTNug\" width=\"300\" height=\"150\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></div>",

This was the case for Benjamin Bronfman (part of the <a href=\"http://teachersband.com/\">Teachers</a> collective), a producer friend of Kanye West, who was contacted by Yeezus and urged to send him some beats for an upcoming project – which culminated as the critically acclaimed <em><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UY982Uo2TPI\">Yeezus</a></em>. Benjamin cooked up a handful of tracks but one of his demos, <a href=\"http://teachers.fm/\"><em>Cruel Cold Winter</em></a>, obviously rubbed Yeezy the right way. It wasn't until Benjamin attended a listening party that he realized that his track had been used – and how Kanye had evolved (or rather devolved) the sound. Check it out for yourself after the jump.\n<!--more-->\nThe track, which became <em><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-SoKFycTmVU\">New Slaves</a></em>, was for lack of a better description, the \"single\" off the album. It was part of Kanye's <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1zAvT9yHWQ\">innovative and international release strategy</a> – and according to Yeezy himself the tracks second verse was \"the best rap verse of all time\". Personally, I think this demo version is crazy dope, what do you think?\n\n<iframe style=\"border: 0;\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/173481653%3Fsecret_token%3Ds-8DNj6&auto_play=false&auto_advance=false&buying=false&liking=true&download=true&sharing=true&show_artwork=true&show_comments=false&show_playcount=true&show_user=true&start_track=0&callback=true\" width=\"100%\" height=\"100px\"></iframe>\nvia <em><a href=\"http://www.rollingstone.com/music/premieres/exclusive-hear-kanye-wests-original-instrumental-new-slaves-demo-20141027\">Rolling Stone</a></em>",

When people chat about albums that are timeless they always tend to mention album such as <em>Illmatic</em> and <em>Enter The 36 Chambers</em> – but often neglect the gem that was <em><a href=\"http://m.youtube.com/watch?v=Gvp0zucwZ6Q\">Resurrection</a></em>. The sophomore release from Common (who was Common Sense at the time) was a work of art, no other way to describe it.

They blazing track prophetically described the downfall of the golden era of hip-hop – and it still holds up today. It also sparked a <a href=\"http://rapfix.mtv.com/2012/02/13/yo-mtv-raps-common-ice-cube-drake-beef/\">bitter feud with Ice-Cube,</a> which was eventually squashed by Louis Farrakhan.\n\nFrom Resurrection Common, who dropped the \"Sense\" following a legal battle, went nowhere but up.

    "content_html": "1994 was a crazy year in hip-hop. It was the year that Nas dropped his classic, and arguably genre defining, masterpiece <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeGsiub8EA0\"><em>Illmatic</em></a>. Five short months later we were blessed with Biggie Small’s debut <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EVT5ONR0w0\"><em>Ready To Die</em></a>. It was, for all intensive purposes, the height of the golden era – and east coast had that shit on lock. \n\nEnter Kurious (representing uptown), one of the most well known Latino artists on the NYC scene at the time. After getting involved with Bobbito and (Prime Minister) Pete Nice‘s Hoppoh imprint, he released his first single <em><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tmzwEp8cQ4\">Walk Like A Duck</a></em> in 1992. With the duos help he secured himself a deal and released his debut album in ’94 – on Columbia records – <em><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SQL7paLcpQ\">A Constipated Monkey</a></em>, which was released (and promoted) alongside Nas’s <em>Illmatic</em>. With critical acclaim and more than one single, Kurious seemed to be on the rise; however, it wasn’t until 2009 that he released an official follow-up – outside of a handful of memorable collaborations including a verse on MF DOOM’s <em>?</em>.\n<!--more-->\nWe were lucky enough to chat with Kurious himself. In part one of two he discusses his first album, his thoughts on being a pioneer and working with DOOM.\n\nIt’s that <em>uptown</em> shit. Check the interview after the jump\n\n<!--more-->\n\n<strong>How did you first get involved in hip-hop?</strong>\n\nI first got involved with hip hop as a fan when I was 9yrs. old. I grew up on 97th and amsterdam in the height of break dance and graf, across the street from rocksteady park.\n\n<strong>How did you originally get linked up with Bobbitto and Pete Nice?</strong>\n\nI grew up in the same building as Bobbito and he worked at Def Jam and got me a little gig when i finished high school and introduced me to Pete Nice.\n\n<strong>Your first album was a classic…period! It was released on Columbia at the same time as Illmatic (I remember seeing the double ads in the source). Can you talk a bit about this period? On a personal level did you feel any competition with Nas?</strong>\n\nIt was an interesting period and everything was moving fast, I was a kid and very immature but having a lot of fun. I never felt a drop of competition with Nas, me and my friends admired what he was doing and I was just doing what came natural to me. Nas was always cool,really smart and beyond his years.\n\n<strong>What was the process like recording your album? Who did you work with? What was your personal fave cut?</strong>\n\nThat album was a big party. Every session was flooded with homeboys and a lot of intoxicants. I worked with Stimulated Dummies, Beatnuts, Bosco Money and Pete Nice and Richie Rich. I guess my favorite song was I’m Kurious maybe but I really don’t like listening to it (the album) much. I think I was in a  place of mass turmoil but having genuine fun in those days but I wish I was capable of taking things more seriously. I’m glad that some folks consider it a classic though.\n\n<strong>Do you consider it a classic</strong>?\n\nI personally may not consider it classic but it definitely has a charm and that’s not up to me to decide anyway. I am really grateful for how that album affected certain people and I see the sincerity when they approach me.\n\n<strong>Tough question…but many consider you a pioneer or legend. How do you  feel about that? Do consider yourself a pioneer?</strong>\n\nI’m definitely a veteran but my path has been long and unpredictable.  I am a musical artist of some sort that loves hip hop. I think I may be a legend probably in my own mind .\n\n<strong>What kept you from releasing a follow-up until 2009?</strong>\n\nI had to find myself and it took a while. I’m still learning but I was like yo I gotta release an album, it was haunting me.  I had some guest spots here and there and some songs but thats it.   I wasnt believing in myself enough or I was over thinking. You CANT overthink music. You are WAY better off underthinking.\n\n<strong>Tell us what it’s like working with Doom. What is that creative process like?</strong>\n\nWorking with DOOM is great. He is a true artist. Down to earth, unnaffected and loves music but more importantly than that, we were great friends.  The creative process with Doom is a sloppy perfection if you ask me. Smart dude and a kind dude, he’s special. He would make raw beats that always lean the right way and breathe and he always kept a notebook with him. During times when I was uninspired  he would give me a spark. When we get together shit happens and when making hip hop there’s strict rules and theres no rules at the same time. That's how we get down.\n\n<style>.embed-container { position: relative; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; height: auto; } .embed-container iframe, .embed-container object, .embed-container embed { position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; }</style><div class='embed-container'><iframe src='http://www.youtube.com/embed/y89aXhy26k8' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n\n<style>.embed-container { position: relative; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; height: auto; } .embed-container iframe, .embed-container object, .embed-container embed { position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; }</style><div class='embed-container'><iframe src='http://www.youtube.com/embed/mqyGW54gei8' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen></iframe></div>",

Since then she’s dropped, amongst other things,  6+ solo releases. She’s worked with true school royalty in the industry – we’re talking everyone from Styles P to Master Ace (shit she even worked with Lil'B).

This one is different though – the every sharp emcee changes things up and delivers five tracks of singing.

The duo are known for single handedly ushering in the jiggy era, takings Nas to the next level (commercially) and producing some of the most notable records in mainstream hip-hop, such as <em><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JZom_gVfuw\">Juicy</a></em>. The were the driving force behind the supergroup \"The Firm\", they were the first one's to give 50 cent a shot – they produced the bulk of his unreleased <em><a href=\"http://youtu.be/ej00u9qmzLQ\">Power Of The Dollar </a></em>album – and have so many platinum plaques they can barely hang them all up on the wall. But there are a few things they are often not remembered for such as their uncredited production of Biggie's <em><a href=\"http://youtu.be/vJC2ax18oQM\">Who Shot Ya</a></em> and <em><a href=\"http://youtu.be/0Ogs_NsXh58\">One More Chance</a></em> Remix. Or how about the fact that produced both <em><a href=\"http://youtu.be/2o1pnMnNnP0\">Ill Street Blues</a></em> and <em><a href=\"http://youtu.be/VTtrqJWolek\">On The Run</a></em> by Kool G Rap?\n<!--more-->\nMost overlooked though was that Tone, then known as Red Hot Lover Tone was actually a rapper! He dropped not one but two albums on now defunct Select Records. His first album doesn't really hold up, so we'll leave that out of this conversation; although, his second (and final) effort<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLFCNSlyUuCt0WC5K-Ure-1JpL9Li9uGYj\"> <em>#1 Player</em></a> was a gem. Featuring production from the likes of Diamond D and Buckwild (as well as young Trackmasters themselves) and features from LOTNS member Charlie Brown, Big Daddy Kane and Greg Nice. There is one standout track here that make this album a must-listen: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YKwsYNOsAvM&index=7&list=PLFCNSlyUuCt0WC5K-Ure-1JpL9Li9uGYj\">4 My Peeps Remix</a> featuring Organized Konfusion, M.O.P and a young Notorious B.I.G – this is all of these artists in their 1995 form, so you know it's dope. There are two versions of the song, but it' the Buckwild remix that really stands out to us.\n\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/YKwsYNOsAvM?list=PLFCNSlyUuCt0WC5K-Ure-1JpL9Li9uGYj\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\nSo there you have it, another gem to add to your hip-hop bucket list.",

    "content_html": "There's so many ways to get into the game – and it often comes down to who you know. Luckily for Brooklyn (Fort Greene) rapper Divine, he knows venture capitalist Ben Horowitz. After connecting initially on Twitter, the rapper and VC hit it off (because Ben was a huge hip-hop head). Divine, at the time, was <a href=\"https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/divine/ghetto-rhymin-divines-official-debut-hip-hop-rap-a\">trying to fund his debut album</a> <em>Ghetto Rhymin</em> on the popular funding platform Kickstarter. Ben's wife, as well as some of his associates ended up giving generous pledges that led to the projects completion.\n\n<!--more-->\n\nThe album, which we'll off the bat say is very QB in a good way, is a solid 16 song effort. Divine, who sounds like a hybrid of AZ, CNN and Tragedy Khadafi, provides few fillers and features, and instead focuses on bars. He shines on stand-outs like <em>Brooklyn Brooklyn</em>, <em>Gun Talk</em> and <em>Hard Body</em>. The fact that the album sounds like it could have been made 15 years ago (production and rhyme wise) may be a bit off putting for some newer listeners, and may not be for everyone; however, overall it's a great project. All NYC hip-hop – definitely worth a listen.<br /><br />\n\n<iframe src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/ktQj-H9nAXo\" width=\"300\" height=\"315\">\n   width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>",

    "content_html": "The music industry is a weird beast with a shaky temperament. Picture this – you're living out your dream, recording a major label   album. Features are rolling in, money is flowing, ads are printed. It's all in place and a release date is announced; however, that date comes and goes. Days go by, the buzz wears off and fickle fans move on to the next artist in line. This happens, a lot. Here are just a few examples of promising artists or were (extremely) pushed back, and in one case shelved.\n\n<!--more-->\n\n<strong>Charlie Baltimore</strong>\n\nLet's go back in time – Charlie Baltimore was in a great place in the 90's. She was the girl in the <em><a href=\"http://youtu.be/etMpCz8eql8\">Get Money</a></em> video and considered to be Biggie's \"protégé\", she was down with Horse and Carriage Cam'Ron and, shit, she was even rumoured to have been in the ill-fated \"Commission\" with Biggie and Jigga. Things looked up and up. She was in the studio working on her <em><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL8E4AE55C82D00709\">Cold As Ice</a></em> album, that included singles like <em>Stand Up</em> featuring Ghostface Killah and <em>Feel It</em> feat Teddy Riley – not to mention numerous ads/posters. So what went wrong? Creative differences between Baltimore and the record label (Untertainment), and further complications forced the album to be shelved; however it was leaked online. Charli released the album on iTunes herself over a decade later – better late than never.\n\n<iframe src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/fwPgyLGMWLk\" width=\"500\" height=\"315\">\n   width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\n<strong>Young Zee</strong>\n\nNewark New Jersey native, Young Zee, was/is a member of the Outsidaz – a team that boasted members like young Eminem, Rah Digga and Pace Won. Zee seemed primed to be a breakout artist, with a unique style/voice, a single in rotation on BET and The Box and even a feature on the multi-platinum Fugees album The Score. His debut album on Perspective Records, <em><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLqJA2gqwdWJfDaC532p-TMEG8uTz2Y4Ok\">Musical Meltdown</a></em>, featured production by Ski Beatz, KRS-One and Twista with appearances by Lauryn Hill, Busta Rhymes, and KRS-One. So what went wrong? Well, back when the Source had mad integrity – and pretty much ran the magazine game – they gave Young Zee a less-than-glowing review. In fact, that's putting it mildly, they basically tore the album up so bad that the label eventually decided to shelve the project; however, the album is actually ridiculously dope. Tracks like Stay Gold featuring Lauren Hill and Electric Chair feat Pace Won are must listens! \n\n<iframe src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/sQLAThaSjiM\" width=\"500\" height=\"315\">\n   width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\n<strong>Cuban Link</strong>\n\nBig Pun is a legend, no argument. When he started out, he was in a crew called Full Of Clips with partners in rhyme Cuban Link and Triple Seis. Obviously Pun stuck out, but Cuban was his right hand, and was a part of many projects. Being part of the Terror Squad eventually led to a solo project entitled <em><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLEC9AB99ED45C26A2\">24-Karat</a></em>, which featured Pun, Ja Rule and many more heavyweights and close Terror Squad affiliates. Everything was falling into place – and then we were faced with Pun's untimely death. Unfortunately for Cuban, his relationship with Terror Squad capo Fat Joe virtually fell apart without Pun, and so did his deal, leading his album to be indefinitely shelved; although a few singles/videos did surface from the project, including <em>Still Tellin' Lies</em> featuring Tony Sunshine, which actually faired quite well. If you google it out, you can find a copy of the album advance, it's actually a decent listen.\n\n<iframe src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/oBTBYdalIoM\" width=\"500\" height=\"315\">\n   width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>",

    "content_html": "Hip-hop has an incessant need to one-up. Sometimes this becomes frustrating to sit through as it often translates to simply following suit until it becomes overly redundant. A few examples being the <em><a href=\"http://youtu.be/pBXniiEgmMk\">Hot Nigga</a></em> phenomenon that spawned literally a million versions with accompanying videos and <em><a href=\"http://youtu.be/AAbi1494n0M\">Chi-Raq</a></em> that become old fast as rapper after rapper made odes to their set over the Lil'Herb/Nicki Minaj song of the same name. We can also mention the cypher, made popular by BET as a device to boost ratings for the annual award show. That concept spawned an unbelievable amount of cyphers  – filmed in black and white of course.\n\n<!--more-->\n\nEvery once and a while one of these phenomenons have the potential to shake up and excite the game. Remember when Kendrick Lamar slapped every single NYC rapper in the face then proceeded to call out everyone? That type of challenge to \"<em>step up your game</em>\" can sometimes be what the industry needs. Something that keeps fans glued to the internet feverishly waiting for responses from their fave emcees. As of last week, it seems as though we may have our next big thing.\n\nAs part of the Shady XV, Eminem released <em><a href=\"http://youtu.be/vjUgJ6Cw5PU\">Detroit vs Everybody</a></em>, a Detroit anthem featuring Royce The 5'9, Big Sean and Danny Brown. The outro features D-town bully Trick-Trick telling Marshall he's taking the beat to the hood to get that \"fire remix\". The excitement started to build as Snoop Doggy Dogg posted artwork on his Instagram for <em>Los Angeles vs Everybody</em> – a potential answer to the latter.\n\nWhere will this end up? We predict a New York vs Everyone, Chicago vs Everyone, Atlanta vs Everyone – and so on and so on. It's only a matter of time before it gets out of hand, but for the time being, we're excited!  \n\nWhat potential line-ups would you like to see? Note we made that NYC line-up ourselves.\n\n<a href=\"http://aboveaveragehiphop.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/IMG_1186.png\"><img src=\"http://aboveaveragehiphop.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/IMG_1186.png\" alt=\"IMG_1186.PNG\" class=\"alignnone size-full\" /></a>\n\n<a href=\"http://aboveaveragehiphop.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/IMG_1274.jpg\"><img src=\"http://aboveaveragehiphop.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/IMG_1274.jpg\" alt=\"New York vs Everyone\" class=\"alignnone size-full\" /></a><br /><br />",

Another group celebrating 20 years + in the game, the Brownsville, Brooklyn duo MOP, dropped their long awaited new EP <em>Street Certified</em>. At 9 songs, it's a solid effort that has some respectable new street-hop and a few pre-leaked standouts (notably the title track featuring Mobb Deep and addictive <em>187</em>). If you're a fan, you'll love this album. The project has a few guests – Maino joins Billy and Fame on the lead-off <em>Welcome To Brooklyn</em>, and Busta Rhymes on the single <em>Broad Daylight</em>.\n\n<!--more-->\n\nWhat you have to love/respect about MOP is that they know what they are (and what they aren't). They deliver consistent music, and have been doing so since <em>How About Some Hardcore</em>. This project is unlikely to build much of a new fan-base as none of the songs have the massive commercial appeal of a song like <em>Ante Up</em>, but we doubt they care.

She's been heard on major radio and was even recognized by Source Magazine in their coveted Unsigned Hype column. Check out our interview with Ms. Saki Bomb after the jump.\n\n<!--more-->\n\n<strong>What's good? Tell everyone who you are and where you’re from?</strong>\n \nWhats Upppp it’s your girl Saki Bomb bka Young Nik! Im from Fort Greene, Brooklyn, by way of Japan...I'll explain that later.  \n \n<strong>How long have you been in this Hip-Hop game?\n </strong>\nSince 2008 when I dropped my video for \"<em>Bouncers</em>\".\n \n<strong>What was your first exposure to Hip-Hop?</strong>\n \nI would say the Lil Kim/Foxy Brown era hit me the hardest. Biggie, Jay-Z...I'm from Brooklyn so you already know.\n \n<strong>Who has influenced you? </strong>\n \nJames Brown, Lauren Hill, Lil Kim , Foxxy Brown, Queen Latifah, Biggie, Jay-Z, Limp Bizkit, Linkin' Park and my family, because my cousin wrote my first rap. We would have the karaoke machine going and dubbing tapes. Damn! Fun times!\n \n<strong>Define your style?</strong>\n \nI call it “Hipclectic” because I sound like everything in one; Hip-Hop, R&B and Pop. \nIt can be so diverse. I had to make up a new genre.\n \n<strong>What challenges do you face being a female MC?  </strong>\n \nI would say breaking away from stereotypes that plague female Hip-Hop artists. For example, females that slept their way to the top versus females with actual talent, grinding for their own respect for their craft. Also companies thinking females are too emotional. I mean, I am emotional, but I put it in my music not my business. I’m worth the risk! \n \n<strong>Being from NYC, do you feel the road is even more difficult as opposed to other Femcees from other regions?  </strong>\n \nOf course, Hip-Hop originated from NYC so they set higher standards in this part of town. Not that I can't reach, but it’s easier for people from other places to be easily accepted, just by saying they're different (without necessarily being good). I like competition though. I usually feel I have none because I do me. I don't follow others. I create trends, I don't follow them. \n \n<strong>Where are some places you've performed at?</strong> \n \nAramachi Lounge, SOB's, Times Square (100,000 people outside), Speed, 5Spot, Boston Concert Venue, Philly, Rose Castle…so many places. \n \n<strong>What are your Top 3 Hip-Hop albums of all time?</strong>\n \n<em>Reasonable Doubt</em>, <em>Miseducation of Lauren Hill</em> and (Lil' Kim's) <em>Hardcore</em>. Oh and Foxy Brown's <em>Broken Silence</em>... I couldn't pIck just 3! \n \n<strong>What are your most memorable accomplishments to date? </strong>\n \nUnsigned Hype in Source Magazine, Independent Artist in Source Magazine, Future Female in Straight Stuntin' Magazine, my jingle playing on Ms. Jones morning show on Hot 97 for a year straight and winning the ILLMIND rhyme challenge in Brooklyn (Trophy). \n \n<strong>What advice would you give to young Femcees? </strong>\n \nStay true to yourself and do music that makes you feel good. This game isn't for the faint of heart. You have to be strong and always continue leaning. You have to be able to handle people's opinions. But, always stay open minded.   \n \n<strong>What can we be expect from Young Nik going into 2015? </strong>\n \nYou can expect Young Nik to be Saki Bomb!   \n\n<iframe src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/62lsDJG4Gvg\" width=\"500\" height=\"315\">\nwidth=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\n\n\n<br /><br />",

    "content_html": "Let's be honest, Eminem is one of the best rap artists out there – he can rap circles around you. If he's not on your list of best artists you're just being a hater; although he can come off kind of <em>hocky</em> at times, he pretty much earns a pass. His latest release <em>Shady XV</em> is a compilation that showcases his re-energized Shady Records. It's a good look for hip-hop, and we'll explain why in a minute. Let's talk about the tracks.\n\n<!--more-->\n\nThe album starts off with a barrage of bars from Slim himself on the self-produced title track, which sets the tone. Stand-outs from there include <em>Vegas</em> (by Bad Meets Evil), which features the overhyped Iggy Azalea rape jokes (ha?), Slaughterhouse's <em>Y'all Know Me</em> produced by Primo and the Just Blaze/Boy 1da produced <em>Psychopathic Killer</em>. Em's self-produced <em>Right For Me</em> and <em>Fine Line</em> are also good listens. In all the project features Kobe, Slaughterhouse, Yelawolf, Skylar Gray and anyone from the D that matters.\n\nNow why is this album a good look for hip-hop? It's cover to cover bars. It seems like good old fashioned skills are slowly taking the main stage again in hip-hop – and like any \"corporation\" it needs to start from the top down. Instead of signing gimmicky \"hype\" artists, Em seems to be rolling with spitters (like them or not). D12 kind of gets a pass, but everyone else here has bars.\n\nThe album closes with the Static Selektah produced Detroit vs Everyone, which (again) we predict will be a thing once other cities drop replies. Disc 2 is all old joints, we skipped that.\n\nIt's now out everywhere – <a href=\"http://www.melodyspot.com/albums/view/422/Eminem-_Shady-XV\">stream it here</a>.\n\n\n<iframe src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/LbftYWk9Bn0\" width=\"500\" height=\"315\">\nwidth=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>",

The two, who have collaborated extensively in the past have pulled together 11 piff-laced soundscapes that are sure to please both Mobb and Boogetz fan.\n<!--more-->\nStandouts are the ultra smooth trip down memory lane, <em>40oz</em>, the soulful (love) song <em>Pass Me</em> and the Mobb Deepish <em>Scarface</em>. P sounds like he hasn't missed a step 20 years later, which is a good look for Boogz.\n\nWhat should be noted is that Boogz and P are very levelled on this project – that is to say that neither is ever overshadowed [something that could happen when making a joint project with a seasoned vet like P]; however, this isn't the first time Boogz has spit with big-time artists. His 2010 DJ Khaled hosted debut had names like Ace Hood and Wiz Khalifa on it. \n\nBut the way we see it, collaborative projects are a tricky beast that either work or don't. Red and Meth, Skyzoo and Torae...sheesh even Snoop and Wiz are joint ventures that make so much sense you wish you'd thought of it first. P and Boogz fit well together, and <em>Young Rollin' Stoners</em> proves it.\n\naahiphop approved!

What's more, (contractually) 80% of the proceeds went directly to fight AIDS.\n\nThe album, whose title itself is an acronym for AIDS, is an atmospheric mid-90's hip-hop ride that definitely deserves a few (re)spins.

    "content_html": "If you've been following the kid Boogz Boogetz, you'll know that his latest project, a collaborative album with Prodigy (of Mobb Deep), is far from his intro to the rap world – hell it's not even his first time working with Prodigy. The Far Rockaway rapper has been making some real noise since the 2010 release of his DJ Khaled and DJ Ill Will hosted mixtape <em>Far Rockaway's Most Wanted</em>. As he prepares the release of his upcoming <em>Cool 2 </em> and inevitable tour for <em>Young Rollin Stonerz</em>, Boogz took a few minutes out to chat with AAHIPHOP. Peep the interview after the jump!\n\n<!--more-->\n\n<strong>How did you get into hip-hop?\n</strong>\nWell, I got into the it watching my older brother (Un Pacino) who was doing his rap thing, so being around him in the studio, and being in school battling people. That's what molded me. I was always into rapping, but it wasn't until I started to get exposed to big names in the studio with my brother – like Prodigy and Juelz Santana – that I actually began to take it seriously.\n\n<strong>How did you connect with P initially?</strong>\n\nWell, as I mentioned, my brother Un worked with Prodigy [editor note: he was a close affiliate of the Infamous Mobb]. He released an album with him a few years ago (<em><a href=\"https://m.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLF5C469A7EE3E93A4\">Product Of The 80's</a></em>). So I was always around the studio during that time. Prodigy took a liking to me – I was a skateboarder, and he could see that I had a certain swag about me. He could see I wasn't like all these other dudes spitting. I had bars. So he started rapping with me. We’ve been collaborating ever since.\n\n<strong>Let's talk about this latest project \"<em>Young Rollin' Stonerz</em>\" – what was the process of putting this album together?</strong>\n\nWe wanted to make a record that listeners could ride out to. Something to uplift. We wanted it to be an extremely laid back vibe – you know smoke a blunt, drink some champagne and zone out to the music. Classy, classic music.\n\n<strong>What was the recording process?</strong>\n\nAll the records we did, we did in the studio together. We would just go through beats – he'd bring beats to the table, and I'd bring some to the table. From there we'd just lay down tracks.\n\n<strong>Do you guys have lots of stash tracks?</strong>\n\nYeah, we got a lot of stash tracks [laughs].\n\n<strong>Well, the album is dope...</strong>\n\nWhat was your fave track?\n\n<strong>Personally? I like <em>Pass Me</em>.</strong>\n\nThat track almost didn't make it on the album. Prodigy wasn't feeling it that much; he didn't like the hook I'd done. He wanted to keep a street feel and thought the song was a little outside of the vibe he was going for. I liked it – it has a commercial sound. It sounds like a song about a girl, but it's a song about life. P eventually agreed and let me put it on there.\n\n<strong>Did you guys have any other disagreements about what songs to include?</strong>\n\nWe had a few, but that's only natural. We both want the best product possible.\n\n<strong>I also really love <em>40oz</em>.</strong>\n\nOh, <em>40oz</em> is joint! [laughs] That joint was originally supposed to be me and Chinx Drugz, but we ended up using it for this project\n\n<strong>Are you guys going to tour the album at all?</strong>\n\nWe're currently doing one now – it's the Infamous tour, though. We're supposed to have our tour around January I think\n\n<strong>Do you have any other projects out right now?</strong>\n\nYeah, my latests projects <em><a href=\"http://www.datpiff.com/Boogz-Boogetz-COOL-Creating-Our-Own-Lane-mixtape.380336.html\">Cool</a></em> and <em><a href=\"http://www.datpiff.com/Boogz-Boogetz-American-Fly-mixtape.510335.html\">American Fly</a></em> are available now, and I have <em>Cool 2</em> coming soon – that project has names like Fat Trel, Smoke Dza and Vado on it (to name a few).\n\n<strong>Any last words? </strong>\n\nLook out for the whole YR roster, look out for the entire Infamous Records, shout out my homie Swag and my crew up in Canada. The entire gang man, we here – zoning!\n\n<iframe src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/YScrPA9Pf3E?list=UUOWL-9PGp6sidU0Ik0RDBYA\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe>\n\n<iframe src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/Gz4qZkwjSJw\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe>",

Over Audible Doctors production the rambunctious Onyx frontman delivers a smooth, mellow flow as he reps the Lo-Life lifestyle. The single, <em>Polo Wars</em>, is the third off of his Audible Doctor produced <em>Made In The Street</em>s. Check the visuals after the jump.\n<!--more-->\nAudible Doctor, a member of the Brooklyn based producer/rapper collective The Brown Bag All-Stars, was recently tapped to work with the likes of Jay-Z and Jay Electronica. His production style lends well to Fredro's flow – which is better than ever. It's been almost a decade since he released his last solo project.\n\nThe video sheds some light on the prominence of the iconic Ralph Lauren Polo Sport brand within the urban community –specifically within the NYC scene. It's that good hip-hop, and with the rumoured battle with Keith Murray swirling, it's dope to see/hear this type of flow and delivery from the usually turnt up spit kicker. He is way more lyrical than he often gets credit for.\n\nCop the album <a href=\"http://www.undergroundhiphop.com/fredro-starr-made-in-the-streets/GM14010CD/\">here</a>!\n\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/j0YWtmz8\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe><br /><br />",

    "content_html": "From 1994 — 1999 comedian Joe Clair, and co-host Big Les, brought us the best in hip-hop culture on BET's Rap City. We recently chatted with Joe, who shared some stories, fond memories of Rap City, his thoughts on 106th & Park going off the air and his mixtape. Be sure to follow Joe on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/joeclair\">Twitter</a> for all his updates and show dates. Interview after the jump.\n\n<!--more-->\n\n<strong>How did you get involved with BET?</strong>\n\nI had just graduated from college, and I felt like there was space for an educated, sort of collegiate voice in hip-hop, and I thought that I could be him. I was living in DC at the time – the BET headquarters wasn't not too far from where I lived, so I picked up the phone, called 411, got the number and started calling these guys on a regular basis. I was leaving messages for the producer on his answering machine. I called this guy for about, maybe ten months to a year – I can't remember correctly – but it was about that long.\n\nIn the interim, one of the associate producers saw me perform, and a month later after he saw me perform, a friend of mine was going to DJ on 'Rap City', but they didn't have a place to shoot – so I asked them, \" Why don't you come to my house and shoot?\" The next day, 'Rap City' came to my house.\n\n<strong>[chuckles] -- That's an amazing story\n</strong>\nYeah man, that's how I felt. You could imagine it happening to you. That's how I felt. When they showed up the associate producer was like, \"man, what's your name?\" I told him \"Joe Clair.\" He asked, \"you're a comedian, right?\" I was like \"yeah.\" He said he saw me open for Paul Mooney and thought I was hilarious. He said maybe we could do some things together. A couple of minutes later, in walks the guy I was looking for – who I'd been calling – and the rest is history, so to speak.\n\n<strong>What were some of your best memories of being on 'Rap City’? </strong>\n\nBest memories – man it's hard to pinpoint. Imagine being in your twenties, and single, and a comedian. So I'm touring and I'm doing all the comedy stuff, and I 'm on television five days a week, interviewing rappers. I want to say the whole thing was my best memory of 'Rap City', you know what I mean? But some of the outstanding moments would be...the realization that I got one of the final interviews that Biggie gave or that I was sitting and smoking a blunt with Tupac while he played the Makavelli album before it came out.\n\n<em>In the audio clip below Joe shared with another memory – meeting Rakim for the first time at the <a href=\"http://hiphopmagazinearchive.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/xxl-7.jpg\"><em>Greatest Day In Hip-Hop History</em></a> cover shoot.</em>\n\n<iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/180751929&color=ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false\" width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" frameborder=\"no\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe>\n<blockquote><strong>Smoking a blunt with Biggie – days before he died – was mind-blowing</strong></blockquote>\n<strong>'Rap City' literally went from being in the streets, to becoming a more structured, \"polished\" production. What's your take on the evolution it took?</strong>\n\nAt that time, it took on the eventual life that we had been dreading from the start and that's when the powers that be, that didn't have a real foot in the culture, got their hands on it. It was going to be exploited, and – not to say that I'm mad at that – I wasn't looking forward to that if it meant the playing down of some of the <em>authenticity</em>, some of the <em>intelligence</em>, some of the stuff that <em>actually</em> made it a culture. Playing down of the other aspects of hip hop that didn't generate money so much, but made it what hip hop was. They forgot about breakdancing, and they forgot about graffiti – they forgot about <em>all</em> that. We live in a capitalistic society so of course I suppose this had to happen but at the expense of what? Well, now we can look back and see what the expense was.\n\n<strong>Tell me about your album<em> <a href=\"http://www.datpiff.com/Joe-Clair-20-Years-Too-Late-mixtape.446900.html\">20 Years Too Late</a></em>.</strong>\n\nI've done a lot of things since 'Rap City', man. You just keep going; you know what I mean? I got into entertainment as a comedian, and I got into <em>media</em> through my love of hip hop. But from that, I've got a complete knowledge of how the entertainment industry operates – what works, what doesn't work and a lot of life lessons along the way. The album that you just talked about, or the mixtape as I like to call it, was a culmination of where I had been, and I thought that now was the time for a voice that didn't sound like all of the other voices. I feel like that project was a precursor to something bigger for me. I don’t know exactly what that 'bigger' is yet. You know in life things play themselves out all the time, so look forward to hearing my voice in some way real soon. And either with a bigger message or with more wattage, so to speak, you know what I mean?\n\n<em>In the clip below, Joe shares his thoughts on 106th & Park going off the air.</em>\n\n<iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/180752597&color=ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false\" width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" frameborder=\"no\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe>\n\nListen to Joe Clair's <em>20 Years Too Late</em> <a href=\"http://www.datpiff.com/Joe-Clair-20-Years-Too-Late-mixtape.446900.html\">here</a>.\n\n— Riley Wallace",

    "content_html": "Many purists (including myself) describe hip-hop as a culture – one full of prominent (era and regionally specific) slang, dances and fashion elements that almost serve(d) as a dress code, for lack of a better term. When hip-hop was in it's commercial infancy, there were a number of iconic footwear must-haves that defined a generation and made a mint along the way. Unfortunately, they weren't all J's, Air Force Ones and Adidas shelltoe sneakers. Many brands who were on top dropped like a bag of bricks – and a few of them for obscure reasons. We revisit a couple of them after the jump. We also found some great <a href=\"https://www.naturerated.com/best-ice-fishing-boots/\">ice fishing boots</a> for the outdoor enthusiast.\n<!--more-->\n<strong>British Knights</strong>\n\n<a href=\"http://aboveaveragehiphop.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/IMG_1762.png\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-683\" src=\"http://aboveaveragehiphop.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/IMG_1762.png\" alt=\"IMG_1762.PNG\" width=\"100%\" /></a>\n\nBritish Knights were so dope! Endorsed by athletes like Dominique Wilkins, they appeared in high profile hip-hop videos and even had commercials with Hammer. They had a great run! So why did they taper off in popularity?\n\nIn the early 1990s the Crips street gang wore the shoes and took the “BK” logo to indicate “Blood Killer” (allegedly). This led to many schools and universities banning the shoes from being worn – a huge blow. This, along with the changing landscape and fickle nature of the hip hop culture all contributed to the brand's demise.\n\nBK’s made a comeback back in 2008, and you can still cop releases of the classic sneaks online and in fine sneaker retailers on your block.\n\n<strong>Troop Sport</strong>\n\n<a href=\"http://aboveaveragehiphop.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/IMG_1761.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-684\" src=\"http://aboveaveragehiphop.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/IMG_1761.jpg\" alt=\"IMG_1761.JPG\" width=\"100%\" /></a>\n\nTroop Sport was a go-to urban brand in the 80’s – the were worn by the likes of LL Cool J, and 3rd Bass. They were doing well until an ugly rumor began to surface. It was said that the Ku Klux Klan owned the company and that ‘Troop’ was actually an acronym for ‘To Rule Over Oppressed People’. It was also said that if you cut open the lining of a jacket, a message read; “Thank you ni**er for making us rich”. Claims were made that coded messages were also integrated into the tread of their sneakers. Sounds stupid right?\n\nFor a young company whose main market was African American and Latino youth, these accusations were particularly devastating. It didn’t seem to matter that the company’s founders were not \"white\" themselves - they were Jewish and Korean. With sales virtually, non-existant, the company eventually went bankrupt. <em>Of course</em> the rumors weren’t true.\n\nLast we heard, rapper Nelly was reviving the brand.\n\n<strong>Ewing Athletics</strong>\n\n<a href=\"http://aboveaveragehiphop.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/IMG_1765.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-685\" src=\"http://aboveaveragehiphop.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/IMG_1765.jpg\" alt=\"IMG_1765.JPG\" width=\"100%\" /></a>\n\nFor most of the 1988-89 season, Parrick Ewing wore an unbranded white shoe –toward the end of the season, Ewing, in partnership with Pony founder Roberto Mueller, unveiled the Ewing Athletics brand. They made approximately $100 million that year.\n\nThe iconic 33 Hi sneaker was worn by anyone who was <em>anyone</em> at the time. The company released over 20 sneakers before folding in 1996. Reasons for the closure included the changing marketplace, which saw the rise of sneaker alternatives such as the Timbaland Boot. The company was relaunched in 2008 and the sneakers are available at select retailers.\n\n<hr />\n\nWhich iconic brands do you remember and miss? <a href=\"http://www.twitter.com/aboveaveragehh\">Tweet us</a> and let us know!\n\n— Riley Wallace",

If you look to other genres of music like rock and roll, artists like The Rolling Stones can sell-out shows anytime, anywhere. This is largely due to the fact that fans <em>grew</em> with them and can link their music to specific periods in their life.\n<!--more-->\nWe have similar artists in the hip-hop/neo-soul (alternative) music world – think artists Outkast, Erykah Badu, The Roots or even a group like M.O.P. Performers that reached extreme heights of commercial success at <em>one point or another</em> and gained notoriety using a specific formula. Artists like Erykah Badu continue to make music that, although experimental at times, does not venture outside the comfort zone of it’s core audience (NOT a bad thing). The opposite can have disastrous results, as we experienced when Lauren Hill did string of highly criticized shows that saw her revisiting and reimagining her classics.\n\nEnter platinum selling artist D’Angelo, a neo-soul messiah who brought us hits like <em><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1WGn7da0co\">Untitled (How Does It Feel)</a></em>, <em><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eT75hdcOOkU\">Left & Right</a></em>, <em><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_WzjiTzZBA\">Brown Sugar</a></em>, <em><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBB8valskCQ\">Lady</a></em>, <em><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nbG4QYKzRZE\">Devil’s Pie</a></em> and <em><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JAfuUZRou7g\">Cruisin'</a></em>. His two commercial releases <em>Brown Sugar</em> and <em>VooDoo</em> are often cited as two of the most <em>excellent</em> and <em>singular</em> R&B albums of the past 15 years. He’s worked with the likes of J.Dilla, Dr. Dre, DJ Premier Common and more.\n\nNumerous set-backs, including legal and personal health issues, prevented the completion and release of his long-awaited third LP, which was tentatively named <em>River James</em>. Today, after 14 years of waiting, fans (including us) woke up to find the album, which ended up being titled <em>Black Messiah</em>, was gracing our Spotify accounts. Our upfront impression – we love it. To put it simply –do you like D’Angelo? You’ll love this album.\n\nHe gives his core audience exactly what they want from him, in a good way. Although it includes writing credited to Q-Tip and production credit from Questlove (and others), the largely self-produced album is a gem. From the buttery <em>Sugah Daddy</em>, the super smooth, head nodding <em>Prayer</em>, the Questlove co-produced <em>The Charade</em> or our current fave <em>Till It’s Done (Tutu)</em>, D’Angelo gives us a project completely on par with his other work, not an easy feat. A great listen front to back – definitely add this album to your collection, playlist, etc.\n\nGrab the album now, available anywhere you buy music.\n\n<iframe src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/EJDTZRcShcY\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe>\n\n<iframe src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/WD1oaBCmZWA\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe>",

    "content_html": "Sometimes a little mystery is a good thing – and you can’t beat suspense when it comes to generating buzz. This was the case over the summer as rap fans argued (quite convincingly) that an new EP, which surfaced on SoundCloud, was actually recorded by the legendary Queensbridge rapper Nas under the moniker \"Your Old Droog\". How convincing was it? Well Droog, who <em>obviously</em> isn’t Nas, released a video of himself rapping and fans proclaimed it <strong>fake</strong>. It wasn’t until his notorious live performance this past September that the rumours were laid to rest and the world could finally put a face to the name.\n\n<!--more-->\n\n<iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/playlists/37967285&color=ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false\" width=\"100%\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"no\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe>\n\nHaving since blazed countless radio shows, and handing Sway’s Five Fingers Of Death, Droog re-released his infamous EP commercially – including some extended mixes, remixes and unreleased tracks. stand-outs on this stellar release are Nutty Bars, Free Turkey, 48th street and Gunsmoke Cologne – and we can’t leave out the track that sparked the initial controversy Loosie In The Store With Pennies.\n\nThere is zero commercial or industry influence on this project. It’s built of boom-bap, old school references and long instrumental song outros. Simply put – it’s gorgeous. If you’re a rap fan who appreciates BARS above all else, Droog is a breath of fresh air.\n\n<strong>A MUST LISTEN!</strong>\n\n<iframe src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/CZZO9EueT4s\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe>\n\n<iframe src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/RANma8RhA6g\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe>\n\n<hr />\n\n \n<blockquote>Note: This top 5 is solely that of Riley \"Special\" Wallace and doesn't explicitly reflect the view of all aboveaveragehiphop.com's staff and writers.</blockquote>",

    "content_html": "The Wu-Tang Clan is legendary, no argument there. The argument <em>does</em> arise when we’re discussing who are your fave spitters from the (originally) nine-man Staten-Island outfit. Method Man, regardless of solo-success <em>always</em> seems to get a pass and Chef is universally accepted as one of its greats – but I think it’s impossible to not praise GFK for his innovation and sheer work ethic. He recently blessed us with his 10th solo effort <em>36 Seasons</em>, a gorgeous conceptual album released on Tommy Boy Records.\n<!--more-->\nConceptual albums are no small feat – and few have really done the format as much justice as Price Paul and Raekwon; although, GFK does a great job weaving a lyrically strong story that follows his return home after a nine year prison sentence. He finds it hard to stay away from the game (especially after learning his girl has <a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/tommy-boy-1/lovedontliveherenomore\">moved on with another man</a>) and returns to a life of crime only to be set-up. The story, which plays out over 14 songs features a supporting cast of characters played by AZ, Kool G Rap, Tre Williams, Pharoahe Monch, Rell, Kadence Springs, Shawn Wigs and The Revelations.\n\n<iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/176891335&color=ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false\" width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" frameborder=\"no\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe>\n\nStandouts for us were <em>Emergency Procedure</em>, which sees Ghostface being saved after the botched heist by a Doctor played by Pharoahe Monch, and <em>Blood In the Streets</em>, which sees Ghostface out for vengeance against the man who double crossed him (played by AZ). The one maybe 'con' of this project, if you want to call it that, is that many of the songs seem wildly out of context outside of the album – which should be a better reason to give this a front to back spin. It's also an inescapable by-product of this format.\n\nA playful mix of introspective soul and gritty hiphop, Ghostface’s 36 Seasons is all of the creativity and wordplay that we’ve come to expect from GFK – too bad we didn’t enjoy the <em><a href=\"http://aboveaveragehiphop.com/wu-tang-clan-a-better-tommorow-review/\">A Better Tomorrow</a></em> as much as this one!\n\nIt’s available now everywhere you can cop music – a MUST LISTEN.\n\n<iframe src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/RKR0ZzcVhTQ\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe>\n\n<hr />\n\n<blockquote>Note: This top 5 is solely that of Riley \"Special\" Wallace and doesn't explicitly reflect the view of all aboveaveragehiphop.com's staff and writers.</blockquote>",

I admit, I slept on him for a while before delving in (<em>pause</em>). For those who are a fan of the young king – his latest 2014 Forest Hill Drive is a personal, poignent example of good hip-hop. Over 13 tracks, Cole eloquently rocks his heart on his sleeve and struts over subject matter that ranges from first (and various) sexual experiences to issues of race and self-worth.\n<!--more-->\nThe album is largely produced by Cole himself, with some exceptions – <em>'03 Adolesence</em>, <em>Tale of 2 Cities</em> and <em>Love Truly</em> were produced by Willie B., Vinylz and !llmind/Cardiak respectively. The other exceptions have Cole \"co-producing\", so he is extremely hands on (and it shows). From blasting white rappers on the banging <em>Fire Squad</em>, chasing dreams on the Mobb Deep sampled <em>St. Tropez</em> or flexing hindsight and regret on <em>Apparently</em>, Cole shows a lot of himself on this record – and his honesty is paying off.\n\n<iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/playlists/62258142&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true\" width=\"100%\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"no\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe>\n\nThe album has thus far been extremely well received by fans around the world, and with good reason. Cole is just a good dude.

The 9 song self-titled effort is, in short, <strong>everything you wanted it to be</strong>.\n\n<!--more-->Using nothing but instruments from acclaimed composer Adrian Younge, the two create a project that simply ignores mainstream radio, and give fans what they want – how refreshing is that? They also do it in a digestible way. By that I mean, of course,  bar heavy artists have the propensity to create songs that are a <em>little too</em> much for casual listening (i.e Canibus, etc, etc).

Madlib has a habit of being an OCD producer who makes brilliant soulful beats that are so dope they can stand on their own without any lyrics. Together they blessed the world this year with <em>Piñata</em> – a project name that actually doubles as a \"group\" name.\n\n<!--more-->Upon first listen, it's impossible for fans to not instantly compare the production focus and playlist flow of the album to<em> Madvillain</em>, Madlib's collaborative album with the ever illusion MF Doom. Piñata, however, benefits from being slightly more linear (topic wise). Gibbs rides the soulful beats on tracks like Deeper, Thuggin' and Scarface – exploring lost love, street life and retrospective hindsight.\n\n<iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/172612146&color=ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false\" width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" frameborder=\"no\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe>\n\nIt's such a dope album – from start to finish.

    "content_html": "<p class=\"p1\">Chicago is indeed a bright, vibrant hub of music. The city has birthed careers of greats ranging from Curtis Mayfield and Chaka Khan, to R.Kelly, Common and Kanye West. It's also, as of late, become the nucleus of the drill movement, which has been led by artists like Chief Keef, Lil' Herb and Lil' Durk. It's the definition of musical melting pot.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><!--more-->Enter <a href=\"http://xvrhldy.tumblr.com/\">XVRHLDY</a> (pronounced Xavier Holliday), the new face and sound of the Chicago music scene. With a vocal range that (sonically) makes us think of a young 3 Stacks (Andre 3000), Xavier is bringing a unique style/sound – and it's not going unnoticed. He was recently featured by big publications like The Source and XXL, and the list goes on. His highly anticipated <em>Need To Know II: LUNA</em>, dropping early 2015, will feature the likes of Pete Rock, Saba, NoName Gypsy, Joey Purp and Odd Couple, among others.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">We took some time out to chat with <a href=\"http://xvrhldy.tumblr.com/\">Xavier</a> (interview below).</p>\n\n\n<hr />\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>Tell us about how you got into hip-hip</strong></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">I've been performing since I was young – my mother used to make me memorize long speeches, like 6 pages, and recite them in front of large crowds of people at church functions. So I've always been comfortable in front of an audience.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">As far as hip-hop goes, I actually didn't grow up listening to it. When I was younger, I was more more into punk rock – Panic At The Disco, Fall Out Boy, All American Rejects (etc). The first rap I ever really heard was Beastie Boys, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVZEM3nRr5o\"><em>Licensed To Ill</em></a>. I actually had that on cassette tape. That's where it started for me, I started writing raps and poems and it grew from there.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>Tell us about your music. Who are some of your influences?</strong></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">I don't like to really give influences, because I feel like I don't fashion myself to sound like anybody – but in terms of the actual sound of my voice, I've been told I sound like André (3000) a lot, just as far as the southern drawl we both have. As far as actual influences, I pull most of my inspiration from my life and what I go through rather than from an artist. From my abstract thoughts.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>Walk us through your current projects.</strong></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">I have a few older projects, from before I was as serious as I am now, but I'd say my most important project to date has been my <a href=\"http://xvrhldy.tumblr.com/post/75616425756/download-need-to-know\"><em>Need To Know</em> EP</a>.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">I originally wanted to make a whole album. I was living in NYC at the time and my circle there (including my producer), after hearing the sounds I was making, told me not to waste them. Rather, that I should release them properly – hence the EP. That was really something that I released to hold my fans over while I fine tune the album. Crazy thing about that project is that it was written and recorded in 3 weeks, but it doesn't at all sound rushed.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>Right now your getting a lot of attention from the industry. How does that feel?</strong></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">It really inspires me to keep going. People don't always get to see the work you put in you know? It's like studying for school finals; nobody really sees the effort you put in at home, just the overall performance in the exam. It's inspiring that people are noticing what my vision is and what I've been working on. It feels hella good, and I'm going to just keep pushing.</p>\n\n\n<hr />\n\n<blockquote>\n<p class=\"p1\">In the audio clip below, XZVHLDY gives us his take on the current Chicago music scene and the influence of the Chi-Town sound.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p class=\"p1\"><iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/180756370&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true\" width=\"100%\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"no\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></p>\n\n\n<hr />\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>What are you working on now? Do you have an album coming?</strong></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">I actually have two projects coming soon. One is a shorter project, which is actually a sequel to Need To Know –<em>Need To Know II: LUNA –</em>that's actually finished now. It's just being mixed. I plan on dropping another video before that too. As well, l'm working on making sure the album sounds the way I want it to sound. That should be out in the summer.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>We're looking forward to that! Any last words for our blog?</strong></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">I appreciate you interviewing me! I'm in a particularly good mood today, I'm at Starbucks drinking the white cocoa – and I <em>love</em> the white cocoa! <strong>I'm in love the cocoa</strong> man, the <em>white</em> cocoa!</p>\n\n\n<hr />\n\n<blockquote>\n<p class=\"p1\">UPDATE: since giving this Interview, XVRHLDY did in fact release a new video – a short film he directed called \"The Root”.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p class=\"p1\"><iframe src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/nq2QSyPFznE\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></p>",

    "content_html": "<p class=\"p1\">Like father like son – it's impossible not to recall this saying when listening to the young rapper Chris Rivers from the Bronx. Chris is the son of the Latin multiple-syllable legend Big Pun, who rose to (platinum) prominence in the 90's as a member of the Terror Squad. Far from the only child-of-a-rapper out there nowadays (i.e Eazy E's son, Run's kids and even the son of the late ODB), Chris sets himself apart from the pack by striving to create a personal brand that falls outside the shadow of his father's enormous (no <em>pun</em> intended) legacy. He's a humble kid who'd been putting in an incredible amount of work, and it shows in the most important place  – his music. Check out our interview with Chris Rivers after the jump.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><!--more--></p>\n\n\n<hr />\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>Introduce yourself to the people</strong></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">What’s good people? My name is Chris Rivers, and I’m the son of the late great Big Pun<span class=\"s1\">. I’m an artist from the Bronx (the <em>dragon</em>).</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>Tell me a bit about your background and how you got into Hip-Hop.</strong></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Obviously being the son of someone who was so heavily involved in the scene, I was always around it as a child. I grew up in studios – but, I mean, he died when I was six, and I wasn’t involved (in music) at that point. However, like any child who grew up without a parent will tell you, music fills a void. I was always influenced by it, and it's always been a part of my life. I’ve always been naturally talented with words and writing and after high-school, about 3-4 years ago, I started to pursue this seriously. Thank goodness for the internet – I began releasing music/videos, and they just caught fire. I’ve come a long away but know I still have a long way to go.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>Who are some of your influences and top artists?</strong></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Black thought, Eminem, My Father, Mos Def, Lupe Fiasco – and newer artists like Kendrick Lamar and J. Cole. I like stuff with substance and lyrical content.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>Talk about your releases thus far.</strong></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Wonderland of Misery <a href=\"http://www.datpiff.com/Chris-Rivers-Wonderland-Of-Misery-mixtape.491676.html\">1</a> & <a href=\"http://www.datpiff.com/Chris-Rivers-Wonderland-Of-Misery-2-mixtape.613789.html\">2</a> are available now on DatPiff – and they are an embodiment of myself. I took my time on my music. You can hear my progression over those two tapes. If you want to get a sense of who I am as an artist, definitely get your hands on those. I also have the EP that we put on I-Tunes.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>Do you, or <em>did</em> you feel any pressure based on who your father is?</strong></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">I did feel more pressure when I first started – I mean my dad is a legend, and one of my fave rappers. Not just because he’s my dad, but because he’s legitimately one of the best to ever do it. I mean I’ll be on the street or on the bus (or whatever) and see people with tattoos of him, and they’ve never even met him. To be that iconic is really heavy. That being said, I knew that if I was going to do this, that I had to deliver at a certain caliber. I knew people would definitely hold me to that, so it’s a gift and a curse. It keeps me on my toes, and really motivated me to give my 100%. I’ve found that as I’ve grown though, I feel less and less pressure – as I become my own person and become more comfortable with my own identity on the mic.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/183951530&color=ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false\" width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" frameborder=\"no\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>I think it’s admirable that you keep it so, for lack of a better term, <em>100</em> in your music. I mean on tracks like<a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/kevinmadera/chris-rivers-the-destroyer-prod-by-kevin-madera\"><em> The Destroyer</em></a>, and<a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/zareen_53/i-feel-you-chris-rivers\"><em> I Feel You</em></a>, you get extremely personal.</strong></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">There is definitely a misconception about me – a lot of people think I came up rich or a certain way. It's crazy to see people debating on forums and comment sections with me about <em>my life</em>. I’ve just tried to keep my music as honest/real as possible. I don’t want there to be a separation between the artist and the person. Everything I talk about has either happened to me or been witnessed by me – so when you listen to my records, you can know that you’re getting the true story.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>There are a lot of cats around now who are children of famous artists. How important was it for you to build a brand outside of your father’s legacy?</strong></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">It’s one of the most important things for me and I don’t knock these other guys – I mean I’ve toured with the likes of Young ODB and JoJo (and others). They’re all good dudes, and everyone has a different take on it, but I think I have a sense of individuality. I’ve always wanted to be my artist, and that holds a lot of weight to me – and that in turn holds weight with other people. I mean some cats may be more comfortable paying homage, but I try to stay away from that as far as me establishing my name. Maybe later on in my career I’d be more open to things like that, but as of now my brand and image is my priority.</p>\n\n\n<hr />\n\n<blockquote>\n<p class=\"p1\"><em>In the clip below Chris gives his take on the current NYC hip-hop scene</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/180756638&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true\" width=\"100%\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"no\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe>\n\n<hr />\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>What’s coming up for Chris Rivers? </strong></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">First quarter of 2015 I have a project dropping called <em>Let Me Show You</em>.

After the pleasantries were out of the way, Killa Cam, Jim Jones, Freeky Zeeky and Juelz Santana hopped on the microphone to show out. Check the video out after the jump.<!--more--></p>\n<iframe src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/_2G-vWqZzIc\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">\"Now a days they all wanna hustle giffys, in my day all wanted to hustle sniffy\"\n- Jim Jones</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p class=\"p1\">Jim and Cam definitely had bars for days – although Juelz came up a <em>bit</em> light. In his defence he didn't have headphones for some inexplicable reason (WTF?). Anyways, it's great to see them back together – it kind of made us feel like we were back in 2002 – 2003 (in a good way).</p>",

    "content_html": "<p class=\"p1\">Last night when I made my way to my mailbox I had only one thing on my mind – Big Pun. A week earlier, after hitting up producer Domingo on Twitter, I was about to receive a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AboveAverageHH/status/552822509847216128/photo/1\">USB key with a WAV version of his new Big Pun EP</a> <em>Bronx Legends Never Die</em>, the first official (Rios family sanctioned) Big Pun release since 2000’s <em>Yeah Baby</em>.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p class=\"p1\">Being Latin, everybody has their idols in Hip Hop and it’s definitely not a biased thing but people idolized Biggie or they idolized Pac and people do idolize Pun but being that I’m Latin… Latin people hold Pun on this pedestal but I feel that his legacy doesn’t get pushed enough.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>- Domingo discussing his motivation for the EP (BREAL TV)</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p class=\"p1\">The EP had a limited CD release of only 350, which Domingo pre-sold as part of an indiegogo campaign. Unfortunately I missed the boat, but was excited that domingo was willing to ship a USB. After unpacking and booting up my PC I finally pressed play – wow! This isn’t an over-produced posthumous release that many legends have suffered, this is a raw, hip-hop project that Pun would be proud of.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The EP features remixes/reworks and a few new/unreleased tracks – namely <em>From the X</em> and the epic <em>Lyrically Fit</em>. the latter features not only Shaq, Cormega and Easy Mo Bee [wow...mind blown], but also Pun’s son <a title=\"Meet Chris Rivers, Son Of The Late Great Big Pun\" href=\"http://aboveaveragehiphop.com/meet-chris-rivers-son-late-great-big-pun/\">Chris Rivers</a> who comes in right after his father. Another big tune is Symphony 2000 featuring Kool G Rap, Truck Turner and KRS One. The remixes, as well, are ridiculous – you need Domingo’s Dream Shatterer remix in your life (trust me).</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The EP also includes some production from the infamous Dr.G, who has produced for Wu-Tang, Kool G Rap and more – and Domingo (if you aren’t familiar) is a legend in his own right. You should cruise through his <a href=\"http://domingobeats.com/discography/\">discography</a>.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Probably the most engaging (and touching) part of the EP are the memories that were shared by Pun fans. Domingo asked fans to be a part of this project and they supplied him with drops via Facebook. This is (overall) a great listen – highly recommended for old and new fans alike. It will be available on I-Tunes January 18th. Go support great music!</p>\n\n\n<hr />\n<p class=\"p1\"><iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/183951530&color=ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false\" width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" frameborder=\"no\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></p>",

    "content_html": "When I was a kid rappers had demo tapes – and I'm not talking about mp3s or even cds. I'm talking actual cassette tapes. During the golden era of hip-hop, you either had access to a proper studio, or you recorded demo tapes in your closet. Either way, when played today, classic demo tapes provide an authentic sound and feel that is hard to replicate by digital means. Over the next few weeks we'll be exploring some of the dopest demos we've come across – from unreleased b-sides, original versions of classics to reference tracks and unearthed gems. Hold on to your hats kiddies, we're about to do some digging.\n\n<hr />\n\n<strong>A Tribe Called Quest</strong>\n\nAs pivotal members of the Native Tongues, and early affiliates of the Jungle Brothers, the squad, consisting of Q-Tip, Phife Dawg, Jerobe and Ali Shaheed Muhammed ushered in the jazzy sound that purists still run with today. If you haven't watched their movie, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=izT2Xmw1X3M\">do so immediately</a>. Anyways, the demo below is a collection of snippets off their original demo tape – and it's glorious. It includes demos of classics like <em>Description of a Fool</em>, <em>Left My Wallet In El Segundo</em> and an unreleased track that we've never heard before.\n\n<iframe src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/-8E3g-x6bH4\" width=\"640\" height=\"480\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe>\n\n<hr />\n\n<strong>Wu-Tang Clan</strong>\n\nWu-Tang is pretty much the most successful group of its kind – and they have the discography to prove it. Below is a copy of their original 1992 demo tape, which I'll disclaimer <em>may</em> only appeal to the real heads. If that sounds like you, this 28 demo is a treasure cove of amazing shit – from the demo version of <em>Tearz</em> to an alternate version of <em>Bring The Ruckus</em>. It also has some shit we hadn't heard before. Worth a listen for any fan of the clan.\n\n<iframe src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/IDddsRCjoi4\" width=\"640\" height=\"480\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe>\n\n<hr />\n\n<strong>DMX</strong>\n\nThis one is interesting; it's a relic from the period in between early 90's <em>Born Loser</em> DMX, who was kind of <em>meh</em>, and the 1996 <em>It's Dark And Hell Is Hot</em> X, who we actually wish we could have back! DMX has definitely gone through his share of ups and pretty embarrassing downs, but it's impossible to deny how much we all enjoyed listening to his old shit. This is a joint that, from what we know, was recorded in '95 – and it holds up. Worth a spin.\n\n<iframe src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/1baObMZlVdE\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe>\n\n<hr />\n\n<strong>Kanye West</strong>\n\nIn his own words, Kanye West is the most inspirational artist of our generation. Whether or not you agree, it's impossible to argue his success. He's definitely blessed us with a discography of songs (and beats) that make for a strong case. We've all heard the stories of how he was a rapper all along, and after much grinding, Dame Dash finally heard him out – and the rest is history. This, from what we can figure, is the tape that he played for Dame and Jigga. He's far from transforming to full <em>Yeezus</em> yet at this point, but he still had bars and beats. Give it an ear.\n\n<iframe src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/MmuScV9yC-4\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe>",

    "content_html": "It's no secret that I'm a real hip-hop head. I was born in the early 80's, and I grew up in the 90's surrounded by what I consider to be the best of hip-hop as a genre – and I feel that it (for the most part) still is. With that in mind, I'll now proceed to finally weigh in on the whole Iggy vs the world conversation.\n\nIs she a deep thinker who makes the thoughtful, well-written brand of hip-hop I love? No. For that reason, I don't consume it. So much so, that it's almost unfair for me to analyze it. What we can say with certainty though, is that her fans buy it. They shower her with undying adoration, buy tickets to her shows and (violently) defend her honour 140 characters at a time. When is the last time you did any of that for your favourite artists?\n<blockquote>Instead of tweeting about how much you hate her [Iggy Azalea], perhaps you can tweet about the latest record by Skyzoo or D'Angelo?</blockquote>\nMusic is a business, which means it's a for profit outfit that enjoys generating return on investment. There was a time when artists we worship and consider architects were in expensive studios recording big budget projects, because that's what we wanted. That's right – we were <em>actually</em> going to stores and buying their shit, packing up their shows, etc. That all stopped though; albeit it was kind of gradual. Nowadays people love to scream about how hip-hop isn't <em>real</em> – but didn't purchase Sadat X's past release, or rush out to support that latest Craig G effort. You catch my drift? Hip-Hop changed, but so did it's core of paying customers.\n\nMy hypothesis is that we grew up – let's face it, nobody young is that upset about any of this. It's us real heads who watched hip-hop grow from nothing into a feared outcry from black America. We watched as the highest powers tried – and failed miserably – to silence hip-hop. We're the ones who are mad that the thing we loved is being perverted into this corporate behemoth that appears to be shutting us out. That isn't hip-hop though. There I said it. All that shit we're protesting is about as hip-hop as Vanilla Ice, MC Hammer, PM Dawn, etc. Wack hip-hop <em>irregardless</em> of race, has long sold millions and been awarded Grammys and AMAs.\n\nHip-Hop is a culture, and it still thrives (in its purest form) today – but it needs our help. Are you mad that corporate America (i.e a group of old white people with suits) is allowing (for the most part) talentless rich kids take over the thing you love? Why not support the hundreds of real artists out there? Why don't we all band together and support all the artists who are preserving the culture? Why don't we stop just sitting around and actually make a change? Hip-hop was born an underdog, so going against the <em>machine</em> really shouldn't be something that scares us.\n\nIn an attempt to round back, I'll say that Iggy Azalea is a cog in the machine. None of this is her fault. She is making music, and people are buying it – it's supply and demand and it's the way business works. TI is no worse than Akon, who brought us Lady Gaga and Usher, who brought us Bieber. Instead of tweeting about how much you hate her, perhaps you can tweet about the latest record by Skyzoo or D'Angelo? Just saying.\n\n<iframe width=\"640\" height=\"360\" src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/FadzGGJiLTg\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>",

When it's kind of messed up, but you can't stop consuming it, the artist is doing something right!\n\nThat's how I felt after watching the (Worldstar Hip-Hop) video for The Grey Jones Club's <em>Severed Dick</em>. The title alone is click bait – and the video has a total NSFW twist. There's also that bonus though, the one I was talking about. She has bars, and an entertaining delivery. I immediately googled her and checked out her debut mixtape <em>Manic Pixie Dream Whore</em>.\n\nWith buzz happening around the song, and lack of detail about this girl as an artist, I had to find her and interview her. Check out our discussion below.\n\n<strong>Introduce yourself and maybe tell me a little about how you got into hip-hop.</strong>\n\nI'm The Grey Jones Club. I'm a rapper from Atlanta Georgia. I go by The Grey Jones Club because I've got so many styles I feel like I'm a group – and if my personality was a color it would probably be grey. I've been writing music since 2010 but <em>Manic Pixie Dream Whore</em> is my first completed project. I have the soul of an artist. I could've been a painter, a surrealist film director or a fucking mime – but rap music is my chosen medium. Growing up in poverty I wasn't exposed to fine arts and theatre and all that shit, so all the great artists I knew of and respected were rappers. I always wanted to be like them.\n\n<strong>Who were some of your influences?</strong>\n\nI listen to all types of rappers. I grew up on people like Nas, Mos Def, Common, Outkast and Dead Prez. You know, the <em>conscious</em> rappers and also the whole <em>neo soul</em> movement. Those things influenced my style. I'm also  from Atlanta, so I support a lot of the local artists out there. I love Atlanta and I love our sound so Jeezy, Gucci – and others – are also really big influences of mine. My favorite rapper of all time is Lil Wayne and I adore Chief Keef and Young Thug.\n<blockquote><img class=\"\" src=\"http://edge-img.datpiff.com/m29b5445/The_Grey_Jones_Club_Manic_Pixie_Dream_Whore-front-large.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"258\" height=\"258\" />\nDownload The Grey Jones Club's <em>Manic Pixie Dream Whore</em> from <a href=\"http://www.datpiff.com/The-Grey-Jones-Club-Manic-Pixie-Dream-Whore-mixtape.672629.html\">DatPiff</a></blockquote>\n<strong>How do you describe your music?</strong>\n\nMy music is like my personality. And I don't have just one personality, I have many. My music is cynical and naive. My music is self deprecating and cocky. My music is full of hope and desperation. My music goes through every emotion that I do. My music is honest.\n\nIts funny because in relationships I am very guarded, but in my music I put it all out there no matter how unflattering.\n\nMy music is my place to be free.\n\n<strong>Can you tell me about your latest project <em>Manic Pixie Dream Whore</em>?</strong>\n\nMPDW is my baby. Its my big dream finally peeking it's head out and allowing itself to be seen. I dropped the record in December. I started recording in June but the person who wrote those songs seems so long gone to me. I'll always love MPDW because I'll never be in that place again. It was me saying \"<em>Im a fucking rapper damn it, respect me as such\"! </em>To be honest, I'm already on to the next thing. But listen to it anyway! I heard it's really good!\n\n<strong>So everyone in my circle is talking about your <em>Severed Dick</em> song/video – what's the story behind that track?</strong>\n\nI wrote the song for Worldstar – shout out to Q. MPDG was already mastered and everything. I had the idea for the video in my head for a while. I just didn't have particular song in mind. I knew the penis mutilation video would be perfect for Worldstar because it would grab attention. I just needed a way to work the concept into the title so I could really make people wanna click. I was thinking about Dick Biter at first, but that didn't flow right to me. So I changed it to Severed Dick, heard the beat, started freestyling to myself, and that's how I got the song.\n\nFor the record, the song does <em>not</em> promote misandry in any way, shape or form. I just wanted to make a light hearted song that deals with dating from a realistic female perspective. So boys don't take it personally. Your man bits are safe with me.\n\n<iframe src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/GPDDmkqEVfY\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe>\n\n<strong>What are you currently working on?</strong>\n\nI'm in the process of recording my second mixtape <em>Mainstream</em>. Its going to be out April or May. Look out for that. Its gonna be like MPDW's big sister. Still me, but much more focused and refined.\n<blockquote>I could've been a painter, a surrealist film director or a fucking mime – but rap music is my chosen medium.\n\n- The Grey Jones Club</blockquote>\n<strong>What is your overall goal as an artist? What do you hope that people take away from your music?</strong>\n\nThere are so many female pioneers in hip hop that I have to thank for my existence. I could sit here and name them all, but anybody who supports female rappers already knows that much. I'm here to push it even further. Yes female rappers are getting shine now but we are still limited. There are no females out right now who rap how I rap, or who share my perspective. I have a way with words but my most valuable asset is my honesty. I have been through a lot, and struggled with depression and self esteem issues. I'm here to tell people its ok to be flawed. Those flaws are a part of what makes you who you are. None of the female musicians I looked up to growing up made me feel that way. They were all hiding behind this facade of perfection. I aim to change the way people view female rappers. I aim to be an Icon. A legend.\n\n<strong>Any last words for our readers?</strong>\n\nLike my shit. Share my shit. Scream about my shit from the mountain tops. Send my shit out via carrier pigeon. Just spread the word. I am what's next.\n\nFollow me on instagram: <a href=\"http://www.instagram.com/thegreyjonesclub\">thegreyjonesclub</a>\nFollow me on twitter: <a href=\"http://www.twitter.com/DaGreyJonesClub\">DaGreyJonesClub</a>\nFollow me on sound cloud: <a href=\"http://soundcloud.com/greyjones\" target=\"_blank\">soundcloud.com/greyjones</a>\nSubscribe to me on you tube: <a href=\"m.youtube.com/channel/UCPNS9oi_P0oP2fNRzO_gnEQ\">The Grey Jones Club</a>",

    "content_html": "What makes a great producer and/or mc? In my opinion, it's someone who loves/respects the culture and knows the history of it – and let's not forget they gotta be nice with it. J57 checks off all those boxes. A former Fat Beats NYC employee, J was mentored by DJ Premier and Marco Polo. A member of the Brown Bag All-Stars, he's quickly becoming a go-to producer and rhyme slinger. After listening to his latest release, the 2057 EP, I had to reach out to him.\n\nIn the interview below, he talks about how he connected with Brown Bag, DJ Premier's influence on his music, his upcoming projects and more.\n\n<strong>Introduce yourself to our readers.</strong>\n\nI'm J57. I'm an emcee/producer originally from Long Island but been living in Brooklyn for the past nine years.\n\n<strong>You're currently in Australia – can you share with us what you're doing there?</strong>\n\nI'm putting in studio work with Aussie heavy hitters like The Thundamentals, LMXEC, and more. I also found time to link up with the homies Joey Bada$$, CJ Fly and Statik Selektah to work on my solo album (where I rap over my beats).\n\n<strong>How did you get involved in hip-hop? Who were some of your influences?</strong>\n\nI became a fan of hip hop at a very young age. But, I didn't ''participate'' until 11th grade in high school when I started to freestyle and beatbox in ciphers at parties and high school, etc.\n\n<strong>You've mentioned that DJ Premier is a mentor to you – how did you first meet him?</strong>\n\nI met him when I worked at Fat Beats but became tight with him while at SIRIUS/XM at \"Rap Is Outta Control\" when he would fill in for DJ Eclipse, when he was on tour.\n\n<strong>How has he helped you develop as a producer?</strong>\n\nHe's helped my mentality as well as being able to see how he levels his beats on the mixing board; seeing how loud he puts the bass, the bass-kick, snare, hi-hat, etc. I would go home after a long session with him and just imitate what he did level-wise for a long time and that really helped my sound for sure. What I mean by mentality is, I picked up on a lot of key words that he always used to describe producers he thought were dope, by calling them \"creative\" and stuff like that, so it made me want to push the envelope even more. His work ethic is unparalleled and his passion for making quality music, as well, so I learned a lot from him in those departments, too, just from being in the same room with him.\n\n<strong>What's your relationship with Marco Polo?</strong>\n\nI met Marco 10 years ago at Fat Beats and became tight with him right away. He always took me under his wing, which I'll always be grateful for. I used not to put basslines on my beats because I was awful and didn't understand how to put them in key. He noticed and took me to Marco Polo bassline camp about 5 or 6 years ago. He's the type of person that would give you the shirt off his back, if you're down with him and has always given me his old records for samples, which has been such a great. To hear a sample he flipped and figured out how he flipped it.\n<blockquote><img src=\"https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/545320341724094464/NYhPPSNu.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"258\" />\nI would go home after a long session with him (Dj Premier) and just imitate what he did level-wise ... that really helped my sound...\n– J57</blockquote>\n<strong>You're a member of the Brown Bag All-Stars – how did you get involved with them?</strong>\n\nWe started Brown Bag AllStars back in the summer of 2007. We were all friends that worked at Fat Beats / met at Fat Beats and decided to get in the lab one day and the rest is history.\n\n<strong>Do you ever find it difficult being both an MC and (extremely) active producer?</strong>\n\nIt was close to impossible to do both for a good 7 years; there were years where I just focused on making beats and rapping took a backseat. There were times where I wouldn't make beats and just focus on rhyming...but now I have it all figured out. I'm finally 50/50 and just as passionate about both...and loving it!\n\n<strong>One of the projects you have coming up (that we're particularly excited about) is the Brown Bag x Pro Era collaboration project. Can you give us any details about it? What can we expect?</strong>\n\nThat album is the A La $OLE x J57 project. I first got in contact with A La a little over a year ago. He was on tour with the homie Joey Bada$$ and Joey was playing one of the joints I produced for him while on their tour bus, so he wanted beats. I dug his rhymes, so we organically linked up and decided to do a project. It's just some dope beats and rhymes. We're very like-minded as people and we're both as hungry as you can be, so expect us both to bring our \"A Game.\"\n\n<strong>You also have an upcoming record with one my fave artists, Homeboy Sandman. What can you tell me about that project? How did you connect him?</strong>\n\nWe're almost finished with our EP, and it's fucking dope. I met Sandman in 2008 or 2009 at Fat Beats and started working together from then on. He's one of my favorite people in the world; as an emcee and as a person. We have a joint on there that he said Peanut Butter Wolf went crazy over.....so I can die happy now haha.\n\n<strong>What else do you have coming up in 2015?</strong>\n\nKoncept & J57 \"The Fuel\" EP\nBrown Bag AllStars album\nAntcs EP (indie group I'm in with a singer named Vein aka Jesse Mechanic)\nTigereye (indie group I'm in with Joe Rogers and ATR)\nMAK3RS EP (indie group I'm in with a singer/producer named Matt Stamm)\nJ57 \"We Can Be Kings\" LP (where I rap over my beats)\nJ57 \"L/\\NDM1NES\" EP (instrumental)\nJ57 \"0057: FlaskLIFE\" EP (instrumental)\nMike Two EP Produced by me\n\n<strong>Top 3 albums ever – go!</strong>\n\nThe Mars Volta \"De-Loused in the Comatorium.\"\nNas \"Illmatic.\"\nRadiohead \"Kid A.\"\n\n<strong>How do you balance being part of so many groups and active DJ on Sirius XM?</strong>\n\nMy life is extremely scheduled from the second I wake up til the second I go to sleep. I kind of don't have time for much out side of music, which sucks, but it could be worse haha. I have every minute planned out a week in advance to get as much music made as possible each day. Don't have time for spontaneity.\n\n<strong>Do you have any last words you'd like to leave our readers with?</strong>\n\nGo to <a href=\"http://J57Music.com\">J57Music.com</a> right now to check out more of music!

    "content_html": "Welcome to part 2 of <em>Tale Of The Demo</em>. This week we're going to feature One Leg Up Records, who have pressed some amazing demo releases. What makes these releases even more awesome are the limited nature of them (roughly 200 each).\n\nSome of their most notable releases to date have been Herb McGruff's <em>Demo EP</em>, Beatnuts <em>Intoxicated Demos</em>, Pete Rock & CL Smooth <em>The Basement Demo</em>s and Lord Digga's <em>The High Plains Drifter EP</em>. They also released a highly praised Brand Nubian EP, which was a demo recorded just before <em>All For One</em>. \n\nSomething about hearing these demos on vinyl makes it even that more <em>special</em> for real heads. Unfortunately if you're reading this, you missed out – however you may still be able to find yourself a copy on discogs. If having it on vinyl isn't a priority, the bulk of One Leg Up's releases can be found on Spotify, You-Tube and so on. We compiled some stand-outs below!\n\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/videoseries?list=PLtfOw2sNYUoAL1jcMZWzRWsTUlOSlCxye\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\nLeading up their releases the label interviewed the artists and provided lots of great insight/detail – it's <a href=\"http://oneleguprecords.blogspot.com/?m=1\">worth a read</a>.\n\nNext week we'll take a look at some dope original versions of classic hip-hop tracks.\n\n— Keep Digging!",

    "content_html": "Hip-Hop Twitter was a buzz this weekend over a rant that Hot 97 DJ Funkmaster Flex unleashed upon <a href=\"http://www.mtv.com/news/2052808/funkmaster-flex-jay-z-rant/\">Jay-Z</a> and his <a href=\"http://www.mtv.com/news/2051498/dj-funkmaster-flex-rant-jay-z/\"><em>Life + Times</em> web team/writers</a>. His beef arose when a rep from Life + Times, who flex alleges had previously stolen ideas from his mobile app after an interview, emailed to ask for his involvement in the Dipset reunion – Flex took issue, as did the Dipset. What followed was a lot of stuff that will be hard to take back and a promptly released, sub-par, and frankly immature <a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/djfunkflexapp/ifwt-exclusive-the-diplomats-victory-freestyle-dipset2015\">early 2000's sounding diss track</a>.\n\n<iframe src=\"http://www.audiomack.com/embed4-large/rapxclusive/jay-z-rant\" width=\"100%\" height=\"265\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe>\n\nHowever, this is far from the first time that Funkmaster Flex, who got his start DJing the infamous Tunnel Nightclub, has used his status and platform to air grievances. Below I've compiled some of his most uncomfortable moments.\n<blockquote>“Don’t play with me man, don’t play with me...play me like I’m stupid, you’re going to see a different dude firing off on you. <i>On you</i>.”\n\n– Funkmaster Flex</blockquote>\n<strong>Flex vs Mr. Cee Haters</strong>\n\nWhen the legendary Mr. Cee, who is credited with helping discover an up and coming rapper named Biggie Smalls (no <em> big</em> deal), was arrested for soliciting a male prostitute, many fans were quick to denounce him. Flex, his longtime friend, came to his defence with a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y58phVjmz6s\">rant to end all rants</a>. It started with a <em>we don't discriminate</em> warning and ended with Flex all but <em>assuring</em> Cee's innocence and aiming crosshairs at Power 105. Cee has since come (partially) <a href=\"http://youtu.be/ngUrhkxhFeg\">clean about everything</a>, and left the station.\n\n<strong>Flex vs Nicki Minaj</strong>\n\nAfter Peter Rosenberg announced that Nicki Minaj was not real hip-hop live during Summer Jam, the hip-hop/pop diva was instructed by the YMCMB capo (Lil' Wayne) not to hit the stage – and she complied. Flex's response to the situation was to air her out on every platform he could. This escalated to a very tense (and kind of epic) <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2sISJZF8SE\">interview</a> that was both insightful and hard to listen to (at some points).\n\n<strong>Flex vs <span style=\"text-decoration: line-through;\">Nas</span> Steph Lova</strong>\n\nDuring an interview with Steph Lova, Nas, who is one of the most prolific lyricists of our generation, accused Flex of accepting <a href=\"http://www.daveyd.com/articleflexpayola.html\">payola to play records</a>. If you're not familiar, this means Flex was breaking the first rule of radio and accepting bribes to play records that may not otherwise make it to air – not completely unbelievable, and <em>highly</em> illegal. What should have been a war of words with Esco himself turned into an assault charge as Flex confronted and laid hands on <a href=\"http://www.hiphopdx.com/index/news/id.1222/title.funk-flex-assaults-steph-lova\">Steph Lova the next day</a>.\n\n<strong>Flex vs 2Pac Fans</strong>\n\nThere is one thing that hip-hop fans, depending on their personal taste, can never agree on: Biggie vs Tupac. So it's understandable that Flex rubbed some heads the wrong way (pause) when he proclaimed live on stage that he didn't feel as though he needed to suck and/or ride 2Pac's penis like most fans – rather, as a New Yorker his horse in the race was the late Biggie Smalls. Wow, just wow. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lMa62N2XarM\">Watch that footage here</a>.\n\n<hr />\n\nMoral of the story is that Flex is opinionated and really has<em> zero fucks</em> to give about your opinion. With over 20 years in the game, maybe he's earned the right – it certainly does make for good radio!\n\n<iframe src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/4TRsOt8lIdU\" width=\"420\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe>\n\n<iframe src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/wuqiFmPsqBo\" width=\"420\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe>",

    "content_html": "January 20th was a big day – and not just because it was my birthday. While a lot of heads were busy checking for the new Lupe and Joey Bada$$ albums, I was checking for my pre-order of that new Sadat X album. Was it worth the wait? In short, yes. The aptly titled <em>Never Left</em>, which is X's 10 solo album, serves as a salute to the city of New York, a pound to real heads and a testament to his 25 year legacy.\n\nThe album kicks off with <em>We In New York City</em>, an ode to his hometown. If you've never been there this track may not appeal you, but that's ok. It's not really for you. For some of you instantly alienated listeners the album actually begins with track 3, <em>I Know This Game</em>, where Sadat X puts the game on blast, and discusses the state of the industry, namely the degradation of the power that record labels once held.\n<blockquote>\"I know some A&R's that now wash cars, they decided rap stars when they was in power...\nSony fired everybody, everybody sour...now rap moguls gotta blend with the locals...\"\nSadat X</blockquote>\nAs we continue along, we come to <em>What Up Kid</em>, which is essentially cautionary words of advice to the younger generation – much like Slick Rick's <em>Hey Young World</em>. This is one of the more serious notes on the album, as is <em>Ya Live & Ya Learn</em>, which sees X discussing his past legal and marital issues: <em>\"...when I went o jail I lost my wife...on that particular day I had the gun, wasn't plannin' on killing no one, I had a street beef...\"</em>\n\nAre there features, yes! Are they crutches? Nope. They are prefect compliments to the vibe. The album (most notably to me) has 16's from Black Rob (<em>Get Yours</em>), west coast legend King T (<em>Sliddin</em>'), Blacksheep/Evitan's Dres (<em>Get Right</em>) and Cormega on the already released single <em>On Fire</em>. Also, one of my fave moments on the album, <em>Ain't Nothin Funny</em>, features Craig G and Skyzoo.\n\nThe only misstep for me was the Fokus, Nasty Ness and Chi Ali assisted <em>Put It On Me</em>. I found the reggae flow really out of place on this album.\n\nOverall it's an amazing listen. A great addition was the mini story/interludes where he talks about his first show, his legendary session with B.I.G, meeting Jay-Z, seeing Nas at his shows and his relationship with 2Pac. Aside from giving rap nerds something to talk about, they really help illustrate the influence and respect Sadat has amongst his peers in the music racket.\n\nThe album ends with the title cut, which is fitting. Rap changed, times changed, but Sadat never changed his style or ideology for the industry. He <em>never</em> left!\n\n<iframe src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/Za71LstD0OA\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe>",

    "content_html": "I'm a junky for original versions. It's not often that you find a classic hip-hop record that didn't have an alternate version – for a multitude of reasons. It could be that once they had money they could afford better production to spruce the track up. It could be a matter of sample clearance, like Kanye's <em>All Falls Down</em> that originally featured a Lauren Hill sample; however, more often than not, the original just wasn't hitting,  so once signed, the label took the steps necessary to make the track sound its best. This week we look at three originals and judge for ourselves.\n\n<strong>Camp-Lo - <em>Coolie High</em></strong>\n\nCamp-Lo's Uptown Saturday Night was a sleeper hit – a musical cult-classic of you will. Led by the infamous single <em>Luchini</em>, the duo came out the gate with a classic. Unfortunately (from a commercial standpoint) the duo faded fast, and although they've released music since, they never again reached <em>Luchini</em> heights. The song <em>Coolie High</em> was considered by many to be one of the dopest tracks on the album, and had they somehow gotten away with the sample of the original, they would have made a larger impact in my opinion. Take a listen for yourself.\n\n<iframe width=\"640\" height=\"360\" src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/1pA4F356ln4?list=PL0122488C9DD39C21\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\n<strong>Artifacts - <em>Wrong Side Of The Tracks</em></strong>\n\nNewark's own Artifacts, the duo of El Da Sensei and Tame One, have one of the dopest hip-hop classics ever – in fact it's one of my top 10 tracks ever in music. The demo version, however, is a whole different beast. It has a slight funk to it, and the infamous hook is sang by Brand Nubian rapper (and Vlad TV staple) Lord Jamar. We think they made the right choice in the end. Take a listen to the demo version for yourself.\n\n<iframe width=\"640\" height=\"360\" src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/STXLqI7H4GE?list=PL0122488C9DD39C21\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\n<strong>Pete Rock CL Smooth - <em>T.R.O.Y </em></strong>\n\nThis is it folks, possibly the greatest sample ever in hip-hop!

    "content_html": "Product placements are nothing new, especially in hip-hop. Heads like myself often like to gripe about how commercial things have gotten, but we often overlook the overt, almost insulting product placements of the 90's. This week we'll chat about St.Ides – that's right, malt liquor. 40's were a staple in pretty much every hip-hop video of the 90's, and most of your fave artists were being paid to swig various flavours of the infamous crooked I. \n\n<blockquote>Timberland boot-wearing urban icons smoking blunt warps were nothing more than walking billboards.</blockquote>\n\nIt wasn't a low-budget affair either – St.Ides had rap royalty on the payroll. We're talking Tupac, Snoop, Dre, Ice Cube, Mc Eiht, Geto Boyz, Nate Dogg (RIP), Warren G and more. I know what you're thinking, and no, not only west coast rappers were getting paid by crooked I. Wu-Tang Clan, Biggie Smalls and Rakim also got in on the action. At least you can say that St.Ides did their homework. \n\nLooking at it with hindsight, these commercials, although nostalgic are kind of sad. Hip-hop is a business (I realize), but as someone who used to look up to these greats, it's disheartening to realize the lifestyle you (once) strived to live up to was largely commercially influenced. Timberland boot-wearing urban icons smoking blunt warps were nothing more than walking billboards for brands scheming to reach a demographic they likely understood better than we perceived they did. \n\n<em>Oh well!</em>\n\nThat's business though, and the more things change, the more they stay the same. Check out a playlist of some of the best St.Ides joints – we recommend the Wh-Tang Clan one, the beat is crazy dope! \n\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/19cjIAK_w1Q?list=PL99247A83D20CF46F\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>",

His debut album <em>Paid In Full</em> was named the greatest hip-hop album of all time by MTV in 2006, and his name comes up in any and every top 5 list. He's pretty much your favourite rappers favourite rapper. I had the opportunity to meet Rakim back in 2007 at Harbourfront Centre in Toronto – and it still stands as one of the best concerts I've ever seen. \n\nSo today we salute the microphone fiend – Happy Birthday Ra!",

    "content_html": "<p class=\"p1\">20 years ago, The Source Magazine's Nicholas Poluhoff proclaimed Chef Raekwon's debut album one of the best rap LPs of the year (if not ever). 20 years later and, much like the music itself, that review still holds truth. <em>Only Built 4 Cuban Linx</em> (OBFCL), the third solo effort to drop from the mighty WU-Tang Clan, is rightfully harolded by many as the quintessential street hip-hop album.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Although it initially failed to commercially match the success of the group debut, Meth's <em>Tical</em> and ODB's <em>Return To The 36 Chambers</em>, it's definitely stood the test of time – much in the same fashion that Illmatic has [note: it has long since been certified as platinum]. I defy you to not get open when you hear <em>Ice Cream</em>, because twenty years later it still knocks harder than 80% of the joints out there.</span></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">\"What truly sets <em>Cuban Linx</em> apart is the abundance of well-written complex lyrics. The end result is one of the best rap LPs of the year (if not ever)...\"</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">–Nicholas Poluhoff, Source Magazine (1995)</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">[4.5 Mics]</span></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">More importantly, Cuban Linx has inspired a generation of emcees (myself included) and producers. The album's narrative, lyricism, beats, features and even artwork were almost godly, and raised an outlandish bar of perfection that even Chef himself has never truly been able to surmount; although, OBFCL 2 was an amazing effort. It's a timeless artifact that takes listeners on a walk through the (dirty) streets of NYC circa 1995 – we're talking crime, Lo Snow Beach jackets, Tommy Hill, Clarks and blunts. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">In celebration of the album's upcoming 20 year anniversary this summer, Rae and Ghost announced an upcoming documentary called <em>The Purple Tape Files</em>. The trailer, which debuted this past weekend at Sundance, is an exciting look at what appears to be a candid recount of the making of the classic. Hip-hop nerds, let's collectively rejoice.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">We asked our Twitter followers if the album had inspired them in their lives/careers, and here's what some of them had to say:</p>\n<em>#onlybuiltforcubanlinx Helped me assimilate my style as an artist.</em>\n– <a href=\"http://www.twitter.com/DrkSideFlow\">@DrkSideFlow</a>\n\n<em>Told Rea days ago! This album was our Theme music in the 90's!!! A major reason why the Crown came back to NYC!</em>\n– <a href=\"http://www.twitter.com/1KING_1CROWN\">@1KING_1CROWN</a>\n\n<em>Cuban Linx's a soundtrack to my life as an inner city kid. It was Walkman food. I studied it like a textbook.</em>\n– <a href=\"http://www.twitter.com/MrBenFamous\">@MrBenFamous</a>\n\n<em>Of course (I've been inspired by it). Since the Operation Push Concert in '95.

    "content_html": "I get a lot of mixes from DJs in my inbox – like lots! Every once and a while though, you hear something that stands out from the pack. That's what happened last Friday afternoon when I came across an insane mix of Camp Lo's Luchini blended with Bobby Shmurda's <em>Hot Nigga</em>. I dug deeper into the catalogue of James \"Biko\" Gates aka Nappy DJ Needles – the creator of the blend – and discovered a ton of dope material. He's definitely worth checking out.\n\nGet to know a little more about Nappy DJ Needles in the interview below.\n\n<hr></hr>\n\n<strong>Introduce yourself.</strong>\n\nI'm Nappy DJ Needles from St. Louis.\n\n<strong>How did you get into DJing?</strong>\n\nI was asked by my brother to do a birthday party for one of his friends back in 1994. All I had was tapes and a few cds to play out of a boombox but I made it work. The response I got from playing my personal selections was infectious so I kept at it. During that time I was always shook that some kid was gonna call me out for not being a \"real\" dj since I was only working with tapes, so before that ever happend, after a few years, I got a cheap mixer and mis-matched turntables and learned to mix records. In 1998, I deejayed live with vinyl for the first time and it's been on ever since.\n\n<strong>Who were some of your influences?</strong>\n\nMy influences include Jazzy Jeff, Rich Medina, G-Wiz, DJ Alejan and Kid Capri.\n\n<strong>Vinyl or Serato?</strong>\n\nBoth, but I'm a digger so vinyl will always trump Serato.\n\n<strong>What is your fave albums in your collection?</strong>\n\nI have so many favorites I wouldn't know where to begin!\n\n<strong>What tracks are you currently playing?</strong>\n\nKaytranada feat. Vic Mensa <em>Drive Me Crazy</em>, BJ The Chicago Kid feat. ScHoolBoy Q <em>It's True</em>, Meek Mill <em>Ice Cream Freestyle</em>, Joey Bada$$ <em>No 99</em>.\n\n<strong>How do you approach a mash-up?</strong>\n\nIt's a pretty simple process to me. Most times the idea to mix an acapella over a particular beat will come as I'm deejayin live. I'll have the track going first then I'll grab the acapella and try it out in the cue. If everything pans out, I'll run it right then. If it hits me a certain way, that's when I decide whether or not to formerly make an official blend out of it in the lab.\n\n<strong>Can you tell us about your projects?</strong>\n\nI've been doing mixtapes (real mixtapes) since 1998. From Undreground Hip-Hop to indie soul, I was putting them out constantly. I started doing the blend projects in 2008. The first one was entitled <em>American Gangstarr</em> where I put Jay Z's <em>American Gangster</em> lyrics over beats by Gang Starr. In 2012, I put out <em>Blends</em> featuring mix-ups of Whitney Houston and Thundercat, Mary Mary and Run-DMC, The Beastie Boys and Tyler, The Creator, Adele and Mr. Cheeks, etc. The last 2 I did were <em>A Tribe Called Kast</em> (Outkast over ATCQ) in 2013 and <em>The Notorious Exchange</em> (B.I.G. over The Foreign Exchange) in 2014.\n\n<strong>How can people find you?</strong>\n\nPeople can find me on facebook (Nappy DJ Needles or James Biko), twitter and instagram (@nappydjneedles), soundcloud.com/nappydjneedles, mixcloud.com/djneedles and check out my projects at ghettoblastic.bandcamp.com\n\n<strong>Any last words?</strong>\n\nThanks for listening...stay tuned for more\n\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/UhrGENh4YHk\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\n<hr></hr>\n\nHere are some places to check out some of Nappy DJ Needles.\n\nhttp://www.twitter.com/nappydjneedles\nhttp://www.facebook.com/nappydjneedles\nhttp://www.ghettoblastic.bandcamp.com\nhttp://www.ghettoblastic.com\nhttp://www.allpropsdeserved.com",

    "content_html": "I've been known to shower Your Old Droog with praise – in fact he was one of my <a title=\"Special’s Top 5 of 2014: #5 Your Old Droog\" href=\"http://aboveaveragehiphop.com/specials-top-5-2014-5-old-droog/\">top 5 of 2014</a>; although, it's hard to argue the opposite. It's not often in today's landscape that a white rapper isn't even acknowledged by critics as a white rapper. Maybe that's because he isn't part of the problem in today's hip-hop culture. If anything he's a trailblazer who's helping to steer our ship towards the promised land it was once on course for. Much like Action Bronson, his ora seems authentic, making his appeal less forced than some of his peers.\n<blockquote>Back in the line of fire – saying my style is dated is like is checking to see if wine expires.\n\n– Your Old Droog from the song <em>Porno For Pyros</em></blockquote>\nTrue to his out of nowhere approach, the once faceless (Nas-ish sounding) Droog dropped his latest EP yesterday called <em>Kinison</em>, much to my joy. While his first album was full of gritty jazz, soul and funk samples – tamed by DJ Skizz – this latest effort contains a cornucopia of rock nods; however, this album is (sonically) all hip-hop sans the 90's rock references sprinkled throughout.\n\nDroog expands his production team slightly as El RMTC and Marco Polo help Skizz with heavy lifting this time around. This album is full of bangers. Standouts for me were the Skizz produced <em>Porno For Pyros</em>, which I recognized from his <a href=\"hhttp://youtu.be/CZZO9EueT4s?t=2m29s\">Sway appearance</a>, <em>Gentrify My Hood</em>, in which Droog discusses CI's (apparent) lack of amenities and lastly the Marco Polo produced <em>Sonic Youth</em>. Understand me though, that's subjective, because tracks like <em>Blood</em> and <em>Homicide</em> will have you breaking rewind buttons. There is literally no filler.\n\nHe's more than a similar voice. Droog stays true to himself, and once again puts together a cohesive project that ignores conventions (set by radio and mass media). This album seems slightly more approachable for some reason – I'm struggling to fully put my finger on it – which may make him slightly easier for some to digest. With an upcoming tour with PRhyme 2015 is looking like a good year for CI's finest.\n\nGet familiar.\n\n<iframe src=\"http://www.audiomack.com/embed4-album/your-old-droog/kinison-ep\" width=\"100%\" height=\"350\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe>",

    "content_html": "The Mood Doctors, more commonly known as The MD's, are a Long Island based hip-hop group that consists of Lucious \"Luck\" Mercer, Neal \"Purp\" Forrester, Savander \"Van\" Parker a.k.a. Grippy Grip and DJ Evil Dee – one half of the Beatminerz and 1/3 of the legendary NYC group Black Moon. The group's founding members, Bronx-born Luck (who is the brother of De La Soul member Posdnous) and Jamaican born Purp, are life long friends. Together they have over 20 years in the game – and listening to their latest EP, <em>Containment</em>, it definitely shows.\n\n<blockquote>\"Just because you wrote a song, don't make it a record, no disrespect kid, tighten up your crew and get connected...\"<br> – from the song <em>Refuse</em></blockquote>\n\nThe album is both reflective of the NYC underground sound, and collective industry experience – both of which are prominently displayed throughout the entire 6 song project. The MDs flip through different styles like the boom bap sounds of the self-produced tracks <em>Refuse</em> (currently getting burn on Beatminerz Radio) and <em>Time Refill</em>, which tackle topics ranging from the industry and NYC life to social/political issues. The project is light on features, in fact there is only two: Likwuid knocking <em>Take Me To The Mardi Gras</em> sampled <em>Ayo A Yo</em> and Marlem on the slower neo-soul-vibed bonus joint <em>Thirsty</em>.\n\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"450\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/184382104&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true\"></iframe>\n\nAlthough there is no direct Beatminerz production on this album, Evil Dee provides all the cuts, and a cohesive mix of the entire EP. He’s the man behind the iconic <em>How Many MC’s</em> cuts – so you know he comes correct.\n\nThe album is refreshing – but it’s not for everyone, and not for the radio. It’s for real heads, and it’s disappointing to know that projects of this caliber may never get the mainstream attention they deserve. That’s not the fault of the artist, or even necessarily the listeners; however, that’s a whole other topic. It’s a great listen though, and I highly recommend it.",

It's hard to say; if everyone knew the answer there would be hundreds of illmatic albums on shelves. Golden era produced a lot of timeless songs – like Raekwon's <em>Ice Cream</em>, Camp Lo's <em>Luchini</em>, <em>Nine's Watcha Want</em>. Basically records every DJ has in his crate, ready to drop at any party. Not many (90's) rappers can claim such a record. Blahzay Martell is one of the ones who can. In the 90's, as one half of the group Blahzay Blahzay with DJ PF Cuttin, he released the album <em>Blah Blah Blah</em>, which contained the godly, chart topping single <em>Danger</em>.\n\nBlahz has had an interesting career to say the least – from an unspoken role in the East-coast west-coast beef and a (professional) relationship with Biggie Smalls to performing around the world. He's continued to make (incredibly banging) music, and is about to unveil his latest song and video <em>Wake Up/No More Sleeping</em>. In fact, we're the first ones to post it – give it a spin below.\n\n<iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/VTcHQgdX0G8?rel=0\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe>\n\nBlahzay Martell was kind enough to chat with me about his career, his music and his new <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/blahzaymartell\">video podcast</a>. Check out our conversation below.\n\n<hr />\n\n<strong>Introduce yourself to our readers.</strong>\n\nBlahz Martell of Blahzay Blahzay.\n\n<strong>How did you get involved in hip-hop?</strong>\n\nMy older brother and sister was into Hiphop..sheepskins and rope chains and my father made gospel music.\n\n<strong>Who were some of your influences coming up in the game?</strong>\n\nThere where a lot of artists that influenced me growing up. All of that music from the late 80's early 90's. My problem was, when you meet the artist your perspective change a lot and I met a lot of artists growing up in Brooklyn. But Guru and Premo of GANGSTARR became real unique in my influences, because they were exactly the same people in real life they were on their records.\n\n<strong>Talk about the breakout hit Danger.</strong>\n\nEverybody in NYC was popping off at the time except EAST NEW YORK, so we was trying to make a anthem for our hood.\n\n<strong>Did you know that it would be a hit?</strong>\n\nI knew everybody around my way would love it, but not so many people around the world.\n\n<strong>Was it your favourite track on \"Blah Blah Blah\"? If not, what was?</strong>\n\nMy favorite is <em><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCSgKTiVk30&list=PLA458D6F3C1BE1F36&index=7\">GOOD COP BAD COP</a></em> because of the story. I think everybody loves a good story.\n\n<strong>Can you share any of your most memorable moments from that period in your career?</strong>\n\nPerforming and getting love in places in Europe where people never met black people or even Americans.\n\n<strong>Can you tell us about your relationship with Notorious B.I.G?</strong>\n\nWe was both managed by Dj Mister Cee, and was a part of that original entourage that travelled with Big, breaking his music.\n\n<strong>There was never an official 2nd (album) release for Blahzay Blahzay – can you share why not?</strong>\n\nOne of the major reasons was the record industry flip flopping on us after Biggie and Tupac was murdered. Everyone ran far away from the East Coast vs West Coast campaign .The record that brought us to international recognition was later getting me black balled and Mercury closed their black music department.\n\n<strong>What are some of things (musically) you've worked on since that period?</strong>\n\nHellz yeah a lot of music, but one of the biggest things I'm proud of is being a part of bringing Hip Hop to the East again, Far East, to Thailand with the hip hop group THAITANIUM.\n\n<strong>Do you still work with PF?</strong>\n\nOh yeah he's a major part of the present production in a lot of different ways .

    "content_html": "<blockquote>\"My history with Kanye is I didn't respect him as a rapper because I was around the greatest rappers....but he has courage.\" <br>\n—Dame Dash</blockquote>\n\n<em>Business Never Personal</em> was the ironic title of the pre-breakup album by EPMD. Amidst rumours that PMD was withholding monies and Erick paid goons to rob Parrish Smith's home, the crew broke up indefinitely. Fortunately for fans that <em>indefinitely</em> turned out to only be 3 years. This is just one of many hip-hop breakups that we've all had to collective go through – think Fugees, Geto Boys, etc.\n\nHowever, no break-up can truely top the Roc-A-Fella team. No need to fully elaborate on the widely public circumstances, but like many divorces, <em>the children</em> were the casualties. It was this splitting of allegiances that ended up causing further rifts and, eventually, ended an era. Most notably Kanye West, whom Dame is credited as first signing, followed Jay. Outspoken Dame was understandably upset.\n\nIt wasn't until recently that the duo reunited. Dame was on hand to present Kanye with an award at the Hip-Hop Honours, and if a picture is worth a thousand words, then Dame's smile as he took a selfie with Yeezus and his daughter could write a book. As Dame made clear – his issues were more than business, this was emotional. It was obvious this reunion meant a lot to him.\n\nToday we received more news on Dame and Kanye – they are about to launch a new business venture. They are starting a film company, which is fitting considering Dame's experience and Kanye's apparent interest in short films. It's an exciting new venture, and I'm curious to see how it rolls out.\n\nHere is what Dame had to say about the situation:\n\n<em>“The thing we don’t do historically and culturally is stick together but we are stopping that now if we stick together we don’t need any middle men from others cultures… We know we can do it on our own…but we are so powerful together…pause and we have our own money..we already made history in music so we can do that for fun so we’re gonna do movies… This is like when Spielberg and Geffen got together and did dreamworks…it’s time…me and kanye making movies and my brother Qtip was there to bless the deal.”</em>\n\nCongratulations to these two brothers on their new endeavour – and for putting the pettiness aside. This is a win for hip-hop.",

    "content_html": "<blockquote>“All I know is if the Grammys want real artists to keep coming back, they need to stop playing with us...”\n\n–Kanye</blockquote>\nBeck beat Beyoncé – and it seemed as though Kanye was going to storm the stage à la Taylor Swift. Instead, he spun it into one of the best memes of the year (thus far). It was later though, while he was taking to E! that he <a href=\"http://youtu.be/E95bOqOIkjM\">dropped a great nugget</a>. Sure, crazy old Kanye was ranting again, but look past that.\n\nKanye is right, we have to fight for art and creativity. The issue that the average (media) consumer may have is that comparing Beyoncé and Beck is difficult, as they're different genres, demographic (and so on). But face it, award shows do have a tendency to shit on creativity and award (often) mediocracy; however, I'm not saying Beck was mediocre <em>at all.</em> The choice of winner has often proven to not be based on album sales alone, which leaves the final decisions in the hands of a shadowy jury who choose songs based on, well... [should shrug].\n\nKanye's rant during the Taylor Swift award was shaky – <em>Single Ladies</em> was cool, but greatest of all-time? Let's just say that was the Hennessy talking. But this time around his rant checks out. Beyoncé's was so incredibly ambitious, large in scale and visually/creatively amazing. It was the fastest selling album in I-Tunes history, and has sold well over 5 million copies. How did it not win?\n\nAt some point award shows and awarding bodies need to stop making choices motivated by, well, I'm not exactly sure. Money? I mean even Eminem (no disrespect) probably didn't deserve to win an award with that lifeless reboot of <em>The Marshall Mathers LP</em>.\n\nTo play devil's advocate, creativity can be subjective – but it's hard to ignore that creativity is rarely awarded. At some point real artists will stop caring. When the biggest platforms, which arguably influence sales and trends, stop giving a shit, how long before artists start to do the same? As Kanye stated, \"If the Grammys want real artists to keep coming back, they need to stop playing with us...”\n\n<iframe width=\"420\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/E95bOqOIkjM\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>",

I was up early after a (very) long night. I was walking towards York University's student centre to meet up with an independent CD seller who was known to often sell new [retail] albums ahead their scheduled release. This particular morning I was on a mission to pick up the debut album from a young brother by the name of Kanye West, <em>The College Dropout</em>.\n\nAfter getting my hands on the album, and \n\"getting right\", I made my way to the library to give it a listen. It was an experience that's hard to explain. Something I'd only felt a few times – like when I first heard <em>Illmatic</em> or <em>Slim Shady LP</em>. You just knew that this guy was going to be a <em>very</em> big deal. The album was brilliant. \n\nIn an era when rappers wore throwbacks and spit about street shit and macho bravado (not that much has changed), Ye was spitting about hating his job at the Gap, dropping out of school, finding Jesus, and recounting his near fatal accident. It was refreshing, articulate, original – an instant classic. It challenged conventions and made Kanye the star he is today. It's astounding to reflect on the progression he's had as an artist. From this (literal) backpack rap to <em>Yeezus</em>, It's almost comical to think that people actually didn't buy into Kanye originally. As Pharrell notes in his original EPK, <em>\"I didn't know\"!</em>. \n\nToday the album turns 11 – and I'm spending my evening knocking it in the whip and reminiscing about a simpler time in my life. Funny how music can do that to you.\n\n<iframe width=\"420\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Fcl7umGo2hA\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n<p>\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/videoseries?list=PLc70fg9UHuOwdc55E44EmZf7ygfRT_N9p\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>",

    "content_html": "<blockquote><em>\"We want everybody to be excited about getting some good Hip Hop first and foremost.\"</em>\n\nMarq Beyond of Rosewood 2055</blockquote>\nDon’t sleep on the opening act! Admittedly, the first time I came upon Rosewood 2055, formally The Action Figures, was this past weekend when I stumble upon the latest joint by Slum Village,<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xCac5jyS-nM\"><em> E(I)GO</em></a>. After a little research, I discovered that the duo have been touring the world with the Detroit-bred institution (that originally counted <a title=\"Happy Dilla Day\" href=\"http://aboveaveragehiphop.com/happy-dilla-day/\">Dilla</a> as part of their roster) and have worked with the likes of <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B9xp-sw6Hk\">Guilty Simpson</a> and Statik Selecktah (amongst others). What was even more surprising, was that their upcoming <em>Top Ramen</em> is their debut mix-tape (sans some singles).\n\nThey have a journey ahead of them, but their current team and show dates have them primed to make some serious noise this year. I reached out to Marq Beyond, on half of Rosewood, to learn a little more about the duo.\n\n<hr>\n\n<strong>Who are Rosewood 2055?</strong>\n\nKysean and Marq Beyond. Two kids from Grand Rapids, MI.\n\n<strong>How did you come together – and what prompted your name change?</strong>\n\nWe met in High School, I had a crew I ran with and was known for being the rapper. Ky and I were cool, but I didnt get to know him til later and I was blown away by how passionate and knowledgeable he was on Hip Hop and the culture. We just clicked. The Action Figures grew to be bigger than both of us and it's more of an ideal and way of life. So TAF is Wu Tang and Rosewood 2055 is Rae and Ghost. 2055 Rosewood Ave is the address of the High School we went to.\n\n<strong>Who were/are some of your influences?</strong>\n\nThe culture in general is what influences us most. What it means and stands for. Everyone who's contributed to the culture included.\n\n<strong>How do you define your sound?</strong>\n\nI wouldn't say there's any definitive sound. We both have our own ideas for songs and music and we bring the best of what we have and meet in the middle. The only thing we never, ever compromise is lyricism. So as long as we're free to say what we like, how we like, its a 20's record.\n\n<strong>Who are some of the artists you've worked with?</strong>\n\nWe've worked with Lee Bannon, Chuck Strangers, Rapper Big Pooh, Guilty Simpson, Statik Selektah, Illmind, Earlly Mac etc. We like to work with a variety of different artists, to pull from different avenues of inspiration and creativity. We got a few surprises coming soon as well.\n\n<strong>How did you connect with Slum Village?</strong>\n\nOur management has had a close relationship with them for awhile. We sent them some music and they asked us to come out. We all ended up clicking, and they're like our big brothers now.\n\n<strong>How has working with them helped to shape you as artists?</strong>\n\n<strong>\n</strong>\n\nIt definitely changed the way we work. They work so fast and move even faster, so it was either keep up or get left behind. They made us rededicate ourselves to the craft too! We've spent days at a time locked in the studio. The shortest session was probably 10 hours. We know now, that its work and you get back what you put in.\n\n<strong>How's the tour life?</strong>\n\nTouring is dope as hell man. Thats the part we've always wanted most. Being in a new city, connecting. Its can be hectic, with schedules to keep but its worth the early hours. For sure.\n\n<strong>What was your fave show so far?</strong>\n\nNew York cause it was the very first night, or Milan, Italy.\n\n<strong>It's astounding that you haven't even released your debut yet! What can we expect from <em>Top Ramen</em>?</strong>\n\nJust expect good Hip Hop lol. We want everybody to be excited about getting some good Hip Hop first and foremost.\n\n<strong>What are your goals?</strong>\n\nThe goal is to keep growing, and keep moving as a unit. With that in mind, we hope to get to a Slum Status one day.\n\n<strong>Think quick: top 3 albums – go!</strong>\n\n<em>Thriller</em>\n<em> Reasonable Doubt</em>\n<em> Late Registration</em>\n\n<strong>Any last words for our readers?</strong>\n\nThank you for having us. Catch us @ rosewood2055.com and on select dates of the Slum Village/ Pete Rock tour. <em>Top Ramen</em> and <em>Yes!</em> Coming soon.\n\n<hr>\n\n<iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/X8QR5xplPvc\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h1>UPDATE</h1>\nPeer their latest single!\n\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"450\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/191585194&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true\"></iframe>",

Callis' sound mirrors that of the late 90's Common Sense or Slum Village, with his own added flavor thrown in. That is what's truly given him an advantage over many of the artists that surround him.

His name and Tumblr have been popping up all over the web on sites like Complex, which instantly caught my attention. His hip-hop portraits have received nods from the likes of Rick Ross, Big Sean and Joey Bada$$. Back at home, his work has been displayed at Brisfest, and exhibited at Philadelphia Street Gallery in Cabot Circus – he even has another exhibit opening up next week. Also, Bristol-based <em>Rife Magazine</em> recently featured him in their 24 under 24 list, and I don't blame them honestly.\n\nHe's a super talented kid, and I decided to reach out to him for a quick Q&A. Get to know a little more about Just Scribble in the interview below.\n\n[gallery columns=\"4\" link=\"file\" ids=\"1185,1184,1180,1181\"]\n\n<hr />\n\n<strong>Introduce yourself.</strong>\n\nI’m ‘Just Scribble’, a self taught artist from the UK.\n\n<strong>How did you get into art?</strong>\n\nDrawing is something I’ve been doing since the age of 2. I continued to do it throughout my childhood, so there wasn’t any real moment I got into Art; it just naturally found me.\n\n<strong>Can you tell us about the work you have on your Tumblr?</strong>\n\nThe work I have on my tumblr is a collection of drawings/paintings, mainly of Hip-Hop artists that have inspired me over the years.\n\n<strong>Do you exhibit it?</strong>\n\nYeah, I’ve had my work exhibited in two galleries so far. I’ve got another exhibition coming up this weekend.\n\n<strong>Who was the first rapper to take notice of your work?</strong>\n\nThe first major rapper to take notice of my work was Rick Ross. I was fairly new to twitter at the time, so I was just tweeting a bunch of my pieces on there. I posted a drawing I did of Rick Ross, not expecting him to see it. The next thing I knew, he retweeted the drawing and followed me.\n\n<strong>What was that like?</strong>\n\nThat was a big moment for me. From then on I began seeking the attention of bigger names within the Hip-Hop industry.\n\n<strong>What are you currently working on now?</strong>\n\nI’m not working on anything at the moment. I only work when I’m inspired to create something, so right now I’m taking a break until I get hit with some inspiration.\n\n<strong>What are your fave hip-hop albums right now?</strong>\n\nI don’t have any current favourites in terms of albums right now. A lot of what’s come out recently is good, but not mind blowing. My favourite mixtape at the moment is Mick Jenkins – The Water[s]. That tape is deep.\n\n<strong>Where can people see more of your work – and can they purchase it?</strong>\n\nFor more of my work, you can check out my website: http://www.justscribbleart.com\n\nYou can also purchase prints of my work from The Fifth Wall website -http://www.thefifthwall.co.uk/shop/index.php/artists/justscribble.html\n\n<strong>Anything else you'd like to share with our readers.</strong>\n\nI would just like to thank everybody who’s been supporting & encouraging me in my art career so far.\n\n \n\n<a href=\"http://aboveaveragehiphop.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/tumblr_nfrz6soAYV1qgngudo1_1280.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-1183\" src=\"http://aboveaveragehiphop.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/tumblr_nfrz6soAYV1qgngudo1_1280-1024x863.jpg\" alt=\"tumblr_nfrz6soAYV1qgngudo1_1280\" width=\"620\" height=\"522\" /></a>",

    "content_html": "<blockquote>\n<p class=\"p1\">This album has absolutely no filler – and flows coherently from cover to cover. It's intricate, down to the last detail, atmospheric and full of depth.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p class=\"p1\">There's something to be said for live instrumentation, or rather, using actual musicians to record live music. It's a practice that was often reserved for (some) live performances and platforms like SNL and Jimmy Fallon; however, with exception of a few groups, namely The Roots, there has historically been a severe lack of Hip-Hop bands. It's actually perplexing, when you stop to consider the amount of live instrumentation that has actually gone into the work of some of the most iconic producers of our day. That's beginning to change though, and over the past few years there has been a rise in live hip-hop. Some notable collborations that I personally enjoyed were <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jl-T7RPUT6M\">Elzhi and Will Sessions</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmpg0zytiAg\">Cormega and The Revelations</a>. Today though, I have a new favourite. Ghostface Killah and GOODGOODNOTBAD have unleashed their jazzy new project <em>Sour Soul</em> on the people – and it's marvellous.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Argue that Ghostface Killah isn't one one of the hardest working cats in the game today. Pro tip: you can't. Fresh off of <em>36 seasons</em>, which was one of my <a title=\"Special’s Top 5 of 2014: #4 Ghostface Killah\" href=\"http://aboveaveragehiphop.com/specials-top-5-2014-4-ghostface-killah/\">favourite albums of 2014</a>, the great Ghostini is back in effect, this time collaborating with Toronto-based hip-hop/jazz outfit BADBADNOTGOOD (BBNG). If you're not familiar with that name, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o7PEnj-8NHw\"><span class=\"s2\">they’ve collaborated with Tyler, The Creator</span></a> on multiple occasions, opened for <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M36OGCfYp3A\"><span class=\"s2\">Roy Ayers</span></a>, and backed <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NoxNmh7LVHg\"><span class=\"s2\">Frank Ocean</span></a> at the 2012 Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival as band-in-residence. They've also produced for Earl Sweatshirt and Danny Brown.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">This album is first, and foremost, a true collaboration. It's just as much a showcase of the trio's musical ability as it is a showcase of Ghostface's infinite potential to drop bars, on bars, on bars (and so on). In fact, GFK even sits a few of the tracks out, letting the guys shine. Tracks like <em>Mono</em>, <em>Stark's Reality</em> and <em>Experience</em> add mood and character to the album, as do extra long outros and transitions. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">There are a few guest 16's on this album, including Elzhi on the heavy hitting <em>Gunshowers</em>, Danny Brown on <em>Six Degrees,</em> and the ever elusive – and always dope – MF Doom on <em>Raygun</em>. A standout for me was the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6QUG382k7HU\">Wet Willie</a>-tinged <em>Street Knowledge</em> featuring Tree. </span>This album has absolutely no filler – and flows coherently from cover to cover. It's intricate, down to the last detail, atmospheric and full of depth. Ghostface gives the listener jewels that range from the overbearing nature of the alphabet boys on <em>Sour Soul,</em> to some overwhelming positivity on the aptly titled <em>Nuggets Of Wisdom</em>.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">This album is a breath of fresh air, and is sure to inspire many MC's to work with live musicians for their next project. Oh and if anyone in the game STILL isn't up on BBNG, they are about to be – in a major way.</span></p>\n<iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/6YW_RqTuZMw\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe>\n\n<hr />\n\n<iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/playlists/82739678&color=ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false\" width=\"100%\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"no\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe>",

    "content_html": "<blockquote>\"Few rap albums of the modern era have the pure testicular quality of Jealous One's Envy...\"\n\n– AllMusic</blockquote>\nThe biggest problem with being a (major) hip-hop head, is that sometimes you end up in conversations with others, and you have to find a way not to come off as a know-it-all. I wish I could explain how many times I’ve heard the South Bronx rapper Fat Joe described as being discovered by Big Pun. It’s like looking at a crooked picture if you have OCD. It's maddening. I want to slap them and explain that Joe has been around for like <strong>EVER</strong>, and was an amazing, non-commercially motivated hip-hop architect during the golden era.\n\nSo here I go – let's all go back to 1993.\n\nI thought i’d share a bit about the Fat Joe that most heads either don’t know, or don’t acknowledge (anymore). Fat Joe was originally a member of the DITC crew, meaning he rolled with the likes of Diamond D, Showbiz & AG, Lord Finesse, and the late-great Big L. He was vicious on the mic, and in 1993 on the Relativity Records imprint he dropped his debut solo album, <em>Represent</em>. It was dope. It featured production from his DITC brethren, as well as hip-hop mainstays like the Beatnuts. The album spurred the iconic single <em>Flow Joe</em>, and the far less talked about <em>Watch The Sound</em> featuring Grand Puba and Diamond D. Keep in mind, this is 1993, so names like Puba and Diamond were a big  deal. The album also had verses from Apache and Kool G Rap. It also featured the original version of his classic <em>The Shit Is Real</em>. Critics didn’t hate it.\n\nThen Joe dropped his second album, <em>Jealous Ones Envy</em>, which i’ll preface by saying is one of those albums that just hit me the right way when it dropped. It was the soundtrack to my life. Let’s point out the goods: <em>The Shit’s Real</em>, and <em>Success</em> –both produced by DJ Premier. <em>Respect Mine</em> featuring Raekwon, <em>Bronx Tale</em> featuring KRS-ONE. The album is so gritty, so NYC, and just so hip-hop. the production is absolutely gorgeous.\n\nThe <span style=\"text-decoration: line-through;\">real</span> true gem here though, is the song <em>Watch Out</em>, which was the first recorded appearance of Big Pun.\n\n<iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/tMyXjueWZYE\" width=\"420\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe>\n\nNext up, Joe – high off the success of his new artist Big Pun – dropped the still \"street\", but slightly more commercial effort <em>Don Cartagena</em>. It was super feature heavy, and had tracks that were made almost entirely for mainstream radio/tv, namely <em>Don Cartegena</em> featuring Diddy and <em>Bet Ya Man Can’t (Triz)</em> featuring Pun, Cuban Link and Triple Seis. The album did have heat, like the still dope <em>John Blaze</em>. Honestly, in hindsight, this album isn’t that \"commercial\". Especially when you stack it against everything Joe made from this point on in his career. It was just much less street than his first two releases; however it worked in his favour, selling Gold. It was his most successful album to date.\n\nSadly, this is where the train has stopped for me. I wasn’t really a fan of his music from this point on. I mean, he had some heaters here and there, but it just got <em>way</em> too commercial for my personal taste; and that’s no shade, good on him. He has a family to feed, and it’s all about building and elevating. But for me, his music doesn’t have the soul it once did. I highly encourage you dig into his past catalogue though, because he did exist before <em>What’s Luv</em> with Ashanti. He’s the man who brought Big Pun to the forefront – and he deserves all the credit in the world.\n\nLet’s pay tribute to 90’s Fat Joe!\n\n<iframe style=\"border: 0; width: 100%; height: 120px;\" src=\"http://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/track=319936124/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/tracklist=false/artwork=small/transparent=true/\" width=\"300\" height=\"150\" seamless=\"\"><a href=\"http://officialboomboxradio.bandcamp.com/track/fat-joe-was-way-doper-in-the-90s\">Fat Joe Was Way Doper In The 90's by Boom Box Radio</a></iframe>",

    "content_html": "<blockquote><em>\"The passion and purpose are clear, the people authorities fear, whomever you pray to, you need to go thank them for letting this reach to your ear.\"</em>\n\n– XVRHLDY from the song Road Trips</blockquote>\nA few months ago, <a title=\"XVRHLDY: The New Sound Of Chi-Town\" href=\"http://aboveaveragehiphop.com/xvrhldy-new-sound-chi-town/\">I interviewed a cat by the name of XVRHLDY</a>. I even went as far as to proclaim him as the new sound of Chicago – which is a pretty big cosign considering the city's musical roots. To explain, I find him incredibly refreshing. His music seems to blend in and innovate simultaneously, that is to say, it doesn't slap you in the face with blatant oddity, like say Outkast [editor note: he's been sonically compared to Andre 3000], nor does it seamlessly fit into the trap sound that currently rules the city's main arteries.\n\nHis latest release, <em>Need To Know II: Luna</em>, is a big win on a few fronts. It satisfies his core, who were open off of joints like <em><a href=\"https://www.google.ca/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0CCAQyCkwAA&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DyABkg4m_4qg&ei=l6D0VMLHFvOasQT7gILwCg&usg=AFQjCNF9_vclB7TgaI3ootCeQH0-IWHd3w&sig2=tMcv3Qcquzdy5plX-hMdzQ\">Chrome</a></em> and his <a href=\"http://xvrhldy.bandcamp.com/releases\">original tape</a>, but also breaks some new commercial ground. The latter point is important, because I'm tired of telling people they are sleeping on this kid. For the most part, <em>Luna</em> sticks to the formula (not a bad thing). His production ranges from a \"riding around at night\" vibe on tracks like <em>Road Trips </em>and the aggressively flowed <em>Noctuno to a</em> smoothed-out vibe on tracks like <em>Black Alablaster</em> and <em>The Root part II</em> (part one had a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nq2QSyPFznE\">dope visual treatment</a>).\n\nThe standouts here for me were the L.A VanGogh produced <em>New To Me</em>, and his brilliantly executed <em>Marthié François Girbaud</em>, in which he lyrically <span style=\"text-decoration: line-through;\">reminisces</span> time travels back to 1996, to revisit block life and then to 2006 to relive a run-in with Chicago law enforcement. There's also the head nodding <em>True Enough</em>, which is the closest to a literal love song you're going get here.<em> Every Story Ever Told</em>  is also getting serious burn here at the office!\n<blockquote>\"Globally, those memories that are best live through the morning. LUNA is a tale of one of those nights.\"\n\n– XVRHLDY</blockquote>\nOne of the things that struck me about from my <a title=\"XVRHLDY: The New Sound Of Chi-Town\" href=\"http://aboveaveragehiphop.com/xvrhldy-new-sound-chi-town/\">original conversation with X</a> was that he had a great game plan, and this project does a great job of reaffirming that. On <em>Need To Know II: Luna</em>, Xavier avoids overly experimenting outside of his trademark sound, and rather delivers a solid, consistent project that flows from start to finish. Ironically that actually makes for an insanely innovative product. The insanely catchy <em>Hammana</em> sounds like a radio banger too, so hopefully heads who have been sleeping on this cat wake the f– up and smell the deep dish.\n\nChicago is in the building.\n\n<iframe src=\"http://www.audiomack.com/embed4-album/xvrhldy/need-to-know-ii-luna\" width=\"100%\" height=\"350\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe>",

Used during a Hot 97 interview with Azalia Banks, and aimed squarely at Iggy Azalea, the term [in this context] refers to the convenient use of black culture by \"outsiders\". Is Iggy guilty of using our culture [sic] inappropriately? Well, I touched on that already – <a href=\"http://aboveaveragehiphop.com/changed-youre-responsible-iggy-mackelmore/\">read up kiddies</a>\n\nBut I'll take my opinion a step further.\n</p><p>\nThe idea of cultural misappropriation brings up something else; an elephant in the room that people seem afraid to discuss. It's impossible to tear down one white rapper simply for being white – and/or allegedly not possessing authenticity or being fully educated in hip-hop history – without presenting a fully structured set of guidelines. What does one have to do to get a pass? Which white rappers are acceptable and why?\n</p><p>\nThere are plenty of white roots in hip-hop. Eminem, most notably, is one of the most successful rappers of all-time. How about El-P, Beastie Boys or Ra The Rugged Man? How about MC Serch? He's often acknowledged as the one who gave Nas his first break. How about long-time Mobb Deep associate Alchemist? How about we talk about individuals like Steve Rifkind, who brought us WU-Tang and Mobb Deep and Mike Weiss who brought us acts like Black Moon and Mad Lion. How about Rick Ruben? Those last three were executives, but you know what? They've done more for the genre than you (likely) have!\n</p><p>\nListen, good music is good music, and bad music is bad music. Ignorant music knows no boundaries. If Young Thug were white, black Twitter would be losing their f'ing minds. There's a new breed of white rappers like Mac Miller and Action Bronson who, like it or not, are exploding. They – arguably – have a pass. All I'm saying is that we need to define as a culture why it's acceptable for them to exist without argument, but Iggy can't do what, in all honesty, a million and one other black artists are already doing. \n</p><p>\nI just think that we need to be careful here – especially when trying to define who can do what. Unless hip-hop is going to stop taking money from white America, we can't really protest them being a part of the machine. Standards of (cultural) hip-hop knowledge, authenticity and artistic merit should be set across the board, and stand regardless of race. Because without some more strict definition...we just sound like a bunch of haters. Sorry, not sorry.\n</p><p>\nNo shade – and let me say, I'm a real head. I'm on your side (yes you reading this with the screw face on). I just think that the front lines of our culture needs to be more organized when opening a can worms like this. If you missed my last post in why Iggy is your fault, <a href=\"http://aboveaveragehiphop.com/changed-youre-responsible-iggy-mackelmore/\">click here</a>.\n</p><p>\nCarry on.</p>",

A lot of heads are scared to jam unknown acts, but if my time as a writer has taught me anything, it's that an open mind can expose your soul to some serious gems.\n\nThe Hollis Queens duo Run DMC were the the documented inspiration for many golden era acts, including legendary rapper Notorious BIG – and Atlanta-based rapper Jamal STEELE is no different. After seeing the visuals for their smash crossover hit Walk This Way, with Aerosmith, Jamal knew that hip-hop was something he had to do. He describes his career as a mission to \"Impart, Influence, & Inspire\" – sounds a little contrived right? See that's the dope thing about this brother. It Isn't at all! He's extremely genuine. He gave me a copy of his semi-autobiographical new project Driving Toward Our Purpose, and I have to say, I was impressed.\n\nI'm always supportive of cats who not only care about bars, but take the time to create cohesive, intelligent projects, rather than \"choppy piecework\". I will pre-face this review by admitting that I'm a bit ignorant to his full catalogue, but I'm working my way through it. So here's the goods: the album is sonically crafted by GlassC!ty, El-R, Ant Carter, DJ Quezs, Ta-Ku – a name that instantly peaked my interest –and Jamal STEELE himself. It's 10 tracks, and has no filler or interludes.\n\nThe album starts with the hard-hitting Let It Go, where he he airs out clowns on the mic, and asserts the tone for the rest of the project. Some of the standouts for me were the \"be yourself\" anthem Do You, spiritual assertion Love Manifesto, the super lyrical Out There and the super soulful December Rain.\n\nJamal wears his heart in his sleeve: this album sees him sharing not only a healthy dose of well thought out social commentary and life experience, but also his faith. It's a very honest, humble listen. I'm always drawn to cats who exist among radio, BET, MTV – and so on – and still manage to make a viable, non-commercial brand of hip-hop. Not to say that he doesn't want to \"blow-up\", he just isn't dumbing himself down to do it. Salute.\n\nJamal is currently unsigned, but he's definitely worth a listen. You can stream his Driving Toward Our Purpose project below, and you can also check him on\n\n<a href=\"http://www.twitter.com/jamalSTEELE\">Twitter</a>.\n\n<iframe style=\"border: 0; width: 600px; height: 472px;\" src=\"http://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=3985762023/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/artwork=small/transparent=true/\" width=\"300\" height=\"150\" seamless=\"\">&lt;a href=\"http://jamalsteele.bandcamp.com/album/driving-toward-our-purpose\"&gt;Driving TOWARD Our PURPOSE by Jamal STEELE&lt;/a&gt;</iframe></blockquote>",

    "content_html": "<blockquote>If there was one show that set the bar, and arguably still stands as a benchmark for hip-hop radio, it’s the duo of Stretch Armstrong and Bobbito.</blockquote>\nThey always say hip-hop doesn't live on the radio, but that wasn't always a true statement. In it's younger, and arguably <em>better</em> days, hip-hop was very much on the airwaves. I'm also not talking about notable stations like (NYC’s) Kiss that had the likes of Red Alert spinning iconic sets – I'm talking the college circuit. College radio shows were once a breeding ground for the rawest, uncut hip-hop. Where it's mainstream counterparts jammed the most commercially notable records (like actual vinyl) of the day, college radio shows played the shit that mattered.\n\nNo matter where you grew up, there was a local college station that had a show – in my case, It was the <em>Peaceful Journey</em> (on CKCU in Ottawa), with Mikey Wisdom and DJ Ducats. No matter what I was doing, I was home at Fridays at 12am with a cassette tape ready to record all the newest shit so that I could show off at school the following Monday – after meditating on it all weekend (of course). What the internet and much networking over the years have shown me is that this experience is anything but unique. Many a hip-hop head tuned into their respective \"<em>Peaceful Journey</em>\" with a blank Memorex ready to rock.\n\nIf there was one show that set the bar, and arguably still stands as a benchmark for hip-hop radio, it’s the duo of Stretch Armstrong and Bobbito. Their show was broadcasted on Columbia University’s WKCR-FM for four hours every early Thursday morning from 1990 to 1998 and was also broadcasted on Hot 97 from 1996 to 1999. They played combinations of vinyl, cassettes and, on occasion, ADAT reels – dropping intense exclusives and breaking the likes of Biggie, OC, Jay-Z, Nas, Eminem, Mobb Deep, Brand Nubian, DITC, Big L, Wu-Tang Clan and Busta Rhymes. They even rocked with local cats from my city like Thrust and Choclair. The duo’s chemistry, their iconic freestyles, (now) unbelievably mind-blowing demo tapes, online antics and ridiculous mixes had heads filling up tapes and walking around like zombies at work on Fridays. The show was named best radio show of all-time by <i>The Source Magazine</i> – well deserved if you ask me!\n\nTheir iconic episodes became a hot topic online, and heads were feverishly trying to piece together episodes from their old recordings. Any of the cats who actual give a shit know the struggle – digitizing tapes is a long, thankless process; however an incredible team of die-hards on the Philaflava forum worked together to chronicle the show's full timeline and systematically piece together rips. The culmination of years of <a href=\"http://www.hulkshare.com/afn33282\">work can be heard here</a>. They've amassed what plays out as an evolution of golden era hip-hop. There’s everything from classic freestyles by Percee P and Big L (with Children Of The Corn), to classic interviews and promotions for iconic albums that you grew up on. Also great guests DJ’s like Funkmaster Flex and Lord Sear were often heard on the mic, and on the mix. It’s probably the best collection of (hip-hop) music you’ll ever hear. If you will, it’s probably the most effective way I can imagine summing up the best years Hip-Hop had before things got so, you know, commercial and shit.\n\nThe internet is a blessing and a curse. It made <em>primitive</em> concepts like taping songs off the radio, or recording music videos, obsolete. What’s the point? Can you just download it right? But that was the beauty of it – it was harder to get. You either bought it or lost hours of sleep. It had value. It wasn't as disposable. Can you imagine recording a song off of anything nowadays – for that matter, can you imagine being dedicated enough to tune in at an inconvenient time to catch your fave anything? PVR's and social media has you covered.\n\nIn this context, the new one-of-a-kind Wu Tang Album seems like a great idea. Bringing some value back to music...some genuine excitement to get your hands on a physical product. My own \"fly on the wall\" search for the lost Stretch and Bobbito episodes, even though digital, took me back to hot summer evenings sitting by my boom box trying to get a snippet of that hot shit.\n\nLong live the late night cassette tape warriors – and be sure to look out for their upcoming <a href=\"http://stretchandbobbito.com/\">Stretch Armstrong and Bobbito documentary</a>!\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-MZwEMA9yk",

Breathing it.\n\n– Moka Only</blockquote>\nThere’s nothing like pure musical expression that comes from the heart. It’s hard to find in the mainstream (music scene), but it’s easy to find in the expansive catalogue of Vancouver-based artist Moka Only.\n\nRoughly 13 years ago, it was impossible to go anywhere in Canada without hearing the sound of Mad Child, Prevail and Moka Only, otherwise known (collectively) as<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tER43wmSRoc\"> Swollen Members</a>. The trio had a string of hits that ruled both airwaves and television (back when Much Music played actual music). It wasn’t long after 2003 when the smooth voice that graced the bulk of their choruses went solo.\n\nSince the Swollen days, Moka Only has released an almost unheard of amount of music (seriously his Wikipedia lists well over 50 albums), and has worked with the likes of Ayatollah, Abstract Rude, Planet Asia, Dilla and more. He is currently running with a collective artists known as the Torchlight Commission, which consists of Illa J, among others.\n\nHe’s an incredibly hardworking guy, with a genuine love for what he does. In the interview below he shares some insight on his time with Swollen, his inspirations, his work with Dilla, and his upcoming projects.\n\n<hr />\n\n<strong>Can you start by introducing yourself?</strong>\n\nHulooooo! I’m Moka Only, otherwise known as Kareem Serene – among other things. Torchlight commission is my crew. How you doing?\n\n<strong>I’m doing great brother! Not to sound all Brown Sugar, but how did you fall in love with hip-hop music?</strong>\n\nI fell in love with hip-hop at an early age, probably in a similar fashion to a lot of other cats in the 80s. Just being around in the streets after school or even during. Some cats would put out the cardboard on the ground at school and start breakin’ with the box blasting. That made too much of an impression to ignore. I had to be down! Tried my hand at dancing, but it wasn’t my area of excellence. Rap just started happening from doing silly freestyles in 1986 to forgetting about it then picking it back up a couple years later – but with a pen. I was hooked! Still am.\n\n<strong>How did you originally hook up with Swollen Members?</strong>\n\nSwollen Members came out after Prevail and I sort of failed at being a duo. We met up with Madchild, who was also from Vancouver, and it sort of just clicked.This was around 1995. Came up with the name and just started from there. We connected with a lot of our other west-coast contemporaries at the time. I soon after realized I’d rather be solo but we kept doing work together – even more so during the early 2000s when I jumped back in the group for a hot minute. Much love to Swollen.\n\n<strong>You talk about your experience with them on the song “<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lj-4s36nD20\">Sleeping Dogs</a>”. What prompted you to leave the group?</strong>\n\nAs for what I said on sleeping dogs, that was more or less a rundown of my last 15 years. There was no “break up”. It was just me being involved with the group for awhile. We made great music and memories – to this day Swollen <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/SWOLLENMEMBERS\">def doing their thing</a>. I just prefer the solo route, as I mentioned.\n\n<strong>Let’s talk about your work ethic, because your discography is INSANE. How much time do you spend in the studio?</strong>\n\nMy studio ethic is serious, but I still make time for all the other stuff. It’s just that I love the creative aspect so much. That’s where the magic is – and it’s how I can communicate with the cosmos. I don’t really think about it, I just do it. Always been like that. Im not out to prove a point that I work harder than others, i’m just trying to maximize on my time.\n\n<strong><a href=\"http://aboveaveragehiphop.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/unnamed.jpg\" target=\"_blank\"><img class=\"CToWUd alignleft\" src=\"https://ci5.googleusercontent.com/proxy/fGXLLlNg4TAx8utFePMrdJKIfePsbQdDE7GDGvq8R84zf5LkSkwL_bhJwzRMn7N5YkPyu4UHs1eECC5JOiThqXYTl1aA54exPv0pdyTsqAo=s0-d-e1-ft#http://aboveaveragehiphop.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/unnamed.jpg\" alt=\"unnamed\" width=\"323\" height=\"485\" /></a>Do you have lots of unreleased material left over from all of your projects? Can we anticipate more releases like California Sessions Vol. 2?</strong>\n\nOh yes, I have a TON of other unreleased material from the early 2000s. It makes sense that I would, because I was busy with the group thing for a couple years, which didn’t leave a lot of time to put out and promote my solo projects properly. Then when I left the group again, I didn’t really look back on my vaults cause I’d rather make new stuff. At least thats how I felt at the time. It was all recorded on ADAT systems, and if you know anything about ADAT it’s old technology that was plagued with quirks and tape eating. My last machine crashed in 2003 and I didn’t replace it until two years ago, so I was finally able to go back through the tape stuff and mix old songs from 2002 and 2003. There’s SO much! I love it and still feel strongly about the material even though I feel i’ve improved vastly.\n\nThere’s an innocence about the old material that I appreciate. It’s as if the more you learn, the more serious it all gets and you become caught up in the methodology more so rather than the FEELING. I think lately I’ve been returning to the raw FEELING rather than worrying about keeping up with whatever is hot. I’m always just going to be me. I’m not the punchline rapper, I’m more of an arranger of vibes – and yeah, that sounds kinda corny. haha.\n\n<strong>What’s your creative process like?</strong>\n\nTo speak on the creative process I don’t want to give too much away, but let’s just say I do it the “old” way. It's all outboard gear, no protools and all that. I use hardware, samplers, instruments and tape even to create the “Moka” sound, if I may be so bold. I mainly start with beats, because I’m a beat maker at heart first and foremost. The beats will dictate the vibe. I’ll either write or freestyle from that point on, then add more sprinkles and mix it. I do this every day when I’m not on tour so, you can imagine it piles up. Mainly every session is just to get sharper and to have sort of a journal – but if I have a project I’m working on then I stick to the theme of it.\n\n<strong>You’re also (often) known as Ron Contour and Torch. Are these alter-egos, or simply just names?</strong>\n\nRon Contour is really the only other alter ego I’ve used. It’s a whole different character I haven’t visited that much at all lately. All the other names from the past are monikers, just fun stuff to keep it interesting for me and for the fans. Kareem Serene is my latest, even though technically I came up with that in 2003. I’m drinking a coffee right now. Ive never flown a blimp.\n\n<strong>You’ve worked with the late-great J.Dilla, what was that like? What influence did his music have on you?</strong>\n\nAs far as the Dilla thing goes Im not sure what to say about it. I had reached out to him in the early 2000s and he seemed receptive and sent me 6 beat CDs. It was being arranged that I would roll out to Detroit and work with him in person. Being that I’m a pretty solitary person, and more so at the time, I decided I would rather record alone at home and thats what I did. A certain beat stood out to me and I just took it from there, freaked it and <a href=\"https://www.google.ca/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0CCEQtwIwAA&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DKklZAXc3v5w&ei=wGYIVei6AdCsyAT07IDICQ&usg=AFQjCNFyfIt7l9pnmuuGYdTEywXGS8-hKA&sig2=xL7Y-t0A4EbXEjz7kMeRDQ\">released it a couple years later</a>. I always had the utmost respect for him though. In many ways he felt like both a peer and a teacher. A peer in the sense that when I became aware of his music, it felt like I had met a cousin or something. He was on some original shit, and took chances musically. That’s what I felt I was doing – his reliance on jazz textures is something I related to, since I had been doing that since the 90s as well. In the early 2000s it felt like not many other cats were.\n\nAs far as the teacher comment, his techniques bred creative sparks in all of us. I’m happy to say that the vibe has continued now that I do a lot of work with his brother Illa J. He’s also part of the movement I mentioned before, Torchlight Commission. Like-minded folks keeping the torch burning.\n\n<b>This may be a tough question, but what’s your fave album of yours? Can you maybe give a top 3?</b>\n\nI think my fave three albums I’ve released would be <a href=\"http://www.discogs.com/Moka-Only-Lowdown-Suite/release/822006\"><em>Lowdown Suite</em></a>, <a href=\"https://www.google.ca/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0CB4QFjAA&url=http%3A%2F%2Furbnet.bandcamp.com%2Falbum%2Fdoctor-do-much&ei=KwADVZOSHNSqyAT3v4GABA&usg=AFQjCNHt_iYubARgauuyskmOACyre7P4Xg&sig2=1UrV1fOeg6dWyu0pGZHwsQ\"><em>Doctor Do Much</em> </a>and <a href=\"https://www.google.ca/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0CB4QFjAA&url=http%3A%2F%2Furbnet.bandcamp.com%2Falbum%2Fmartian-xmas-2009&ei=PAADVdf_NI74yQSK7oHgBQ&usg=AFQjCNHrfiSoAZOKKORndJYp_Ok0eHMiSw&sig2=NQuTyfYYMNWq9PAj2kfVnw\"><em>Martian Xmas 2009</em></a>. At least right now that’s it…lol.\n\n<strong>What can you tell us about NO?</strong>\n\nNo, I cant tell you about NO. It’s a secret. It won’t be for much longer though. I can say this though: It’s a song. haha.\n\n<strong>What do you have coming up?</strong>\n\nComing up, I’m working on an album called <em>Brutal</em> and another one called <em>Magical Weirdness</em>. Magical Weirdness was made for a certain record label that I don’t want to mention, because I want to do a proper announcement when the time comes and the album is turned in. Plus, there’s a chance they may not even LIKE it. I’m sure they will, but I don’t have expectations other than I know that good shit will happen regardless. Can I hint? hmmm…maybe I’d better not. I also have the NO single, which is independent.\n\nI’m also starting a record label with my manager called Beautiful Records, and no, I’m <em>not</em> looking for demos. I have a couple other cats in mind from my crew that I will release – but anybody that ends up on my label has to have similar musical values. That’s what we’re trying to accomplish with Torchlight Commission, Kinda like how Native Tounges was in the 90s. Just some cats that share a theme, but do they own thing. Not like a Wu-Tang thing, more loose.\n\n<strong>You’ve been in the game for like 20+ years, is it a trip to see how things have changed so much?</strong>\n\nThings have definitely changed. It HAS been a trip. The internets, the disposability of music as a result, and the way music is promoted. But the function remains the same as it did throughout all time – to entertain. THAT wont change. I just keep going for what I know. Just doing it. Living it. Breathing it.\n\n<strong>What keeps you influenced/motivated?</strong>\n\nThe thing that keeps me going is just that, keeping going. I'm inspired by the feedback, and being able to do interviews like this – I appreciate having the podium to speak. Touring is also inspiring. To meet my fans and talk to like minded people is unbelievably beautiful. Just being a human, there’s so much shared experiences to muse upon in song form that we all can relate to. I CANNOT see how an artist could ‘run out of ammo’, so to speak. Just do the damn thing! Don’t worry about what all the other musicians are doing. Yeah. Eggs. Carrots.\n\n<strong>Do you have any last thoughts or shoutouts for our readers?</strong>\n<div>\n<div dir=\"ltr\">\n<div class=\"adL\">\n\nOn a closing note, I want to say thanks for the opportunity to speak – and  start looking up the Torchlight Commission! Between Me, Jon Rogers, Nick Wisdom, Illa J, Astrogical, Mosaic, A-Ro, Mr Brady, etc, we have a <strong>LOT</strong> of bang for your buck <em>and</em> your mind. Much love from Kareem Serene.\n\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n \n\n<iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/D1YTnl8wdck\" width=\"600\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe>",

Live your life and don't let anyone tell you how to live it!\"\n</span><span style=\"line-height: normal; -webkit-text-size-adjust: auto; background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0);\">—Laya LaRoche</span></blockquote>\nAs a preface, I'll say that the R&B game is quite funny sometimes. Things come in waves, which often leaves us with many artists who sound <i>similar</i>. Sometimes though, you bump into a singer that has it factor – a singer on his/her plain, that writes their music and commands your attention. Alicia Keys for example. Some singers just keep it real and lean on pure \"skills\" as opposed to auto tune and commercial influence.\n\nNow, I've been known to get obsessed with tracks on SoundCloud, and last week I lived up my reputation. While cruising for some unsigned hype, I came across New York-based singer Laya LaRoche. Her song<i> No Gravity</i> off of her debut album (she has two) <i>Let Them Eat Cake</i> had me stuck. I decided to reach to and learn more about the songstress.\n\nCheck the interview below.\n\n<hr />\n\n<strong>Can you introduce yourself to our readers?</strong>\n\nAyyyee, my name is Laya LaRoché.\n\n<strong>How did you get involved in music?\n</strong>\nI've been singing my entire life. My family was always involved in music and the performing arts<b>,</b> so singing and creating my songs has been something that has always come naturally to me.\n\n<strong>Who were some of your influences coming into the game?\n</strong>\nBrandy has molded me in many ways. Missy Elliot, Jasmine Sullivan, Spice Girls, Gorillaz, and most of the all black female R&B groups of the 90s.\nI loved the ghetto funk of 90s R&B. My iPod still mostly consists of that type of music to this day.\n\n<strong>What can you tell us about your latest project <em><a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/laya-laroche/sets/seraphic-nightmare\">Seraphic Nightmare</a></em>?\n</strong><i>\nSeraphic Nightmare</i> is a moodier side of me. I wrote most of the songs when I was quite depressed. Even at my lowest I still experienced some moments of joy and happiness, and that's what inspired me to call the collection of these songs <i>Seraphic Nightmare</i>. I was suffering from constant nightmares in real life at the time, and that inspired me to write songs like <i>Run</i> that later proved to be beneficial for me. This bit of good that came out of my sorrow. The seraphic in my nightmare.\n\n<strong>How is it different from <a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/laya-laroche/sets/let-them-eat-cake\"><em>Let Them Eat Cake</em></a>?\n</strong>\nLet Them Eat Cake was more fun and free. It was also my first project, so I was trying to establish a style/sound of my own. There also wasn't an overall theme. Every track had a different vibe, but I like that. When I had released it a lot of people told me that they were disappointed that I didn't \"sing out\" enough and that I was playing it safe. I took note of this and made sure to show my vocal range and just only go off on Seraphic Nightmare which wasn't hard since it was more emotionally driven.\n\n<strong>What's your writing/creative process like?\n</strong>\nI have a lot of producer friends, and I meet more everyday. They'll send me a beat, and I'll vibe to it for a few train rides until the words come to me. I hear the melodies first, and then the words just fall into place. I've written most of my songs while on the train or a bus. When I have those moments to myself while traveling through the chaos, I seem to be more in tune with my inner voice. Weed helps too.\n\n<strong>Think quick: Vinyl or CD? Why?\n</strong>\nI'm part of the CD generation (well cassette tapes really) so I'd have to go with CD. I can skip straight to my favorite track and put it on repeat like that (snaps finger)! And don't forget about the cd walkmans!! Can't carry a vinyl while listening. I do appreciate vinyl tho. I'd love to get vinyl copies of my projects at some point. It's just classic. I'd hate to see them disappear.\n\n<strong>What's your fave album of all time? Why?\n</strong>\nDaaaammnnn. That's hard. It's a toss up between Brandy <i>Never Say Never</i> and Gorillaz debut album. For me, both albums were highly influential. If I had to choose one I would have to go with Brandy, <i>Never Say Never</i>. My mother bought me the cd for Three Kings Day when I was 8 (because we're Spanish, and we give, each other gifts on Three Kings Day). I played the CD on repeat until it didn't work anymore. I love every song on that album. Her voice, the lyrics, the production, her emotion. It was all so on point. I still listen to it on the regular to this day.\n\n<strong>How would you describe your live show?\n</strong>\nMy live show is fun! I try to have as much fun as I can. I usually start with the turn-up records to get people going and then once I've gotten their attention I bring them into my world. With songs like <i>Run</i>, I have a stage hand tie my hands behind my back and put a ski mask over my face. This always makes people shut up. As the music begins, I tell them, about the origins of the lyrics and welcome them into my world. I don't want to give too much away. I would like everyone to see it for themselves (shameless plug).\n\n<strong>What are your goals as an artist?\n</strong>\nMy goals as an artist are to bring back the music that I love and to continue creating new fusions of the music that I love – and pay my rent while doing so. Dead ass.\n\n<strong>What are you currently working on?\n</strong>\nRight now I'm putting together some new visuals. I have plenty of singles out now that I'm dying to shoot videos for. I've got a great team of artists and creatives that I'm super excited about working with. I can't wait to release some new cool juice for you guys!\n\n<strong>Do you have any last words you'd like to leave our readers with?\n</strong>\nDo what you want kitties! Live your life and don't let anyone tell you how to live it! We all have magic in us, and it's up to you how to use it.\n\n<hr />\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Djuq_PPY_70",

    "content_html": "<blockquote>“A great photograph is one that fully expresses what one feels, in the deepest sense, about what is being photographed.”\n\n― Ansel Adams</blockquote>\n<div>\n<div dir=\"ltr\">\n\nHip-hop has always been a very visual medium. Aside from the obvious audible aspect of the listening experience, the first impression most of us have about a new album or artist, is generally formulated from an image. Whether it’s an album cover, promo poster, or just a photo in a magazine. On a personal level, this was especially true in my younger crate digging days. Hip-Hop was always very complimentary to the DJ and grew to be obsessed with the producer, but mostly overlooked the incredible work done by the photographers who’ve been helping society to archive the culture since its inception. Not to say they are<em> entirely</em> overlooked. In fact, most are paid, credited and have strong roots in the industry; however, they aren’t (generally) household names.\n\n</div>\n</div>\n<div>\n<div dir=\"ltr\">\n\nMore importantly, photographers have captured iconic moments in the history of the genre that will live on for generations. Think of them as hieroglyphics. Instagram and sites like Tumblr are recent phenomenons, so documenting important cultural happenings, and meetings of legendary minds wasn’t as simple as pulling out a camera phone.\n\nThe overabundance of available methods to capture moments has made photography more accessible to the average consumer – as can instantly share those moments. The phenomenon of Throwback <span class=\"aBn\" tabindex=\"0\" data-term=\"goog_486340398\"><span class=\"aQJ\">Thursday</span></span> is actually what prompted this article. Millions of heads across the globe get on their respective social networks each week and showcase their love/knowledge of the culture by sharing classic hip-hop photos. Know what they don’t share? The names of the photographer! I’ve done this too though, so we’re all guilty.\n\nI thought we should shed some light on some of the faces behind the camera.\n\nThere are too many to showcase individually, but I’ll get a few names you <strong>SHOULD</strong> know because you’ve been enjoying their photos for years (even if you didn’t know it). Let’s start with <a href=\"https://www.google.ca/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0CB4QFjAA&url=http%3A%2F%2Fchimodu.com%2Fabout&ei=XTUIVfjgMMqQyATC2oAw&usg=AFQjCNFw4k90cU0_56LIXLC8YlUldz8tBw&sig2=mjRZVXTWFmIP74sGLJSf0A\">Chi Modu</a> – the man behind the haunting images on the Mobb Deep <em>Infamous</em> album. As the Director of Photography for<em>The Source Magazine</em>, Chi took some of the most memorable, groundbreaking captures in the history of hip-hop, like that photo of Biggie Smalls with the Twin Towers in the backdrop. How about Ohio-bred photographer <a href=\"http://jonathanmannion.com/\">Jonathan Mannion</a>? He’s an accomplished filmmaker and photographer, who is the man behind the iconic Jay-Z <em>Reasonable Doubt</em> cover, and DMX’s <em>Flesh Of My Flesh</em> artwork. Then there’s <a href=\"http://www.mikeschreiber.com/\">Mike Schreiber</a>, who’s work has graced many pages in publications like the <em>Source </em>and <em>Vibe. </em>His work includes notable shots of Blackstarr (Mos Def & Talib Kweli), The quintessential DMX shot from 1996 and much more. In fact, <em><a href=\"http://www.vice.com/read/meet-mike-schreiber-is-hip-hops-illest-photographer\">Vice Magazine</a></em> named him the “illest hip-hop photographer of all time”.\n\nWhen it comes to more candid captures and portraits that tell the story of hip-hop, you should be up on heads like brother <a href=\"https://www.google.ca/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=3&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0CC0QFjAC&url=http%3A%2F%2Flens.blogs.nytimes.com%2F2013%2F04%2F18%2Fpublic-enemys-private-photographer%2F&ei=1jUIVeCjMov9yQTHwILYAg&usg=AFQjCNH2bkPVaQAonVwOZaCIj5ObSxf-ew&sig2=n1oQhoxbt3pQWVCJTBJTQw\">Ernie Paniccioli</a> and <a href=\"http://www.thereallisaleone.com/\">Lisa Leone</a>. Ernie, who shot everyone from Tribe, Called Quest and Biggie to Heavy D and TLC, was at one point considered to be the personal photographer for Public Enemy. Lisa has incredible shots of artists both pre and post super-stardom. Most notably – I think – are here in-studio shots during the making of Nas’ <em>Illmatic</em>. Both exhibit their work and do many talks.\n\n</div>\n</div>\n<div>\n<div dir=\"ltr\">\n\nPhotographers have always been part of the culture and deserve a little shine. The move towards digital everything has all but eliminated physical album covers, which once made consumers privy to the names behind the artwork, photos, etc. Can anyone take a picture, yes…but anyone can also walk or run or skate. Some people excel in the field. It’s impossible to argue that the photographers I named above don’t just produce photograph, but rather an art.\n\n</div>\n</div>\n\n<hr />\n\n[new_royalslider id=\"2\"]",

    "content_html": "<blockquote>\"So nasty that it's probably somewhat of a travesty...\"<br><br>— DOOM</blockquote><p>It's all entertainment. When it comes to the rap game, you often need to take the character most artists portray both on stage – and on wax – with a grain of salt. Whether most of them reveal it or not, they wear a \"mask\" (so to speak). Without argument no artist plays a character better MF DOOM. While donning his trademark tin mask, he tackles beats with no regard for your thought process. He never breaks character, even in the streets. Why? DOOM himself describes it as freeing, by forcing listeners to focus on the music itself. He tested this theory by using fake DOOMs for a string of shows as few years back. Results were mixed, by which I means terrible.\n\nIrregardless today marks an anniversary for the metal faced villain.\n\nIt's been exactly 11 years since the release of Madvillainy, the collaboration album between the always interesting MF <strike> Doom</strike> DOOM and brilliant producer Madlib. The album still, and always will stand as a testament to alternative hip-hop at it's rawest. The album, stitched together as a collection of seemingly random gems, was non-commercial, creative and packaged with one of the most haunting covers I've ever come across.\n\nThe album, in hindsight, did a few things <i>really</i> well. Firstly, It took DOOM to another level. His previous project <i>Mm Food</i> was dope, and had DOOM's trademark sound, but this project seemed more polished. As seemingly random as it was, it was all orchestrated. DOOM showed many faces – he was a pimp, a pothead, a disgruntled boyfriend, a hustler and a troubled soul. He created a body of work that definitely requires multiple listens. Secondly, it really solidified Madlib as the shit. Not to say he wasn't dope before this – his work has been fire since Lootpack. But <i>Madvillainy</i> was a whole new plane as far as I'm concerned. From <i>Accordion</i> and <i>Money Folder </i>to <i>All Caps</i> and <i>Rhinestone Cowbo</i>y, his sound was eerie, inspiring and beautiful.\n\nDOOM never really topped this album in my mind, and it's an album I'll probably listen to <i>and</i> love it years from now. It stands as a milestone in the Stones Throw catalogue. What it lacked in structure, coherence and adherence to commercial standards it more than made up for with creativity, production and sheer dopeness. \n\nRemember, all caps when you spell the man's name!\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4iR668Ki3I&app=desktop</p>",

    "content_html": "At the turn of the millennium, alternative hip-hop label Def Jux was dropping some pretty avant garde shit. The game was in a weird place – the golden era was over, and we weren't as deep in the musical \"cesspool\" we're engulfed in today. Artists like MF DOOM thrived in this particular pocket of time, as did the harlem duo Cannibal Ox. Rappers Vast Aire and Vordul Mega, over a sound bed provided by El-P (one half of Run the Jewels), released <em><a class=\"fl ellip _Wqb\" title=\"The Cold Vein (2001)\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qPw7_z4sCs\">The Cold Vein</a></em> in 2001, which was acclaimed as one of the best hip-hop albums of the preceding decade. Unfortunately, following a falling out with Def Jux, the duo all but disappeared. After a serious of empty promises of a awaited reunion, they emerged with a dope <a href=\"https://www.google.ca/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=2&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0CCQQFjAB&url=https%3A%2F%2Fitunes.apple.com%2Fus%2Falbum%2Fblade-of-the-ronin%2Fid960141128&ei=tqcRVff2OtLbsATGwoCQCA&usg=AFQjCNEpD5kkwl0YlyIHPUhMGnuA9Eovng&sig2=3pXAssGfEKHXYcwX9ALzSg\">new album</a> <strong>and</strong> a new sound. That sound belongs to New York-bred producer/rapper Bill Cosmiq.\n\nI recently had an opportunity to chat with Bill about his music, his influences and how he became the go-to producer for one of hip-hop's most acclaimed underground groups.\n\n<hr />\n\n<strong>Can you start by introducing yourself to the people?</strong>\n\nI’m a producer/emcee based out of New York City. I’m ½ of the group “The Quantum” and lead producer of Cannibal Ox’s <em>Blade of the Ronin </em>album.\n\n<strong>How did you get into music?</strong>\n\nI’ve made music for years, developing beats for friends and local artists. I never put pressure on myself to record albums in the past. I jumped into the scene in recent years because I wasn’t hearing a lot of music I enjoyed. I was compelled to make a contribution.\n\n<strong>What/who were some of your influences?</strong>\n\nI’m influenced by all great musicians. Countless people have made an impression on me from Lee “Scratch” Perry to producers like DJ Premier and Timbaland.\n\nGrowing up, I remember seeing Quincy Jone’s signature on the back of Chaka Khan albums, movie soundtracks and Michael Jackson’s <em>Thriller</em> album. Seeing those album credits drove my interest in developing music across genres.\n\n<strong>How would you describe your sound?</strong>\n\nI never put a label on my sound. Once I try to define it, I set an unnecessary boundary. I just try to keep it honest and inspired.\n\n<strong>What’s your creative process like when you produce/write?</strong>\n\nI try to get in a zone and allow my beats to naturally come together. Sometimes I have a seed of an idea before I sit down and work, but most times I work without an idea of what I want the outcome to be. Discovery is always part of my process.\n\nWhile making a beat, lyrics start to come to me inspired by what I hear. The music always drives a mood or mindset.\n\n<strong>How did The Quantum (Salvador and you) come together?</strong>\n\nWe’ve known each other for years. We worked on music because we have a similar vision of the records we want to make. The response people had to our collaboration helped to drive the formation of “The Quantum”. No gimmicks or forced music. The Quantum is the middle ground where our creative styles meet.\n\n<strong>Can tell us a little about the <a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/the-quantum/sets/the-quantum-paragon-ep\"><em>Paragon EP</em></a>?</strong>\n\n<em>The Paragon</em> EP was an introduction to The Quantum’s sound. It’s a window into our mindset and what we are offering to the culture of Hip Hop and music community at large. I feel like we are bringing the spirit of the “golden era” with a future-forward approach. The EP also features Kenyattah Black, Taj Hotep and Vast Aire.\n\n<strong>You are the main producer of the latest Can Ox project, how did that come about?</strong>\n\nI linked up with Vast Aire years ago through a mutual friend, Taj Hotep. The first track we released was <em>Royal Purple Bag</em> off of Vast’s <em>A Space Iliad</em> EP. After that, Can Ox and I continued to connect and work on a number of records.\n\nThe team really responded to my beats which produced some inspired studio sessions. Ideas exchanged back and forth and the consistency of those sessions helped to fuel the energy behind <em>Blade of the Ronin</em>. It all comes down to chemistry in the lab.\n\n<strong>What was the process of putting Blade Of The Ronin together?</strong>\n\nI wanted the album to have a cohesive feeling all around. We didn’t rush the creative process. I let things come naturally and the compositions started developing an intense cinematic edge.\n\nAfter we created “Gotham” in 2013, Cannibal Ox and I started to discuss <em>Ox City</em> and what that environment is like. We discussed the look, tone and feel of that city. <em>Blade of the Ronin</em> is like a soundtrack that illustrates a walk through that environment.\n\n<strong>What is your fave song on the album, and why?</strong>\n\nI look at the album as a whole. The whole listening experience of the album is favoured.\n\n<strong>What's next for Bill Cosmiq?</strong>\n\nI’m focused on producing more quality music and presenting my creative ideas to listeners. The Quantum has a new project in the works and I’ve been collaborating with a diverse range of artists. I’m interested in working on a film score in the near future as well.\n\n…Cannibal Ox and I are still in the shop working on new heat!\n\n<strong>Any last words or shoutouts you'd like to leave our blog with?</strong>\n\nShout out to my IGC family and Above Average Hip Hop\n\n<iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/playlists/84042872&color=ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false\" width=\"100%\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"no\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe>",

    "content_html": "<blockquote>He still has bars on top of bars – stuffed with more bars; however this album seems far less rushed.</blockquote>\nAs far as rap characters go, there aren't many in the game with the background of overweight-spitter Action Bronson, coming straight out of Flushing Queens. Aside from his infamous <i>Fuck That's Delicious</i> web series, he's been hitting you with heaters for the past few years now. Amidst early comparisons to Wu-Tang Clan over-achiever Ghostface Killah – whom he toured with (haters) – Action has risen into the spotlight and it's now his time to smack the rap game in the f—ing face on a commercial level. Listening to this project it's hard to swallow (<i>pause</i>) that he's been rapping for just over five years. He quit his career as a chef to pursue rap, which will explain his extremely elaborate food references.\n\nAfter a fifth full listen I've come to some conclusions about Action's major-label debut album, <i>Mr. Wonderful</i>. It's brilliant. If you've been following his career over the past few years, you'll notice the growth he's had. He still has bars on top of bars – stuffed with more bars; however this album seems far less rushed. It has an interesting blend of sounds and emotions. The fun, airy vibe of the Mark Ronson produced <i>Brand New Car</i> sets the tone nicely. Don't go into this album without a sense of humour and an open mind.\n\nThe soundscape here is so well compiled. From the absolutely gorgeous <i>Terry</i> produced by Alchemist, the radio-friendly <i>Actin' Crazy</i> produced by OVO's own 40 to the psychedelic Party Supplies produced <i>Easy Rider</i>, he literally bodies every beat – one exception (for me) was the Oh No produced <i>Only In America</i>. It was a little more \"meh\" than the rest of the tracks. The album's most memorable moments happen halfway through when Action sings on the funky Mark Ronson joint <i>City Boy Blues</i>, which transitions in the <b>super dope</b> <i>Baby Blue Eyes</i>, featuring Chance The Rapper. If you haven't peeped the visuals for that track yet, scroll to the bottom. You're welcome.\n\nOverall it's an incredibly impressive album. It has bars, amazing production and enough reply value to keep this one in the deck for a hot minute. I recently read that he's also releasing a cook book with a number of famous chefs. Like it or not, Action is shaping up to have a better year than most of the other rappers on the scene right now. Don't hate – make better music.\n\n<iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/bVP_w1rQweE\" width=\"620\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe>",

    "content_html": "<p>When it comes to female MC's, who I always think of as just <i>MC's</i>, they seem to fall into two distinct groups these days: those who have bars and those who lean on their sexuality as a crutch. There's something to be said about having a deep roots in the culture you're contributing to. Enter Venomiss.</p><p>Hip-hop artist, and writer, Venomiss has paid her dues, rocking stages and battling her way into the game. Although she's currently writing for several websites and publications, such as HipHopDurso.com, music is still her main priority. \n\nGet to know Venomiss a little better in the interview below.\n</p><hr>\n<p><strong>Introduce yourself</strong>\n\nThey call me Venomiss! I'm a female MC and Hip Hop Journalistic Writer from Orange, NJ. I write for a few blogs and magazines and I do my own music as an independent artist.\n\n<strong>How did you get involved in music?</strong>\n\nMusic was always around me in one way or another so it all kind of came together. My mom loved music and there was never a day in my house without music playing when I was young... Bob Marley, Sade, Kenny G, The Gap Band, Luther... you name it. I became in love with music. My dad was into being a DJ and he would let me practice, so I developed a ear for rhythms and drum patterns. He had some bars too! When I got older, my cousins were a huge part of me getting involved since they were heavy into hip hop and in rap groups of their own. Music became my happy place in life. It became my escape and my voice when I didn't think I had the courage to face the things I was up against. At the same time I don't think any one thing made me a MC, I believe it developed naturally in me and was brought out by events in my life both good and bad.\n\n<strong>Who are some of your influences?</strong>\n\nHonestly, most of the people who influence will never see a deal or the mainstream recognition. As a MC who started out literally walking up to groups of MCs that I didn't know who were in a cypher and basically jumping into their rotation, being around others who are hungry and creative influences me most. I didn't care who's hood I was in, what street I was on or who's shows, I just needed to be in the cypher! In turn, I met a lot of really talented MCs who I learned a lot from. Personal experiences and life lessons also influence me. Things I've seen or done. I draw influence from moods too I am definitely a mood writer. Sometimes the beat will influence me to write to a certain feeling I'm having.\n\n<strong>Tell me about your music.</strong>\n\nI've been doing music since I was about 12 or 13, and took it seriously about 15 or 16. My music is about balance. I bring the street edge and I also bring hooks and lyrics that people can still go along with. I'm not so far old school Hip Hop that I can't also appreciate and bring the new school Hip Hop too.I find young and old Hip Hop heads like my music. They all seem to find something they like about it. I saw a post on Twitter one time from a good friend of mine that reminds me of my music. It made me laugh actually when I saw it. The post was about being sophisticated ratchet. That describes my music to me. The post was saying sophisticated ratchet is hood enough to step up but smart enough to know when to. That's how I feel about my music. It's not too left field that you can't respect it, but it ain't above taking the earnings off and showing you the business either!\n\n<strong>Tell me about your sound.</strong>\n\nThe most common feedback I get about my sound is my voice. I'm told I have a great voice for hip hop and radio often. People look for someone to compare it to but they generally just go back to saying they like the way my voice sounds on the beats when they can't find a direct match in their minds. My choice of production things that grab your attention. I like a little bounce to my records; almost a southern bounce without it being trap. I do draw some southern influences and I guess that comes from being a fan of Bone Thugs, but I am a Jersey girl born and raised so I also draw influences from Fabolous, Jay-Z, Jadakiss too. I guess I just like to be able to bounce to the beat.\n\n<strong>What are you currently working on?</strong>\n\nI just dropped the video for \"<i>They Want</i>\" which has been one of two singles off the upcoming album. I started out with the mindset that I was recording an EP but its honestly been so hard to narrow it down. My producers and I really have just been working off of our vibes and creating with no limitation. So I believe its growing from an EP to a full project. I've been in the studio a lot and focusing on making this a good project. Speaking of the album, it should be out soon. Stay tuned to my Twitter and website because I will be announcing dates in the upcoming weeks. I'm still writing for the blogs and magazines and honing my skills in that department too. Its been a great addition to my music to be able to write about something I love. I have some other behind the scenes ventures i'm exploring too.\n\n<strong>What are your fave albums ever?</strong>\n\nI can't narrow this down, I would be kidding myself if I said I could. Some of my favorite albums ever are:\n</p><p></p><ul>\n\t<li>Notorious B.I.G- <i>Life after Death</i></li>\n\t<li>Busta Rhymes- <i>E.L.E</i></li>\n\t<li>Wu Tang- <i>Forever</i></li>\n\t<li>Lauryn Hill- <i>Miseducation of Lauryn Hill</i></li>\n\t<li>Miss E Elliot- <i>So Addictive</i></li>\n\t<li>DMX-<i> It's Dark and Hell is Hot</i></li>\n\t<li>Jay-Z <i>Reasonable Doubt</i></li>\n\t<li>Nas- <i>Illmatic</i></li>\n\t<li>Bone Thugs n Harmony - <i>Creeping On a Come Up</i></li>\n\t<li>Ruff Ryders- <i>Ryde Or Die Vol 1</i> </li>\n</ul><p>\n...Just to name a few that really stuck with me over the years and that aren't as obvious. My all-time collection usually includes albums that changed the game in some way with their release. They either change the way we see something, or set a tone of some sort.\n\n<strong>Do you perform live? Describe how you approach a live show.</strong>\n\nPerforming live is really important in music. You have to do it. I do it and even at my first show, I have never been shy. I get on stage and nothing else matters to me but performing. My approach to a show is to give the best performance I can. Not all venues are going to be the best venue, not all are going to have a great sound system and be packed. I just get up there and have a good time and I try my best to connect with the audience and give them a good idea of who I am.\n\n<strong>Where can the people find you?</strong>\n\nAnywhere on the web you can find me at itsvenomiss:\n\nTwitter.com/itsvenomiss\nInstagram.com/itsvenomiss\nFacebook.com/itsvenomiss\nsoundcloud.com/itsvenomiss\nand Venomissworld.com.\nfor booking email bookvenomiss@gmail.com \n\n<b>Do you have any shoutouts?</b> Shoutout to everyone involved in this project.

    "content_html": "<blockquote>\"This is not a serious academic study. This is an, like, 'I thought it'd be cool on the Internet [project]...\"\n\n– Matt Daniels, in a interview with NPR.</blockquote>\nMeet <a href=\"http://www.mdaniels.com/\">Matthew Daniels</a> – a New York based designer, data scientist and hip-hop head. Also, he's possibly the coolest guy ever, and I'm personally obsessed with his hip-hop focused research. The sheer detail of his work is amazingly entertaining to explore.\n\nHe originally came to my attention when I was perusing Reddit and stumbled upon his <a href=\"http://mfdaniels.tumblr.com/post/93313634355/updated-rappers-sorted-by-size-of-vocabulary-20\">hip-hop vocabulary project</a>. Essentially he analyzed the first 35,000 lyrics of various American hip-hop artists and established a hierarchy based on the artists use of varying vocabulary that sparked much conversation – and debate. There were a few surprises, and a few confirmations (like DMX having the lowest vocabulary of those analyzed). Some artists, such as Biggie Smalls, weren't able to be analyzed, as they didn't have enough recorded material.\n\n<a href=\"http://i.imgur.com/49pf3Ip.png\"><img class=\"alignnone\" src=\"http://i.imgur.com/49pf3Ip.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"100%\" /></a>\n\nI asked Matt how he conceived this<em> insanely</em> interesting concept:\n\n\"This was orginally going to be a collaboration with another media company. We were throwing around ideas, and this is the one we landed on. I had been learning a python framework called <a href=\"https://www.google.ca/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0CB4QFjAA&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.nltk.org%2F&ei=xWUVVfDZKMPwoASAhoGIDQ&usg=AFQjCNFAaOWlHZHy3sIDfIX4Hsc4O8s_aw&sig2=3cosot549cawaE4pUvbUEQ&bvm=bv.89381419,d.cGU\">NLTK</a>, which is for language processing. The first chapter of the manual for NLTK is on measuring the unique number of tokens (words) in a body of text. I just adopted this approach for the hip hop lyrics data set.\"\n\nUnderstandably this level of hip-hop nerdery broke the internet. As Matt explained, \"adding quantitative data to lyricism isn't common, so it was exciting to have this as a discussion point in hip hop. The biggest surprises were that the data validated a lot of my assumptions: artists who were more experimental with their lyrics ended up using a wider vocabulary (e.g., Outkast)\". How do you top a project with this much cool factor?\n\n<a href=\"http://aboveaveragehiphop.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Screen-Shot-2015-03-27-at-9.28.27-AM.png\"><img class=\"alignleft size-full wp-image-1483\" src=\"http://aboveaveragehiphop.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Screen-Shot-2015-03-27-at-9.28.27-AM.png\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2015-03-27 at 9.28.27 AM\" width=\"100%\" /></a>\n<blockquote>\"Producers understand the minutia – the exact note at the exact millisecond that creates an interesting beat. I wish that more people understood this process and gift.\"</blockquote>\nMatt's latest project is <a href=\"http://samplestitch.com/\">Sample Stitch</a>, an interactive (responsive) web experience that allows users to recreate beats by Dilla, Kanye and 9th Wonder using all the original elements. He's broken the songs into individual samples, and assigned all the samples to different keyboard keys. Essentially this allows users to use their keyboards like a classic MPC. The result? A new found appreciation for the difficulty, and intricacy of<i> legit </i>hip-hop production. What inspired this project? Matt explains: \"there was this project called <a href=\"https://www.google.ca/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0CB4QFjAA&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.patatap.com%2F&ei=T1sVVdGNM5OwogTnwIG4DQ&usg=AFQjCNF0G7sug1rJBtmZ5YnpfLVxkZ1HmQ&sig2=Ngmx4u96bhGAJWBKxeUFBQ&bvm=bv.89381419,d.cGU\">Patatap</a> that used a computer keyboard to trigger sounds. I thought that this was genius because a computer keyboard is a native instrument for most people - we can play it naturally in the same way a musician approaches a piano.\"\n\nIt's sheer dopeness hasn't gone unnoticed.\n\n<a href=\"http://aboveaveragehiphop.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Screen-Shot-2015-03-27-at-9.33.07-AM.png\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-1485 size-full\" src=\"http://aboveaveragehiphop.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Screen-Shot-2015-03-27-at-9.33.07-AM.png\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2015-03-27 at 9.33.07 AM\" width=\"614\" height=\"255\" /></a>\n\n \n\nThat's just the tip of the iceberg. His other work includes an in depth look at the <a href=\"http://www.mdaniels.com/outkast\">cultural influence and nuances of Outkast</a>, and historic<a href=\"http://www.mdaniels.com/shorty\"> analysis of the use of the word \"Shorty\" </a>– and both are must-reads for any real hip-hop head. When talking to Noisy (re: Sample Stitch) Matt explained that he was, bottom line, trying to \"<em>break the Internet again</em>\". With this level of ingenuity, I doubt this is the last time that he'll do just that!\n\nIf you have yet to explore his work, be sure to <a href=\"http://www.mdaniels.com/\">visit his web-site</a>.",

From it's \"costumey\" beginnings, to its adoption of Adidas and gold chains – a style we still pull from today – it's always been important to look the <i>part</i>. In the golden age of hip-hop, no brand stood more iconic than <a href=\"http://worldoftroop.com\">Troop Sport</a>. It was the <i>go-to</i> brand and counted the likes of LL Cool J and Rakim among its brand champions.\n\nUnfortunately, amidst unfounded – and untrue – rumors that it was owned by the Ku Klux Klan (amongst other things), the company went bankrupt. There had been a few attempts at reviving the brand, most notably by rapper Nelly in 2006 when he briefly reintroduced it into the market.\n\nEnter David Goldberg. He recently acquired the brand and, 30 years after it's original release, is bringing it back from the dead and onto the backs and feet of collectors and urban aficionados worldwide. I recently spoke to David about the brand's resurgence. Check out the interview below.\n<div></div>\n\n<hr />\n\n<b>Tell us a bit about yourself.</b>\n\nMy name is Dave; I grew up in NYC in the late 80s/early 90s and Troop was one of my favorite brands. I have vivid memories of LL Cool J endorsing and wearing the brand, as well as my favorite artists of that time. It was marketed as a hip-hop brand and was the first brand to do so. The shoes weren't marketed as athletic shoes; they were just meant more for fashion, and I think that was part of the reason it took off.\n\n<b>\nCan you talk about the legacy that Troop has in the landscape of hip-hop?\n</b>\n\nTroop was an important part of the golden era of the genre, as it exemplified the power hip-hop had to inspire an entire brand. Since Troop, hip hop clothing brands grew into a multi-billion dollar industry – but it all started out as Troop.\n\n<b>Who were some of the brand's biggest advocates?</b>\n\nLL started wearing the brand on his own, and when he became one of the biggest artists, Troop signed him to a deal for his line of clothing and shoes. Today his old original signature products go for <i>big</i> money on eBay. Many other artists in that period wore the brand as well, like Stetsasonic and Marley Marl from the Juice Crew. In 2006, Nelly obtained the license for Troop apparel and brought it back to the market for a short period.\n\n<b> Can you describe the circumstances that led Troop Sport going bankrupt?\n</b>\n\nI was only about 9 or 10 when the brand died down, but from what I heard there were a lot of bad business decisions combined with unfounded rumors, and changing tastes of the consumer that lead to the brand dying out by the early 90s in America; however, Troop lasted longer in Europe than here surprisingly and had a strong run into the mid 90s. Today there are still a large number of Troop collectors from overseas.\n\n<b> Why have you decided to bring the brand back?\n</b>\n\nI decided to bring the brand back because I felt it would fit in well in the current marketplace given the current 80s/90s <i>retro</i> popularity for both shoes and fashion. It's important that the product and brand stay true to the originals.\n\n<b> What products can we look forward to?\n</b>\n\nWe'll be debuting the footwear, starting with the Pro Edition Mid and Ice Lamb Low, in mid to late April in stores across the USA such as Villa, Jimmy Jazz, Dr.Jays and others – as well as online at worldoftroop.com. We had a limited retro leather jacket for sale at a few stores in NYC and Philadelphia the past winter, and it sold very well. In the future, we will be expanding the apparel line as well.\n\n<img src=\"http://aboveaveragehiphop.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/IMG_4635-0.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"100%\" />\n\n<img src=\"http://aboveaveragehiphop.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/IMG_4634-0.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"100%\" />\n\nGood fashion never goes out of style!",

With a showy event, and high quality video, some fans and media were (moderately) dazzled by the vale of artistic merit and buzzwords, but seem to be overlooking the fact that this is just another streaming music service.\n\nIrregardless of the interface the service uses, it's still a pay-to-play app that plays music on your computer or portable device. Most consumers seemed put off by the service's tiered price, but in all honesty, the $20 USD fee for the higher sound fidelity <i>probably</i> doesn't effect them. Audiophiles might give a shit, but not the average head.\n\nBesides the service's seemingly ambivilant attitude towards its \"late to the party\" status, here's what kind of irked me at face value – and please understand I have no current info on the fine print of its artist share. Listen, I get it. Artists aren't getting paid as much as they should for streaming. Services like Spotify, which are partly owned by labels, are blurring lines and paying artists next to nothing for the use of their music. But why is this surprising? Labels have been stiffing artists for years. There is no money in the commercial sale of music through a label. The money is in live performing and merchandising. It's a fact.\n\nMusic today is different. The way the average person consumes it is much different. A streaming music service owned by music artists will change the course of music history about as much as a Wal Mart employ owning a franchise of the store would change the course of retail history. I think the most ridiculous thing is that they are using buzz words and phrases like \"bringing the art to the forefront\" and \"letting creativity reign\" to describe this service. When De La Soul uses Kick Starter to raise hundreds of thousands of dollars from loyal fans to produce, manufacture and release a new album, they are putting \"creativity first\", and transparently giving fans something of value.\n\nTidal comes off like a group of rich mainstream elite complaining. It has the appeal of a group of Oscar winners scolding moviegoers for streaming movies for free online. Fans pay ridiculous ticket pricing for concerts – OVO and Kanye tickets go anywhere from $100 to, well, infinite. Fans shouldn't have to spend more money out of guilt for a service that seems motivated by business rather than artistic merit. That's all I'm saying. The rich get richer.\n\nRant over.",

It's currently available for preorder on Kickstarter in digital, and physical format. Tiered levels of support come with perks, such as De La Soul USB keys, shoes and limited edition shirts. Needless to say, I'm excited to get my copy of the album in the mail, and review here for all of you.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">It seems like many artists are finding themselves on platforms like Kickstarter (and indigogo) these days. Some notable projects have included <a title=\"Big Pun – Bronx Legends Never Die\" href=\"http://aboveaveragehiphop.com/big-pun-bronx-legends-never-die/\">Domingo's Big Pun EP</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/raskass/ras-kass-untitled-project-2010-limited-cd-and-vin-0\">Ras Kass's A.D.I.D.A.S project</a>. Let's face it, independent music sales isn't easy, and the production of an album is (generally) far from free. Kickstarter campaigns really make an artist vulnerable, but can also help them gauge the loyalty of their fanbase, and actual demand for their music. Allowing fans to be a part of your process and know that their money is positively benefitting the actual production of your music is a valuable connection to make. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">It's this type of platform that has record labels scrambling. Kickstarter (and others) has unwittingly created a platform for musicians to sell music and keep 100% of the take, minus any personal overhead and nominal handling fee of course. My thought is that we may see that change in the future. Perhaps a Kickstarter for musicians, that finds a way to generate more revenue for the company. But for the time being, it's an amazing outlet for acts like De La Soul, and up and coming acts such as <a href=\"https://www.google.ca/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0CB4QFjAA&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.kickstarter.com%2Fprojects%2F232550405%2Flil-dickys-kickstarter-album-videos-touring&ei=KPgbVYT2O8OfyAS20YG4DA&usg=AFQjCNFSyuMq56RC3Mgnj4H8J1XiBdHpgA&sig2=3MQbY8ZahltLz1dLyZrw1g\">Lil'Dicky</a> to positively exploit growing fan bases, and loyal followers in a way that simply posting music for sale on services like Bandcamp can't replicate.. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Maybe instead of artist trying to change the face of music history with streaming music services, they should more intimately and authentically connect with their fans and produce a crowd sourced project. Just saying. This is the wave!</span></p>\nhttps://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1519102394/de-la-souls-new-album\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">If you want to grab a copy of that<a href=\"https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1519102394/de-la-souls-new-album\"> new De La Soul</a>, you have 29 days and counting! </span></p>",

His wordplay is godly – even if it almost seems jarringly off putting at times. His ingenuity and <i>ironically</i> marketable lack of \"commercial appeal\" are what every rapper wished they had.\n\nRightfully so.\n\nSo it didn't surprise fans that much when he released <a href=\"http://m.youtube.com/watch?v=zTBIvIDnnv8\">this video</a> both praising the rapper, and effectively outing himself as a super-fan. He then joined DOOM for a joint tour, which ended kind of disastrously due to DOOM's lack of attendance – and use of non-worthy stand-ins. I was at the Toronto show during that tour, which was the show following the \"riot inducing\" <a href=\"http://www.fakeshoredrive.com/2010/02/promoter-speaks-on-mf-doom-concert-dooms-entrance-exit.html\">Chicago show</a>. That's another story though.\n\nAfter that point, Mos seemed to refrain from <i>publicly</i> aligning himself with the now UK-based villain. That's until recently. Mos, now known professionally as Yasiin Bey, was the star of the 7 part, gradual release web-series <i>BeyonDOOM</i> by Culturebox, France Televisions' digital Art & Culture on demand service, paying homage to DOOM. Gradually revealing more of his face as the series progresses, Mos spits various doom tracks, including <i>Accordion</i> and <i>Curlz</i> (amongst others).\n\nNot fully clear on the intended purpose of the project, or what they're trying to promote, but it's <b>super</b> dope, and gets my seal of approval.\n\nGive it an eye.\n\nhttp://youtu.be/pg9tuC8-X6A",

    "content_html": "We’re trying something new with the unsigned hype section. Welcome to the second instalment of <i>Playing 8 Questions With</i>, where we bring you a quick Q&A with a curated up & coming artist. This week we talk to Tha Soloist, a dope cat I'm currently bumping out of Jersey. Give this cat an ear!\n<hr></hr>\n<b>Introduce yourself.</b>\n\nHey, I go by Tha Soloist. The name has many different meanings. You'll figure it out one day. Just know that it's deep. I'm a deep artist. I'm a weirdo. I like that.\n\n<b>How did you get involved in music?</b>\n\nMy dad stuck a needle in his arm, so I chose to put the needle on the record instead. Both get you high, but I love music. I'm glad I didn't go that route. Around 94'. Like Method Man said, \"I came to bring the pain.\" That's my whole style. Blues Hop.\n\n<b>Who are some of your influences? </b> \n\nEveryone influences me in a way, but if I had to say...it would be Bob Dylan, MF DOOM, Wu-Tang, Nas, Billy Joel. I don't discriminate. I love it all. Even Jay-Z and Em influenced me.Back then it was Big Daddy Kane, Biz, Rakim, G Rap. The greats.\n\n<b>Tell me about your music.</b>\n\nMy music is all about FEELING. I want everyone to relate, you know what I mean? Everyone can't relate to being rich. Everyone can't relate to being poor, but EVERYONE can relate to feeling down at some point. Going through dark times. That's my music. I don't always talk about the sad shit, but yeah, that's my avenue. I'm a poet that \nwrites tragedies. \n\n<b>Tell me about your sound.</b>\n\nMy sound is the sound of the soul expressing itself to the fullest. When you hear my music you know right away. You know the SOUL is in there. Once I get a beat I write to it.I work off of inspiration. I'm spontaneous. I don't like to hold on to something.  Once I make the music I want you to hear it while it's still fresh. Nobody wants someold moldy bread. I give it to you while it's still hot out the oven. \n\n<b>Talk to us about your latest project. Who did you work with?</b>\n\nMy last project only had one feature. Tone Liv. Other than that it was all me. The producers I worked with did a great job. Vic Grimes, Giallo Point, Mister Dige. He's one the illest. UK cat. I also got a few joints with my boy Sultan Mir; A GENIUS. The last LP was called REP THE THINKER. It speaks for itself. I represent the thinker,and my fans do too. \n\n<b>What are your fave albums ever?</b>\n\nWu-Tang Forever, Tupac's Greatest Hits, Born Like This (DOOM) and a few others.\n\n<b>Do you perform live? Describe how you approach a live show.</b>\n\nYes, I perform  live. I just get on stage and do my thing. I let the passion control me. I don't do too many songs either. My memory sucks. But that's okay I guess. Three tracks is enough. I usually do an acapella before or after.\n\n<b>Where can people find you?</b>\n\nGoogle Tha Soloist. I got a YouTube channel, SoundCloud, my Facebook name  is Angel Vergara. Hit me up whenever. I'm approachable. Don't spell it like this: THE SOLOIST. I'm Tha Soloist. \n\n<b>Any shoutouts?</b>\n\nShoutout to BBZ Darney, we got a track out now. Shoutout to the aspiring artists. Believe in yourself. I love you all. Peace! My new LP Daily Allowance coming Late April.\n\nhttp://youtu.be/Lvf2wdoZ9VE?list=UUPrBNR-PE3O5y4otTw6riOg",

Well, I don’t mind being in <em>this</em> box if all I got to do is do what I did in the beginning.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">– Saukrates</p>\n</blockquote>\n<div>\n\nThe Canadian music scene has come a long way – and that’s no exaggeration. Artists like Drake and P.Reign are repping the city of Toronto globally, much to the chagrin of many World Star Hip-Hop trolls. Contrary to popular belief, the hip-hop scene in the city has been thriving since, well, <a href=\"https://www.google.ca/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=video&cd=2&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0CCMQtwIwAQ&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DWWHWnFz29gU&ei=9NkmVYW8IcmfsAWh5oGQAw&usg=AFQjCNG4J0mX8t6zmYLGApagyVYnrdmWwQ&sig2=1V7wXcrqVz5T0_NpCOCihQ\"><em>forever</em></a>. Few artists have stood the test of time better than rapper and producer Saukrates, a member of the famed Circle crew, which includes the likes of Kardinal Offishall, amongst others.\n\n</div>\n<div>\n\nHe’s been around the scene, and then some. His gold, award-winning debut album featured Common, Heltah Skeltah, Xzibit and more. He’s a member of Redman’s Gilla House camp and was once signed to Def Jam records. He’s produced music for the likes of <a href=\"https://www.google.ca/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0CCAQyCkwAA&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DoHyqdWlZNPM&ei=QNkmVfnIAYmusAXiyoDYCQ&usg=AFQjCNFYGnufd9dJrGkgJY5S-Tms0TBzvg&sig2=8y0ijakOALtsJzlV3bNlZA\">Nas</a> and performed on stages across the nation – and across the border. He’s a seasoned, well-respected vet, and he was kind enough to chat with me about his career, his latest project, <i>Amani,</i> and more.\n\nCheck the interview below.\n\n<hr />\n\n<strong>Let’s talk about how you got into hip-hop.</strong>\n\nI think all of us started out as fans you know – just fans of hip hop. I think maybe around maybe ’86-’87, when LL, Rakim, EPMD, and Big Daddy Kane came out is when I locked in. I already had an interest in the arts, because I grew up playing classical violin, so I <em>always</em> had an interest in performing music. Me and my next door neighbour Lock Jaw, who is featured on the B-side of my first single called <em><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3hFrEbtnmt4\">Still Caught Up;</a> W</em>e used just to freestyle on the basketball court, and then one day we decided just to write it all down.\n\nI took it seriously when I got an opportunity at a summer program called <a href=\"http://metronews.ca/voices/backstage-pass/376360/get-schooled-in-chapter-of-toronto-hip-hop-arts-history/\">Fresh Arts</a>. That’s where I met Kardinal Offishall, Jully Black, Marvel, Solitaire, Win-K – basically the whole beginning of the Circle Crew. That’s how I got started.\n\n<strong>Looking at <em><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=18iiUmUAGNE&list=PL94D0D8DA4950BFB1\">The Underground Tapes</a></em> – that album was crazy ahead of its time. It had OC on it, Common, Pharoahe Monch, Xzibit…do you think you got the respect you deserved off that album?</strong>\n\nI do think I got the respect I deserved off that album. Meaning to say that I went gold in Canada – and gold back then meant you had to do 50,000+. We got nominated for a Juno, got nominated for a couple <img class=\"CToWUd a6T alignleft\" tabindex=\"0\" src=\"https://ci4.googleusercontent.com/proxy/vUqRl6i_DDxteifmZjuWzHGCUfpFKmJ897xC7DCgkVGVJYq5V7_2Ex_Kkf8hzSIZLnozVxlAh5nLzoTvAfroZsEt6gCvSbu26RGFROOycjlVHUxIYDbc=s0-d-e1-ft#http://respecta.net/uploads/posts/2009-11/1257561651_frontpk6.jpg\" alt=\"Saukrates\" width=\"276\" height=\"292\" />\n\n<span class=\"im\">of MMVA’s, toured across the country, and even got some US radio play. Also, the quality of the music has lasted the test of time – like I never stop hearing about that album. I think that’s the most important thing to be said about that album. It’s the fact that <em>everything</em> that was done at that time hadn’t been done before by a Canadian MC or producer. So it broke ground and let a lot of cats know that we can do it. You know what I mean? It was a motivational piece, and we got a few cool surprises too like <i>Money Or Love</i> landed on the <em>Boiler Room Soundtrack</em> for example. </span>My friend and brother from another mother, Mick Karen (he’s now head of A&R at Warner Music) helped put out the underground tapes in the US. We did an alternate cover in Canada. You know the American cover of the underground tapes, the comic book cover? <a href=\"https://www.google.ca/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=2&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0CCkQFjAB&url=http%3A%2F%2Fmikeshinoda.com%2F&ei=R7kmVZWdGIWTsAWCpYHgAg&usg=AFQjCNFw6-dVM09XbRNptDC8tZzTfPef3g&sig2=Q50nR9oxqlvEqwErYtGm6g\">Mike Shinoda</a> did that. He did that like three years before Linkin Park blew up. So that record just helped do so many things, on so many levels. I still do off a lot of those songs; people request them. It also got me signed to Def Jam! Once we put that out, and Redman heard <em>Money Or Love</em>, I was on a plane a few days later. It’s amazing how some music can stretch over your lifetime and keep coming back. I think that’s what keeps Paul MaCartney going [laughs].\n\n<strong>What’s your take on the Canadian scene?</strong>\n\nIt has changed a lot, but as much as it’s changed it’s stayed the same. For instance, there have always been hungry MCs out there, and it’s just more popular now. I mean, the internet has changed everything for all lines of business and not just music. So, with that being said the Toronto scene has been able to grow (exponentially) without the help of major labels, which is how we [Canadian artists] used to operate in the past. It almost seems as though it’s come full circle, but there is <em>more</em> exposure now for people who didn’t necessarily have a voice before. Now it is like, you can post something, shoot it with your camera and if it is quality people will find you.\n\n<strong>Let’s talk about your latest release <a href=\"http://smarturl.it/BUYAMANI\"><em>Amani</em></a>.</strong>\n\nWell, for me it’s a breath of fresh air, and another opportunity to put out music under the name Saukrates as an emcee because I’m also a producer. The quality of the music is so high – it feels like I’ve come full circle as I went back to the roots. I'm delivering what people expect from the Saukrates brand. I call it the cool box, like you know when people say don’t put me in a box? Well, I don’t mind being in <em>this</em> box if all I got to do is do what I did in the beginning. So it’s a breath of air for me because it is right back to the basics, and I’ve learnt so since I was seventeen years old, so the lyrics to me feel even more potent. We’re having a good time with it, and the recognition is coming back, it’s like <i>wow</i>. It’s like the Dr Dre phase. You know, I looked up to him and Quincy Jones, and the way they can stay quiet, disappear, then come back like <em>nothing</em> had changed and that’s what this <a href=\"http://smarturl.it/BUYAMANI\"><em>Amani</em> EP</a> represents for me. It’s only the first installation in the Season Two campaign.\n\n<strong>What’s going to be the next installment?</strong>\n<div class=\"adL\">\n\nWell, the next instalment we did was a double-sided single, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmW_b8OEZ6k\"><em>Practice</em></a> and <em>Elixer</em>. The second chapter is on its way [Amani was chapter one]. The features on it are great – Sonreal is back. I always got to call on Kardi, we always find a way to make it work for each other, and you know, we got other producers coming in, carrying the load with me.\n\n<em>*In the clip below, Saukrates discusses his production & feature work.</em>\n\n<iframe src=\"http://www.audiomack.com/embed4-large/aboveaveragehh/saukrates-interview\" width=\"100%\" height=\"250\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe>\n\n<strong>Are you still connected with Gilla House?</strong>\n\nYep! Redman is more of a big brother to me than a business associates. So, even as Def Jam faded for us, Redman and I maintained a family connection – and we genuinely care for each other’s careers. So, we share music, talk shit, and when he comes around, he stays at my home with my family. He hangs with my wife, my son and I,  just having a good time.\n\nGilla House connections that will never go away, we’re a family first!\n\n</div>\n</div>\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaI25TkXFmE",

    "content_html": "It's always interesting to me that when it comes to comic book characters, illustrated stories of their origins are treasured and adorned with monetary value, yet the recorded/documented origins of our own cultural characters often gets the \"blahzay\" treatment. We're going to work on that over the next few weeks.\n\nMany of our younger readers may not be familiar with the backstory of the man they call Busta Rhymes. He's been in the game for, well, as long as I can remember. Before he was co-signing [hot-garbage] processions of love for cocaine, he was – and still is – a beast on the mic. Back before he cut off his dreads, before he made you clap and pass the courvoisier, even before he counted down to Y2K and proclaimed he had you \"all in check\", Busta was on – and popping.\n\nAs one third of the group Leaders Of The New School, alongside Dinco D and Charlie Brown, Busta literally had a career before his career. They'd dropped a single prior to, but <i>really</i> came to notoriety after the release of the song <i>Scenario</i> with Tribe Called Quest, off the legendary <i>Low End Theory</i> album. After the cameo success, the group went on to release their now ironically, and in hindsight aptly titled debut, <i>Future Without A Past</i>. The album spawned a few hits, including <i>Case Of The PTA</i> and <i>Sobb Story</i>.\n\nHowever, the group broke up shortly after their second album <i>T.I.M.E</i>, and acronym for The Inner Mind's Eye. The conflict was pretty commonplace, when looking back at it. Charlie Brown thought of himself as the leader of the group, and there was tension surrounding the spotlight that Busta was clearly commanding. Basically the Destiny's Child effect. The group's infamous <i>straw that broke the camels</i> <i>back</i> was captured by <a href=\"http://youtu.be/WQGZXM_H4cg\">YO MTV Raps! cameras</a>. Needless to say, Busta Rhymes prospered post break-up. The trio reunited briefly on the song <i>Keep It Movin </i>on Busta's solo debut <i>The Coming</i>, but were never heard together on wax again.\n\nWhat they (the trio) left behind is two albums, which actually hold up nicely, for the most part. I thought it would be fitting to showcase some of the hot, often forgotten, shit that Busta dropped during his younger days with the leaders. Consider this exclusive mix a salute to the god!\n\nDo your homework and stay digging!\n\n<iframe src=\"http://www.audiomack.com/embed4-large/aboveaveragehh/busta-rhymes-the-pre-coming-mixtape\" width=\"100%\" height=\"250\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe>",

    "content_html": "Each month, we here at Above Average Hip-Hop sift through all of our submissions and choose one lucky album to review on the site. This month I can across the Summerville, South Carolina, trio Savage Souls. Comprised of Kae G The Original Seed, Fortune the Iron Mic Mangler and DJ Icirus, the crew reminds me of lots of people I like, so I'll try my best to sum it up properly. They sound like a mix of Big Pun, with a side of Chris Rivers, Necro (sans the grossness), Ra The Rugged Man and Canadian group Swollen Members – all lovingly baked together into a plate of hip-hop goodness.\n\nTheir latest EP, which I listened to a few times, is <i>Sword Gang</i> – a 5-track appetizer for their forthcoming EP (more on that later). I have to note it's self-produced by Kae G, which is a good look. Right from the jump, it's a dope listen. The title track establishes the flow, kicking off with a dope sample and some cuts before it just goes off. My personal opinion, the two spitters go hardest on the tracks, <i>Colossus</i> and <i>Beyond Average</i>. The beats are full of dope samples, and compliment the artists very well. They've clearly found a lane that works well for them.\n\nThe main drawback from the project is that it's sonically one-dimensional. If you like it, you'll love it. If you're on the fence, you won't find anything here to sway you; although, I'll admit that I'm slightly ignorant to their full catalogue of work. It would be dope to hear them try some different sound-beds out.\n\nOveralls I like em'. Samples, cuts and a pause-play tape feel that I can't help but have a soft spot for. Savage Souls are dope, and definitely deserve a few spins.\n\n<iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/playlists/84048457&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true\" width=\"100%\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"no\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe>\n\nThe team kicked off a year long initiative to release a total of four EPs that will culminate into a debut album in 2015. <i>Sword Gang </i>was their second, and their forthcoming EP <i>Invasion</i> should be out this summer. you can learn more about them <a href=\"http://savage-souls.com/\">here</a>.",

    "title": "Are Mixtapes Dead, Or Just Diluted?",

    "content_html": "Are mixtapes dead? Yes – well, actually...no. Kind of? I mean, as a format, yes. Handing a copy of your burned cd to someone is essentially the same as a grocery store or bank handing out promotional frisbees at a BBQ. It's a digital game now, yet we hold on to the term for dear life. Why not call them a digital compilation of songs that infringe copyrights, hence this isn't official? That's a generalization, but you get the point!\n\n<em>[preface: I'm referring to mixtapes created by artists, not the coined phrase for consumer bootlegs]</em>\n\nMixtapes have a long history and tradition. It may be hard for younger heads to remember, but they used to be actual tapes – and to top it off they were <em>actually</em> mixed. I'll pause while you compose yourself. You either had an actual DJ mixing actual records together, or there was a pause/play element used for those who didn't have their music on wax or own decks. That eventually evolved into unreleased songs simply being \"arranged\". This evolution gave rise to a breed of DJ that simply arranged and played songs, rather than <em>actual</em> mixing – leading to some confusion about the vital role a skilled DJ can play in the culture. As someone who is obsessed with actual mixing, I kind of think you're missing out by not having your music actually mixed by a real DJ. The barrier to entry, which was pressing vinyl, is now equalized due to the likes of Serato. <strong>No excuses</strong>.\n\nAnyways, I digress. Are mixtapes dead? Well, plenty of artists have either created or lived careers in the circuit, like 50 Cent, Lupe Fiasco, Dipset, and Mac Miller; however, the format is flooded. Sites like DatPiff post like \"a million\" mixtapes a day, many of questionable quality (all around). The only barrier to entry that current exists is that you can record songs – original beats not necessary – and make a cover of some sort. Mixtapes, as far as I can tell, have almost digressed into a collection of songs that artists aren't willing to label as an official EP or album. Of course that's assuming it's even an official tape.\n\nEssentially my point is that the term has become polluted...kind of like the concept that rap and hip-hop aren't the same thing. One of the main elements of hip-hop has been watered down to an extreme, which I find troubling. Maybe it's time to either re-name, re-format or create a barrier to entry into the mixtape game? Maybe force an artist to create a respectable demo/album first? Maybe a stricter curation process?\n\nJust food for though. Let's take a moment and salute actual DJ's who create <em>actual</em> mixtapes – and the next generation of turntable warriors.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eidGlzKMfwg",

    "excerpt": null,
    "content_html": "<blockquote><span class=\"s1\"><span style=\"line-height: normal; -webkit-text-size-adjust: auto; background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0);\">We put songs that we feel strongly about in, essentially, a better position to be heard. </span></span></blockquote>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">Nowadays artists have a sea of options to share their music, including services like Bandcamp and the ever-popular behest that is Soundcloud. Users can upload their songs to a profile, and freely share it across all of their networks with an easy-to-use responsive player; but, not without restrictions. For users to access profile options, and sufficient space to upload a full catalogue, they have to pay. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">Let's face it, being an indie artist isn't easy or cheap. There's the cost of production, studios, mixing, mastering, marketing and so on. That's where one streaming service is stepping in and giving artists a free, attractive option to host their releases. Audiomack, the co-creation of David Ponte and DJBooth.net CEO David Macli, is quickly becoming the go-to choice for industry elite and indie upstarts alike.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">The site gained major juice on the record-breaking front as of late, in fact, they broke Fetty-Wap's infectious <i>Trap Queen</i>. Last week, I had the opportunity to chat with David Ponte, who shared some insight on the service's origins, and its plans for the future.</span></p>\n\n\n<hr />\n<p class=\"p2\"><strong><span class=\"s1\">Thanks for taking the time to talk to me, David!</span></strong></p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">No problem! I am waiting for the internet guy to get our new office connected.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><strong><span class=\"s1\">Where is your new office?</span></strong></p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">New York City (still), in Soho – it's  a new office with a studio. We have rappers and producers coming in regularly, and now we'll have the studio set up for those impromptu business meetings that turn into studio sessions.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><strong><span class=\"s1\">Very cool – so Audiomack becomes something bigger! </span></strong></p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">Exactly, an opportunity work directly with artists on their actual music, then help to proliferate their work online and spread the music to the masses. That’s something in motion now.  </span></p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><strong><span class=\"s1\">Is that something that you guys had in mind from the get-go or is that something that just happened organically?</span></strong></p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">I should mention that my partner is David Macli, CEO of DJBooth.net. We're different companies, but there is obviously a lot of synergy between us. DJ Booth is a hub of music premiers and editorial writing, while we're more of a utility for sharing music; but, as a result of our clear collaboration, we deal directly with artists all the time. The emphasis for moving was first and foremost space, as we're growing, but finding an office with a studio was a factor when we were looking. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">We're pretty lucky we're in a space that used to be a home base for producers like Emile (Kid Cudi) and Johnny Brooklyn (Rick Ross), amongst others. A lot of well-known producers were here and created a lot of big-time songs, so we hope to continue that trend in addition to getting work done.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><strong><span class=\"s1\">What's your background?</span></strong></p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">My work background is in software technology, sales and marketing. That’s where I met all my partners. I continued to do that until the last week of December 2014 – and that's when I transferred to Audiomack full-time.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><strong><span class=\"s1\">Was Audiomack conceived to compliment DJ Booth?</span></strong></p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">No, it wasn't meant to compliment DJ Booth – it was meant to fill a gap in the (hip-hop) on-line music distribution marketplace. Before Audiomack, even before Soundcloud started to get a lot of traction, a <i>lot</i> of artists would use unprofessional file sharing sites to release music, and give away their promotional music and mixtapes. These sites were shady, loaded with irrelevant ads, and generally, were <i>not</i> a great way to present themselves. It was like spending three hours cooking a gourmet meal and then putting it on a paper plate to serve it. So we wanted to make China dinnerware to serve hip-hop on. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><strong><span class=\"s1\">I notice the focus and roots of the service are mainly hip-hop, which is interesting – SoundCloud is more dance.</span></strong></p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">When you're starting out in web properties you need to have a niche market – start small by getting your audience to buy the product and then broaden the field. I listen to hip-hop, rap, and R&B ninety percent of the time, so it's more natural for me to gravitate towards it; although, I'm becoming more interested in other mediums of music.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><strong><span class=\"s1\">With other services charging artists money to gain access to features, such as extra downloads, how have you been able to remain free?</span></strong></p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">We’ve been able to monetize very effectively with appropriate advertising. We felt it would be better to make money that way, rather than to charge for subscription or a premium service. Subsequently, it's helped drive our traffic.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><strong><span class=\"s1\">What have been some of your biggest tracks on Audiomack to date?</span></strong></p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\"><img class=\"alignleft\" src=\"http://ts3.mm.bing.net/th?q=Trap%20Queen%20Fetty%20Wap+album+art\" alt=\"Fetty Wap\" width=\"299\" height=\"300\" />We put songs that we feel strong about in, fundamentally, a better position to be heard. Fetty Wap's <a href=\"https://www.google.ca/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0CCAQyCkwAA&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3Di_kF4zLNKio&ei=xdkvVbrZLdWnyAS_vIDYCg&usg=AFQjCNFQgxnoWieBU1xNXlDgHFudrQJ7LA&sig2=w-WoefKQi-F5xZaCkQrJlg\"><em>Trap Queen</em></a>, for example, which they're saying will be the song of the summer, broke on our site <i>last</i> summer. Jennifer Lopez and Iggy Azalea's <a href=\"https://www.google.ca/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0CCAQyCkwAA&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DnxtIRArhVD4&ei=3dkvVYyXOcGeyASY8YCoAw&usg=AFQjCNHxPVfHQEHqAqFjTpRTq1mzUEQzUw&sig2=ZEa_GeyZ2-4oc17hbW3j_w\"><em>Booty</em></a> remix was a huge record. We've had some great songs break on our service thus far.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><strong><span class=\"s1\">Do you guys censor artists? Do you ever receive complaints?</span></strong></p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">We don't censor artists unless something is ultra malicious, and really, <i>really</i>, offending our users. There was one time I remember, where the Atlanta Police Department hit us up about a project that a user had posted. It turned out that the artist behind the tape, which was climbing the charts, was wanted for murder. They were trying to find information on him. We didn't have any clues to who this guy was and if the tape was his. I hope that he got a fair trial and they got the answers they were looking for [laughs].</span></p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><strong><span class=\"s1\">What is your take on the new streaming service that Jay-Z has come up with?</span></strong></p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">I don't think they're honest with the music community. As far as we know, most of the artists involved (in Tidal) have 360 deals with the biggest labels in the world – such as Universal, Warner, Sony and all the subsidiary labels. They say it’s for the people, but that’s B.S. It's a marketing strategy they are using to get consumers to buy in. The labels will be involved in the streaming and get paid. What's different is the artists get to be a part of the title, which will increase the value and equity of the company. They're not transparent enough, but they don't have to. However, the market is slowing, and not many people twenty-one and under will have the $20 per month (or $240 for the year), when they know that music can be accessed somewhere else for free. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">From what I understand of the service, it has a lot of neat features – so a lot of people will enjoy it. It's just that the way it was presented to the market was flawed.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><strong><span class=\"s1\">Do you see Audiomack as the go-to over other competitors?</span></strong></p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">We hope so! I think we have a lot of upcoming products and enhancements, in addition to our Audiomack premium products we have right now, that are – and will be – addressing the concerns of both artists and fans. Listeners want to stream music for free. Artists want to give music to as many fans as possible and make money to support their art. Our stakeholders are crucial to Audiomack. We want to increase the audience and the amount of artists that use the site – and we're confident we can. We're providing a good product!</span></p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\"> </span></p>",

    "content_html": "The 90's hip-hop sound had a very specific sound/feel to it. It's often duplicated, and many artists claim to be \"bringing it back\"...but it's not that simple. The music we grew up on was driven less by money and overt commercial intervention. It was motivated by the love of the culture. The sound that artists are trying to duplicate is comprised of gritty MPC beats, record pops and above all bars – unadulterated street hip-hop. The kind of shit that you heard on warm summer nights on college radio shows across your respective nation.\n\nEvery once in a while I come across an artist that takes me there, and I consider it my constant duty as a \"curator of the real\" to bring them to your attention. Let me introduce you to East Koast – a Harlem rapper with a super interesting background in the industry. His roots run deep, like Dallas Austin deep (literally). His cousin is Mr. Malik from the famed 90s group <a href=\"http://www.xxlmag.com/news/bloggers/2009/10/flashback-friday-remember-illegal/\">Illegal</a>, and he came up as a background figure in the game, helping in the development of some seminal tracks for the duo – and others. While living in Decatur with Illegal (Malik & Jamal) <em>and</em> the late <a href=\"https://www.google.ca/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0CB4QFjAA&url=http%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FLisa_Lopes&ei=R_I4VdrSH6bPsQSojICoDA&usg=AFQjCNHeFworBiUY_nBgS0uf5TjmsK_1Tg&sig2=nW5Z9pV3ugpQgDcTWjVaQA\">Lisa Left-Eye Lopez</a>, of the trio TLC, East Koast learned first hand about the ins <em>and</em> outs of the game. Yes, you read that last sentence correctly. Left Eye, as he (<a href=\"http://ca.complex.com/music/2012/03/erick-sermon-tells-all-the-stories-behind-his-classic-records-part-1/we-getz-busy\">and others</a>) describe, handled putting the duo (Illegal) together:\n\n<em><img class=\"alignleft\" src=\"http://www.1994hiphop.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/MK-Ultra-400x400.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"313\" height=\"313\" />Lisa Lopez (R.I.P) had the idea to put them (Illegal) together once she had heard from Treach (Naughty By Nature) that Malik was as mature as he (Jamal) was. Malik was a spitter and had won all types of contests in South Carolina where our family is from. Long story short, Left Eye came and picked us up at the waffle house, and we lived in a duplex hotel room for about two weeks before we shopped for a home.  We finally moved into a five-room house with a garage. I stayed downstairs, and Malik's room was right across from Left eye. </em>\n\nCrazy right?\n\nI've been jamming his latest project with Lewis Parker, <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/mk-ultra-operation-hypnosis/id962802428\"><em>MK Ultra (Operation Hypnosis)</em></a>, on repeat all day. It's ten tracks long and features no filler, just straight up hip-hop – seemingly void of time markers. It features 16's from the likes of El Da Sensei, John Robinson and Shabaam Sahdeeq (amongst others). What instantly drew me in was the uniqueness of his voice. His beat selection is perfect. His subject matter varies, and never comes off as forced or dated. Stand out joints for me were <em>L.A to New York</em>, <em>Hustlin Junkie</em> and <em>Superior MC's</em> (with El and Shabaam).\n\nWhen asked about his approach for the album, Eastkoast explained:\n\n<em>\"The approach was rooted around (the concept of) mind control, and how every \"top shelf\" artist has no identity. We thought of society as a whole, and how slavery was swept under the rug – as if it never happened.\"</em>\n\nIn short, I loved this album ... I'm intrigued by him as an artist, and I'll continue to champion his music here. Be sure to follow East Koast on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/eastkoast\">Twitter</a>!\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1ITR_FWcnA\n\nEarly.",

    "content_html": "<blockquote>\n<p class=\"p1\">\"It's just a good feeling sitting in the studio with Vincent and Kelvin...\"</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">– Trugoy, De La Soul</p>\n</blockquote>\nEarlier this month, I received an email from De La Soul [I’m on their mailing list] informing me that they would be putting out their first album in a decade. It’s currently available for preorder on Kickstarter in digital, and physical format – there’s also vinyl for all of the real heads out there. Tiered levels of support come with perks that range in price/sophistication from De La Soul USB keys, shoes, and limited edition shirts to toy shopping with Dove, and savoring a dinner with the group. Needless to say, I’m excited to receive my copy of the album in the mail and review it here for all of you; although, I wish I could’ve afforded the dinner perk.\n\nLast week, I was lucky enough to chat with David Jude Jolicoeur, also known as Trugoy the Dove. He dished on the project itself, the timeline, the process and how he feels about giving up his <em>3 Feet High</em> platinum plaque.\n\nCheck out the whole interview below:\n\n<strong>What made this the right time to return with a new album?</strong>\n\nThings just fell into place. We've never looked at our calendar or looked at our track record and stated \"We need to put out a record or we're slipping in the public eye.\" We've never put out any records that way. When \"we feel a vibe\", we go to it. It's as simple as that.\n\n<b>What initially prompted you guys to go completely independent?</b>\n\nWhen we were released from our contract back in 2005, it was the most liberating thing ever – not being tied to any corporation, company or label just felt right. I think from that point on, we decided never to partner up with some other entity like we'd done in the past. Over the years, we've been offered the chance to sit down and talk about deals (label, distribution & production); however, nothing was ever really felt right, in all honestly. It isn’t to say that we wouldn't take anything shortly, but for now we're comfortable.\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\"><b><a href=\"http://aboveaveragehiphop.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/delasoul2.png\"><img class=\"alignleft wp-image-1669\" src=\"http://aboveaveragehiphop.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/delasoul2.png\" alt=\"delasoul2\" width=\"278\" height=\"454\" /></a></b></span></p>\n<strong>What made you chose KickStarter to do this project?</strong>\n\nIt was something that was floating around in conversation for a long time. Maybe three years ago a friend of ours mentioned it to us. He was like: \"You guys should check it out, it's a cool place to get funding – the fans who are in love with you guys will back you\". Over the last little while, there have been some large projects/people on the platform, like Spike Lee and most recently TLC. It just became one of those things that came up over and over again – and then we did some investigation and decided this was something we wanted to go for. We didn't have any preconceived ideas of how it would perform.\n\n<strong>Were you surprised by the responses that you got pretty quickly?</strong>\n\nYes! That was overwhelming, we did not anticipate it happening that fast – it was nice to see that, and it felt good! It gives you confirmation that the people have faith in what you're doing. The appreciation was an incredible motivation to get this project going. It was a good thing.\n\n<strong>How far along are you in the process?</strong>\n\nWe're at the stage of recording music and completing some songs. We're still digging into the hundreds of hours of source music we have – but at this point we have like six/seven songs performed. It's midway, and hopefully we'll be able to finish a lot of the recording in the next three weeks, with possible tweaking in the next month and a half.\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>You mention the artists you've collaborated with (or going to) on your KickStarter page. Are there any others you’re willing to share with us </b></span></p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">I wish I could. There were a lot of songs that called for a  particular voice or artist. So we'd kick around ideas like: \"We'd love to have Willie Nelson on this one or Raekwon of Wu Tang on that one\". There are a couple of those – we just don't want to spoil it until we receive a complete confirmation. We don't want to talk ahead of ourselves, but I will say it's a diverse cast. I mean we already have David Byrne of Talking Heads, for example, who blessed us. Also, 2 Chains. He came on board and did some amazing work. I think we’re going to recruit some more people we respect to come on board and do some great collaborations with us. But to speak of it now. Well, I'd prefer not to spoil it, especially if it doesn't happen the way it's supposed to.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>Did you guys come up with the rewards together?</b></span></p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">Yeah, we did. We have an incredible team working alongside us. We all sat down and thought about these rewards. They’re cool because we tried to make them accessible to the everyday person, as well as add some cool premium stuff that we thought people would love to have if they could afford it. We sat down and tried to think of things we could offer fans who just want to get something and be a part of the process, without having to think about getting banged over the head for hundreds of dollars. We tried to get creative – some of them are a little out of our comfort zone, but I think it's cool stuff that people would like to do. I enjoy toy shopping, and I would love to spend the day going out toy shopping. If somebody equally enjoys it, I'm up for it [laughs]. We do as much as we can to get everybody involved and not feel like it's out of their reach.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>I think toy shopping was one of the rewards that went quickly. The one that was the craziest though is you give your actual platinum plaque.</b></span></p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">Oh yeah! </span></p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>Were you surprised that one got snapped up?</b></span></p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">I was surprised, but I mean, I knew that a fan would want it obviously. Because it's dear to me, our team thought that it [$10,000] was a great price point. Did I think anyone was going to be able to afford it or would want it? No, but it’s a blessing that somebody wanted it that bad. I'm honored to have a fan that dedicated.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>Lastly, its been 26 years since <em>3 Feet High</em> – so what keeps you guys motivated? What's your driving factor?</b></span></p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">The idea of creating new music that's the bottom line. We take breaks because we just don’t feel like doing anything, not because we break up or anything like that. It's not like we continue this hip-hop thing for the sole purpose of making money; although, we earn a living and are actively supporting our families with this music. It's just a good feeling sitting in the studio with Vincent and Kelvin – this is why I started this. They're honestly my best friends, and we connect like no other. I couldn't  replace them and without these two I could not get [metaphorically] high. That’s what gets us going, whether it's sitting down and designing sneakers together, toys, or possibly shortly writing a book and directing a movie. It's just the idea of the three of us coming together and the way we connect and begin to create – it's an awesome feeling and I think that's why we're still here.</span></p>\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8t08zWBKyg",

It's 13 tracks, and has dope features from some industry heavyweights like Melanie Fiona, Rick Ross and more; although, It also doesn't leave any comfort zones – or really innovate in any way. What is does deliver is bars, dope production, and a reminder of what made us love him in the first place.   </span></div>\n<div style=\"text-decoration: -webkit-letterpress;\"><span style=\"-webkit-text-size-adjust: auto; background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0);\">\n</span></div>\n<div style=\"text-decoration: -webkit-letterpress;\"><span style=\"-webkit-text-size-adjust: auto; background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0);\">Right out of the gate, Rae sounds as hungry as ever – as does Ghost, who is featured on the first joint, <i>4 In The Mornin</i>g. He pretty much just knocks em' out from there. <i>I Got Money</i> with A$AP Rocky, <i>Wall To Wall</i> with French Montana, the infectious <i>F.I.L.A World</i> with 2 Chainz all bang. Even the inevitable female focused joint with Estelle comes off nice. Standouts for me were <i>Nautilus</i> and the retrospective <i>Heated Nights.</i></span></div>\n<div style=\"text-decoration: -webkit-letterpress;\"><span style=\"-webkit-text-size-adjust: auto; background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0);\">\n</span></div>\n<div style=\"text-decoration: -webkit-letterpress;\"><span style=\"-webkit-text-size-adjust: auto; background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0);\">This doesn't play out as an album that will necessarily win Rae any awards or new fans; not that it matters. Rae has a (large) dedicated fan base. This album will keep them all happy. Listen, some \"street\" artists wear thin over the years, but some artists can just never do wrong. The whole Wu has that ability, Kool G Rap has that ability – and as a solo artist, Rae has that appeal in my opinion. If he and ghost were 90 years old and STILL rapping about coke, money and retrospective street shit, I'd <i>totally</i> rock with it. </span></div>\n<div style=\"text-decoration: -webkit-letterpress;\"><span style=\"-webkit-text-size-adjust: auto; background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0);\">\n</span></div>\n<div style=\"text-decoration: -webkit-letterpress;\"><span style=\"-webkit-text-size-adjust: auto; background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0);\">This album is a must listen for all Wu and Chef fans. It's fitting that he drops some quality music for the summer leading up the 20th anniversary of his \"street-hop\" blueprint Only Built For Cuban Linx. He sounds fresh as ever.</span></div>\n<div style=\"text-decoration: -webkit-letterpress;\"><span style=\"-webkit-text-size-adjust: auto; background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0);\">\n</span></div>\nhttp://youtu.be/jos6YQONviY",

    "content_html": "This past weekend marked the 20th anniversary of the classic album Sittin' On Chrome by Masta Ace Incorporated – a short lived group formed by Masta Ace shortly after the release of his debut album. To help put the album into context historically, this album dropped a year after Crooklyn Dodgers.\n\nAce first came to prominence with the Juice Crew in 1988 when they dropped The <i>Symphony</i>. It's still regarded as the blueprint for a perfect posse cut. He dropped his debut solo album in 1990, and two later formed INC.\n\nThe group itself consisted of Masta Ace, Paula Perry, Lord Digga, Leschea and Eyceurokk. <i>Sittin On Chrome </i>was their sophomore release; their debut album <i>Slaughtahouse</i> had dropped 2 years prior. Even though it had some serious heat rocks, like<i> I.N.C Ride</i>, <i>Born To Roll </i>and the title track, the album didn't quite \"pop\". Amidst disagreements between Ace and, <i>well</i>, everyone in the group except Leschea, the group broke up in 1996.\n\nAce was – for all intensive purposes – ghost until just after the turn of the century. He dropped <i>Disposable Arts </i>and has been buzzing in the scene ever since (with a new project every 3-4 year habit). As of late, you catch him on tour with <a href=\"https://twitter.com/emccrew\">eMC</a> in promotion of their upcoming album.\n\nWe thought we'd take a few minutes and pay tribute to a solid piece of hip-hop history – an album that will always have a spot on my playlist.\n\nCheck out this ZULU North Radio mix.\n\n<iframe src=\"http://www.audiomack.com/embed4/aboveaveragehh/still-sittin-on-chrome-20-years-later\" width=\"100%\" height=\"110\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe>",

    "content_html": "Every month, we here at Above Average Hip-Hop choose one unsigned artist to profile/review. This month I was put on to a young brother by the name of Kid Cubicle hailing from New Jersey. His latest release, <i>Mind The Gap</i>, hit the interwebs a month ago and really deserves some more shine.\n\nWith obvious influences from movies and English culture (among a whack of other stuff), this album has a certain thing that's hard to put my finger on. It's introspective, lyrical, personal and extroverted all at the same time. From the deep <span style=\"line-height: normal; -webkit-text-size-adjust: auto; background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0);\"><i>Monsters in the Attic</i>, in which he discusses his battle with anxiety and hypochondriasis, to the jazzy straight-up 90's hip-hop vibe of <i>Just Getting Started, </i>it's a straight up interesting listen.</span>\n\n<span style=\"line-height: normal; -webkit-text-size-adjust: auto;\">We wanted to learn more about Kid Cubicle, so we sat with him and asked him a few questions.</span>\n\n<strong>How did you get into music?</strong>\n\nI grew up in a house with 10 people in it, so music of <i>all</i> genres was always playing. I got into hip hop as a kid because my pops was trying to be a DJ, so he had basically every dope CD from the 90s. As a really little kid, I'd steal all his CDs and just listen to them. From <i>It was Writte</i>n and <i>Ready to Di</i>e to Fu Schnickens and SWV [laughs]. I got my start in music without really thinking about it. My high school friends and I would just battle, and do shitty competitions in people's basements. I did that throughout high school and got good enough to battle at different colleges in the North Jersey/NY area. I joined a hip hop band 2 years after that, called the \"Sly Fox Gentlemen's Club\". We did a bunch of shows in NY and were pretty awesome. We broke up pretty quickly and I went solo.\n\n<strong>Who are your influences?</strong>\n\nMy influences from a <i>rap</i> perspective would be: Kanye, Mos Def, Andre 3K, Eminem and Jay-Z. My biggest influence would probably be Residente from the Puerto Rican rap band named \"Calle 13\". They started out as a Reggaeton band, but weren't afraid of experimenting with different sounds, and that's something I really try to strive for. To not be afraid of doing new/different things even if it doesn't always work.  I'm influenced by all kinds of other music too, from jazz, blues, shit from the 60s, alternative and indie bands — I try to draw from all of that. I'm also equally as influenced by movies as I am by music, so that's why I'm always making pop culture/movie references in my raps a lot of the time. Ideally, I'd like my songs to feel like movies in your head when you listen to them.\n\n<strong>Tell me about your new album... How long did take to record? What was your process like?</strong>\n\nThis album took way too fucking long to make [laughs]. I started working on it 2012, but took a break to focus on school. I started writing the album again in London; that's where I got the idea for the title of the album <i>Mind the Gap. </i>When you take the Subway there they always say \"Mind the Gap\" because there's a huge gap between the train and the platform... I guess a lot of people fall or something. The name stuck with me. The album wrestles with growing up, and overcoming the fear that comes along with that. The main producer I worked with on this album was my homie Kevin Birk, who was the guy who put together that band I was in for a few months back in '09. He's a classically trained musician who makes some fucking crazy ass beats..so good. Sidebar: <i>Mind the Gap</i> is also a perfect album name because I used to work at the Gap [laughs] on some Kanye <i>Spaceship </i>shit.\n\n<strong>What's up next for you?</strong>\n\nWhat's next? I'm working with a really good filmmaker from Puerto Rico to shoot a video for <i>I Don't Need to Rap</i> in a few weeks. I'm also trying to get my grandfather in that video, which would make it the illest video ever. Now that the record is done, I'd like to get back to doing shows in and around the NY area... It's been a while and I'm excited to finally perform these songs that I've been locked away working on (off and on) for so long.\n\n<strong>What are your fave albums ever?</strong>\n\nAhhhhhh man, that's tough! Favorite albums ever off the top: <i>College Dropout</i>, <i>Marshall Mathers LP</i>, <i>MultiViral</i> (by Calle 13), <i>Rage Against the Machine</i>, <i>The Love Below</i>, <i>Black on Both Sides</i>, <i>The Blueprint </i>and any salsa record from Willie Colon and Hector levoe.\n\n<strong> What's your take on the indie scene?</strong>\n\nThe indie scene is <i>everything</i> now. I'm not even sure if there is a \"major\" scene anymore. There's a crazy amount of really talented people doing awesome shit (I can't even keep track) – and (now) they actually have a shot at building audiences and reaching people, which is really cool. I'm not one of those artists who gets mad when it seems like everyone raps now... That's fine, I want everyone to rap! [laughs] Not <i>really</i>, but I feel like if someone is compelled to make music, rap, or any kind of art, and they do it from an authentic and real place, then I fuck with it. I don't have to like their art or be a fan of it, but I applaud their effort, because I know it's not easy to put yourself out there.\n\n<hr />\n\nCheck out Kid Cubicle's <i>Mind The Gap</i> album below!\n\n<iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/playlists/94182985&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true\" width=\"100%\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"no\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe>",

    "content_html": "On Halloween-eve 2001, <a href=\"https://youtu.be/A17H7TWgaBs\">Farewell Fondle 'Em</a> dropped and signalled the end of an era. Fondle 'Em, owned and operated by Bobbito Garcia (of Stretch Armstrong Show fame), dropped a series of vinyl-only gems between 1995 and 2001. A lot of artists and labels claim to be underground hip-hop [air quotation], but this was the real deal. Some of the rawest hip-hop ever pressed. Alongside a few other labels, like Rawkus, it helped to sketch out the blueprint of how the sub-genre should look and sound.\n\n<a href=\"http://aboveaveragehiphop.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/IMG_5490.jpg\"><img class=\"alignleft size-medium\" title=\"\" src=\"http://aboveaveragehiphop.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/IMG_5490.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"109\" height=\"170\" /></a> Stretch and Bobbito fans will understand the organic nature of the labels origins. The show – noted for breaking many legendary acts – was receiving demos from everyone and their mother. Whether or not they considered themselves as such at the time, they were curators who helped shape the golden era New York scene. A large portion of the dopeness they got their hands on came from unsigned acts. Bobbito saw the opportunity to provide an outlet and the rest was history. What started as kind of a joke, ended up a vastly curated catalogue of rare, and highly collectable, hip-hop artifacts that capture the sounds, sights and overall state of mind of the 90's underground scene in the big apple.\n\nSome of the more notable records (from my perspective) that dropped on the label were: MF DOOM's classic debut <i><a href=\"https://youtu.be/TSMgjBbmjWk\">Operation Doomsday</a></i>, The Juggaknots' <i><a href=\"https://youtu.be/g_hCDufetU4\">Clear Blue Skies EP</a></i>, Siah and Yeshua Dapo's <i><a href=\"https://youtu.be/R2eYS5c0ZXA\">The Visualz EP</a></i> and Kool Keith & Godfather Don's <i><a href=\"https://youtu.be/O5U7ux9JzOY\">Cenobites LP</a></i>. The label also dropped LOTS of crazy 12\" joints, like the Cage's <i><a href=\"https://youtu.be/Ir4n_-AaZT4\">Agent Orange</a></i>. Another dope bonus: Bobbito himself <a href=\"https://youtu.be/v3f35ah20-I\">dropped random bars</a> all over the catalogue.\n\nThe label never dropped anything that wasn't dope. Nothing but straight goods. In fact, many of the artists who started the label branched out to other indies (like Def Jux for example) and enjoyed careers after Bobbito closed the label's doors. If you fancy yourself a hip-hop head – especially if you're new to Fondle 'Em – I urge you to explore the label's catalogue. I've taken the liberty of compiling (the bulk of) it for you, because Hip-Hop.\n\nBe sure to check for the Stretch & Bobbito <i><a href=\"http://www.stretchandbobbito.com/\">Radio That Changed Lives</a></i> documentary dropping this August, which will undoubtedly explore the label in more detail.\n\n<iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/videoseries?list=PLtfOw2sNYUoAuXWX5eJE85SF8zyKH8TSu\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe>",

    "excerpt": null,
    "content_html": "Tensions between record labels and music artists have existed since, well, the beginning of the music industry. Hip-Hop didn't begin with commercial aspirations, so when big business stepped it, many of the genre’s architects were taken advantage of, while record executives made obscene coin off of the growing \"fad\"; however, many artists caught on to the game, got the knowledge of self and took their music (and business) into their own hands.\n\nThe growing acumen of our culture started to inevitably leak into the music, producing a roadmap of cautionary tales about bogus contracts, and the reality of the other side of the fence. The dominance – and overt shadiness – of record labels continues to exist today. The machine has become more efficient, thanks to the Internet, and can now make (or break) artists in a matter of weeks – just look at Bobby Schmurda.\n\nHere’s a look back at five classic records that put the spotlight on industry misconduct.\n\n<strong>GZA - <em>Labels</em></strong>\n\n<em>\"Slave of a mental death MC don't panic – throw that A&R nigga off the boat in the Atlantic…”</em>\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iFQekXk7CYo\n\nBy this point in his career, GZA had already been involved in the machine, and obviously had formed some strong options in the face of Rap becoming more commercial. On the this gem off of his critically acclaimed Liquid Sword LP, the brainiac of the clan essentially shits on A&R’s – and industry suits alike – by clever flipping all the label names. He spared nobody.\n\n<strong>3rd Bass ft MF Doom - <em>Gas Face</em></strong>\n\n<em>\"Put you on tour, put your record on wax (\"Trust me!\"), Sign your life on the X, you exit, x-off, but what you really get: a box of Newports, and Puma sweats…”</em>\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYp28tEAVvs\n\n3rd Bass was anything but corny. They ushered in a whole new wave of dope artists, such as KMD (MF Doom) and are also credited (Mc Serch anyways) with introducing Nas to the industry. They kept it all the way real, and in this classic record, they dropped bombs on shady industry heads and bum rappers alike.\n\n<strong>Ice Cube - <em>Record Label Pimpin'</em></strong>\n\n<em>\"Just to pimp young b-boys with a cup full of yak, studio contact, a maniac with a contract... turn up the bass and the motherfuckin' treble – about to do a deal with the devil for my vocal level…”</em>\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYB3EPftuFw\n\nwhen it comes to anti-industry rhetoric, no rapper went against the grain more than Ice-Cube. Whether he was shitting on the dichotomy of the (then) current radio hierarchy, or hip-hop's opposition, Cube always did so with a \"fuck you\" and smile. Don’t let the kids movies fool you, he was a gangster!\n\n<strong>RA The Rugged Man - <em>Every Record Label Sucks Dick</em></strong>\n\n<em>\"Now how can the musicians be the scholars – when they're making less than four percent of six dollars?”</em>\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5XSm0s4S-8\n\nRA is so incredibly dope it’s sickening. If his flow reminds of lots of people, it’s no accident. He’s an extremely influential (and copied) figure in the game. He was in the right time pocket, and circle, but refused to play the game – because hip-hop. He is a veteran who has a solid fan base that rock with him to this day. In this classic joint, he basically sets fire to the industry, much like the townspeople did to witches in the 1700’s.\n\n<strong>A Tribe Called Quest ft Brand Nubian - <em>Show Business</em></strong>\n\n<em>\"Let me tell you 'bout the snakes, the fakes, the lies, the highs, at all of these industry shing-dings…\"</em>\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zflDclWNiOg\n\nA Tribe Called Quest are no strangers to the rodeo. They’re the ones who coined the term industry rule 4080 for god sakes. In this joint with a godly line-up that includes Brand Nubians and Diamond D, they talk about industry bullshit and rappers who fail to avoid pitfalls. Consider it a peek behind the curtain, smoke and mirrors.\n\n<hr />\n\nRunner Up:\n\n<strong>Cenobites - <em>How You Get A Record Deal</em></strong>\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQcXP9YhC-4\n\nThis into of this song is pretty clear on how The Cenobites, aka Kool Keith and Godfather Don, feel about music industry execs.\n\n<hr />",

Well, he's worked (in various capacities) with artists such as Nas, Lloyd, Mario, Eve, and Jill Scott, just to name a few. His new album, <i>STS x RJD2</i>, which is exactly what it sounds like, is admittedly my first introduction to him. Good first impression.</span>\n\n<span style=\"line-height: normal; -webkit-text-size-adjust: auto; background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0);\">I knew he was from Philly, but wasn't that shocked to hear that he was born/raised in Atlanta. He has a southern twang that at times puts me in mind of Andre 3000 – but his delivery is very east coast. This 12 shot album is a lot of things: melodic, soulful and <i>surprisingly</i> bar heavy.</span>\n\n<span style=\"line-height: normal; -webkit-text-size-adjust: auto; background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0);\">Some immediate tracks that jump out at me after my first few listens are the soulful <i>Doin It Right</i>, which starts the project off, the super clever <i>Trunk Of My Computer</i> and of course the track that brought STS to my attention originally <i>420</i>. What really impressed me was the album closer <i>Fuck With That</i>, which is a flip of Jay-Z's pre-fame gem <i>I Can't Get With That</i>.</span>\n\n<span style=\"line-height: normal; -webkit-text-size-adjust: auto; background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0);\">RJD2 is amazingly talented, with a track record of critically acclaimed heat rocks. STS definitely benefits from working exclusively with one producer. The project has a consistent tone/sound that maintains its momentum from top to bottom. The result is an album that isn't a chore to listen to in its entirety.</span>\n\n<span style=\"line-height: normal; -webkit-text-size-adjust: auto; background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0);\">STS and RJD2 have put together one of, in all honesty, the best projects I've heard this year [so far]. Tons of replay value. Highly recommended.</span>\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V7NVtHwRYI",

    "content_html": "After announcing that he was in home hospice care on his website on May 1st, blues legend Riley \"BB\" King passed away peacefully this past weekend. He will – and should – be remembered for not only is godlike command of a guitar, but also his tireless work effort. To say that had truly given his life to his craft would be an extreme understatement. In fact, up until last October, he was still actively touring. He graced loving fans with almost 300+ shows a year, which is a tall order even for industry pups.\n\nIn a sea of tributes that, alongside the upcoming biopic, will tell an in-depth story of his life and times, I thought I'd use our Samples series as an opportunity to look at one of his timeless songs that will forever live on through the spirit of hip-hop.\n\nLet's drop the needle into the vinyl shall we?\n\nThe year was 1970, and BB dropped <i>Indianola Mississippi Seeds</i>, his eighth studio album. Aside from being critically hailed as the greatest blues crossover album of all time, Riley himself had mentioned many times that he considered the album to be his greatest artistic achievement – and with his track record, that high praise. The album enjoyed Billboard success, and spawned numerous singles. In this segment I'll be concentrating on the song <i>Chains & Things</i>.\n\nNow if you haven't heard the track, start here. It's incredible; Pieces of a frustrated, introspective man's soul on a record. It's on some blueprint of dope soul music type stuff.\n\nhttp://youtu.be/oQV8omnG6xk\n\nNow for the most notable flips. Now, any real producer who comes across this track will instantly be drawn to the <a href=\"http://youtu.be/Iemxw3va7ts\">breakdown at 3:38</a>. This break/loop can be heard in the following three joints:\n\nG -Unit –<i> The Mechanic</i>\n\nhttp://youtu.be/ucEOnWkC0nk\n\nKendrick Lamar feat. MC Eiht – <i>m.A.A.d City</i>\n\nhttp://youtu.be/icm9quVT0uc\n\nIce Cube – <i>A Bird In Hand</i>\n\nhttp://youtu.be/aqhSOxnGk5s\n\nA few artists rocked the BB Classic a bit different. Most notably, UGK, with an off-the-top loop, and RZA who looped BB's voice for a track off his <i>Bobby Digital 2</i> LP.\n\nUGK – <i>Ain't That A Bitch</i>\n\nhttp://youtu.be/oJyOa8cEvSo\n\nRZA – <i>Can't Lose</i>\n\nhttp://youtu.be/1nhjYGpXK7E\n\n<hr>\n\nBB King was a legend, a visionary and – above all – a true artist. He will be greatly missed.",

    "content_html": "A career in the music industry can go one of two ways: easy or hard. Either you have a Drake “struggle” or you really live that life – and that means every sense of the word. Enter Constant Deviants, the Baltimore duo of M.I. and DJ/Producer CUTT, who have definitely seen ups and downs on the path to their latest release, <i><a href=\"https://six2sixrecords.bandcamp.com/album/avant-garde\">Avant Garde</a></i>, currently available on their own imprint SIX2SIX. Back in 2000, M.I. signed a solo deal with Arista Records, with Cutt aiding in production while solidifying his career as a DJ and engineer. Unfortunately a few snags led the duo to return to the drawing board and ultimately return to their roots.\n\n<a href=\"https://six2sixrecords.bandcamp.com/album/avant-garde\"><img width=\"170\" height=\"170\" alt=\"\" src=\"http://aboveaveragehiphop.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/IMG_5894.jpg\" title=\"\" class=\"size-medium\"></a>I had the pleasure of getting an advance copy of their 2nd full length LP, <i><a href=\"https://six2sixrecords.bandcamp.com/album/avant-garde\">Avant Garde</a></i>, and it was pleasure to listen to. Right from the title cut, the album sets the tone. It’s organic, rough, gritty, polished and reeks of experience. With CUTT handling all of the production himself, the album is coherent sonically, and really brings out the best in M.I., who’s bars shine over my fave joints on the project: <i>M’s for Millennium</i>, which is a clever spin on alphabet raps,<i> I’m Still Up</i>, which is my new late night anthem and <i>It’s Like That</i>, which features the album's sole guest, Aye Wun. Another stand out was the track <i>Breathing</i>’ – a track that put me in the mindset of mid-nineties Beatnuts (production-wise). The album effortlessly carries the 90’s hip-hop aesthetic – right down to the record pops.\n\nWe recently had a chance to talk to the guys about their project, their new movie and more. Check the interview below:\n\n<hr>\n\n<b>Can you start by telling me how guys got involved in music?</b>\n\nM.I. - My whole family are musicians, so I grew up around music. My pops was a jazz musician. He played the trumpet , so I guess the apple didn't fall far from the tree\n\nCUTT - Same here. My father plays piano and guitar. We always had a piano in the house and a decent record collection. I started DJing when I was 11. I always wanted to be involved with music somehow.\n\n<b>How did Constant Deviants come together?</b>\n\nM.I.- We met at a mutual friend's college. CUTT was djing a party and I got on the mic. By the end of the night we were in the studio working on a demo\n\n<b><i><a href=\"https://six2sixrecords.bandcamp.com/album/avant-garde\">Avant Garde</a></i> is your fourth studio album, what's different this time around?</b>\n\nM.I. - I would say that <i>every</i> album is different in essence, because the moment is different, but it's still your classic Constant Deviants music. We did try to bridge the gap from old to new on this one\n\nCUTT - With <i>Avant Garde </i>we had a specific direction we wanted to go in. Bringing the classic era sound into the present.\n\n<b>You guys have been busy lately – tell me about Swiss Banks.</b>\n\nM.I.- That's an album I did wth our Swiss cousins SWC Records. Video director JPowell and I felt it would be a dope project to do a movie for, so it just kind of evolved. We're actually working on our second movie this summer entitled <i>Six to Six</i>. Gotta be versatile.\n\n<b>How was that experience – are you planning any more films?</b>\n\nM.I. - I'm falling in love with making films – like I am with music at this point. I'm living a double life [laughs].\n\n<b>What are your thoughts on the current hip-hop scene?</b>\n\nM.I. - Hip hop is what it has always been. You have mainstream and underground. Me personally, I have respect for both and think it's great for the culture. That's what makes it \"hip hop\".\n\nCUTT - I have no problem with the current scene. Everything is not for everybody. I'm just glad there still is a scene. It gives us an opportunity to do what we do. \n\n<b>What do you guys have coming up?</b>\n\nM.I. - We have another LP in the works entitled <i>L&L</i>. We'll keep that a secret for now! I also have 2 solo projects in the works.\n\nCUTT - Already started working on our new project. Also just wrapped up producing an album titled <i>Groceries</i> for extended Six2Six crew member Aye Wun – a dope MC from Queens, NY. He's featured on the <i>Avant Garde </i>album track called <i>It's Like That</i>.\n\n<b>Any last words or shout outs?\n</b>\n\nM.I. - Shouts to John at UrbanElite, shouts to Shareef Hakim at Black Fist Promotions, shouts to Set Rule at Six2Six Records and everyone involved thus far in helping us move forward. Shouts to people like yourself for the outlet and the opportunity for exposure. \n\nCUTT -  Peace to all who support us.\n\nhttp://youtu.be/RzWJdOCOWto",

    "content_html": "<blockquote>Don't admire thieves... Hey, they don't admire you – their times limited, hard rocks too.\n\n— Slick Rick</blockquote>\nSometimes songs perfectly encapsulate a time, place or sentiment. While driving the other day, a song came up my Spotify Shuffle that I hadn't heard in ages: <i>Hey Young World </i>by Slick Rick. The song was the third single off of Rick's debut album <i>The Great Adventures </i>and – above all – a breath of fresh air.\n\nHip-hop, which began primarily as an answer to gang violence in NYC (no need to argue its actual birthplace), had grown into the central voice of the (urban) people by the mid-late 80's. Although commercial influence had produced artists like Sugar Hill Gang, RUN DMC, Fat Boys – and a host of other artists with lighter subject matter – it also bred the opposite. Artists, like Public Enemy, were using the ghetto CNN to fight issues of race and social injustices; however, there was a gap. Young Slick Rick danced this line, often (but not always) favoring a humorous angle, married with his trademark storytelling flow.\n\nThe average (young) hip-hop head in NYC in the late 80's, early 90's lived through some arguably wild shit. 1989–1993 saw the highest crime rates in the history of the city, teen pregnancy levels were at an all-time high, and the effects of the crack epidemic were everywhere. This was the breeding ground of much of the golden era that hip-hop heads revere so much. It was also during this time that Slick Rick addressed the youth of the time with his classic record.\n\nThe song asked the youth to take make the most of their lives, reject the pressures of the streets, stay away from drugs and violence, and above all respect your parents. It was all done in a manner that didn't reek of cheese, like it might have if, say, Will Smith (or your parents) had made the same song. Slick Rick was relatable. He was one of them. Ironically, the very pressures he tried to steer the youth away from eventually swallowed up seven years of his life. In 1990, Rick shot his cousin and a bystander and spent time in Rikers.\n\nA few songs have tried to recreate the organic magic of this classic, most notably Nas's <i>Impeach The President</i> sampled <a href=\"https://youtu.be/RvVfgvHucRY\">I Can</a>. It would seem, though, that perhaps another <i>Hey Young World</i> is in order – especially considering the current temperament of our society. That young world that Rick was addressing is now grown up (at least physically). Most of us are struggling to bring up children in a whole new digital landscape, fraught with uncertainty, violence and disconnection.\n\nThe problem is; we can't do what Rick did. We aren't one of them. We're the old heads. We have to hope that not all of the voices of the younger generation are one dimensional. Maybe, some of our nagging influence sparks a golden age 2.0 as we venture into the future.\n\nNeed some inspiration?\n\nHere, I'll start:\n\n<i>Hey young world, the world is yours. Fight the power, strive to achieve positivity in all aspects of your life and attempt to stay connected with humans in a disconnected world branded as connected. I know not all of you will choose the \"right\" path, as I learned growing up, that's impossible – but there's no harm in following your heart. Oh, and respect your parents. </i>\n\nI'll leave the logistics and rhyme scheme up to you, but you get the idea.\n\nhttp://youtu.be/ea-ezolZq5k",

    "content_html": "<em><strong>*This piece initially ran on February 18th:</strong></em>\n\n<hr />\n\nBrooklyn is a hip-hop, Mecca. Home to the likes of Notorious B.I.G, the borough has birthed some of the most thorough emcees of our time. This week I'm going to focus on one insanely underrated BK bred emcee, Pumpkinhead. Now known professionally – on the battle circuit – as PH, Pumpkinhead, who got his first break on the Stretch & Bobbito Show, first made noise in 1997 with the single <em>Dynamic</em>. The joint received major mixtape burn thanks to it's Beat Junkies remix, which featured a host of artists including a young Oh No (now known to the world as Jean Grae).\n\nPumpkin released two solo (indie) projects but failed to achieve any mainstream success until his critically acclaimed <em>Orange Moon Over Brooklyn</em> (OMOB), which dropped in 2005 on Soulspazm/Rawkus. The project, which was produced entirely by Marco Polo, was a breath of fresh air, and allowed PH to showcase his skills on a whole other level.\n<blockquote>\"I don't really care whether you order it, purchase it at the local record store, or download it directly to your iPod like I did. All I can say is this - Pumpkinhead's \"Orange Moon Over Brooklyn\" is worth getting by any means necessary.\"\n\n– Steve Juon, Rap Reviews (circa 2006)</blockquote>\nIt's bigger than records, though. PH is noted among the elite in the field of Battle Rap. He won <em>Braggin' Rites</em> in both 1998 and 1999 and made the semis of the <em>Blaze Battles</em> in those same years. With a handful of more classic wins in the turn of the century, PH quickly became one of the biggest names in the New York underground – and eventually became president of the Grind Time New York Division. After a hiatus to tour, PH finally returned to the ring with a classic win over Dizaster, who most notably slaughtered Canibus and faced Philly-rapper Cassidy.\n\nSince <em>OMOB</em>, PH has started his label, released numerous mixtapes, appeared on multiple compilations, released a group album with his Brooklyn Academy crew and continued to actively battle.\n\nIf you slept on PH, it's no problem – because the magic of the Internet can allow you to explore his catalogue. He's an amazing lyricist. If you will, he's a rapper's rapper. I've taken the liberty of compiling some of our fave PH joints below. Give him a spin.\n\n<hr />\n\n<strong>UPDATE 06/10/15</strong>\n\nIn EXTREMELY disheartening news, Pumpkinhead <a href=\"http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/new-york-rapper-pumpkinhead-dead-at-39-20150609#ixzz3cgReA2Vk%20\">died early Tuesday</a> morning at the age of 39. I learned of his passing on Facebook. He was extremely well respected in the underground world, and in my brief interactions with him after I initially wrote this piece, he was a great guy – very humble. Condolences to his family. He lives on through his music.\n<img id=\"GINGER_SOFTWARE_approveWordObject\" src=\"chrome-extension://kdfieneakcjfaiglcfcgkidlkmlijjnh/approveIcon.svg\" alt=\"\" />\n\n<iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/videoseries?list=PLtfOw2sNYUoC3rM1x4o49G4nTuTWbH_I0\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe>",

    "content_html": "Welcome to the jump off of Above Average Hip-Hop – now available in a <a href=\"http://issuu.com/aahiphop\">magazine format</a>. You may have some questions, and I have some answers. First, why are we branching out from our growing website? Well, because of the feedback we've received, and the general acceptance from the community at large. The content is just getting too good, and it felt like it needed to be immortalized in a more artistic and permanent way. Secondly, how will this work? Well, here's an easy answer: I have no idea. I've never made a magazine. I am, however, a writer and a real head who loves to nerd out with my icons and do my part to break new talent.\n\n<span style=\"line-height: 24px;\">The truth is, I've always wanted to make my own magazine, and as a child, I never imagined I'd have the ability (literally – technology is bonkers), or the content at my disposal. So maybe, even though I'm in my early 30's, this magazine is some sort of bucket list checkmark. When I became a member of the Universal Zulu Nation, I did so with the hopes that I'd be able to somehow help spread the culture I love, and help to further document not just the overlooked history, but the new chapters being (physically) written by the next generation.</span>\n\nThis magazine is a physical companion piece to aboveaveragehiphop.com, and I urge you to explore the pieces there as well, as they will often include mixes, videos and other multimedia components that will add further context. I envision this remaining relatively digital, but perhaps becoming available in limited physical edition.\n\nSo let's see where this takes us. Thanks for all the support and love!

    "content_html": "Hip-hop started out in the park; although, as many have debated, it was simultaneously starting across the country under the west coast sun as well. The west coast has given birth to some integral careers in the timeline of hip-hop, especially when we're discussing the (golden era) \"sub-culture\" of alternative hip-hop. Among them, The Pharcyde, Souls Of Mischief, Digital Underground, Jurassic 5 and – of course – Blackalicious.\n\nMy first introduction to Blackalicious, a duo consisting of members Gift Of Gab and Chief Xcel, was <i>Alphabet Aerobics</i>. Over a beat ever<b> </b>increasing in speed, Gab worked his way through the alphabet. It made me not only listen like a hundred times trying to catch all the bars but also led me to discover their debut album <i>NIA</i>. Aside from the album being on NME's <em>101 albums to hear before you die</em>, which I agree with, it was critically praised and etched the duo's name amongst the underground elite.\n\nThe duo released two<b> </b>more studio albums, <i>Blazing Arrow</i> and <i>The Craft</i>, before calling it quits (on wax) indefinitely. Although, there was no real break-up – in fact, they still did a few festivals. Rather, it was just two friends exploring other options. They both released some albums and collaboration before deciding, at the top of 2012, to breath new life into the Blackalicious brand.\n\nTen years after the release of their last studio effort, Blackalicious is back with a new LP, <i><a href=\"http://www.pledgemusic.com/projects/blackalicious\">Imani Vol.1</a></i>. Much in the same vein as some recent artists, the album is available for pre-order on a crowdsourcing platform – and to date is 80% funded. Gift Of Gab, being the humble dude he is, took some time to chat with me about the origins of Blackalicious, his fave artists and why Imani is bigger than just an album title.\n\n<hr />\n\n<b>How did Blackalicious originally get together?</b>\n\nWell, Blackalicious met back in 1987; we went to high school together. We met during economics class, and we discovered that we had a similar passion and a similar vision of how we saw hip hop – and the type of hip hop we wanted to make. From there we started to make music, do little shows, and it began to grow from there. Eventually, Chief Xcel moved to Davis while I was still in LA, and then I moved out back to Davis as well. Over there in Davis I met up with Lyrics Born, DJ Shadow and the rest of the Quannum crew. They made the vision even bigger. All of these young kids had dreams and an idea of the type of music they wanted to put out. The rest is history.\n\n<b>It’s been ten years since the last studio album so what made this the right time for Blackalicious to come back?</b>\n\nYou know, we were never silent. I mean, I put out three solo records, as well as a record with Lateef and The Mighty Underdogs, and an EP with The Mighty Underdogs. Chief Xcel has been working with a soul singer named Ledisi. He's also put out a record with Herve Salters called <i>Burning House</i>, as well as a lot of commercial work. So we haven’t stopped being creative. I think that being brothers, we needed to go out and find ourselves for a minute – and then at the top of 2012 we decided that it was time. We recognized that this is bigger than us, so we needed to do another Blackalicious record. We have always been in contact; we're brothers you know what I mean?\n\n<b>So tell us about <i><a href=\"http://www.pledgemusic.com/projects/blackalicious\">Imani</a> Vol.1</i>.</b>\n\nWell, the name of the album means faith in Swahili. It’s volume one of a three volume series. In the next few years, we’re going to put out three albums. <i><a href=\"http://www.pledgemusic.com/projects/blackalicious\">Imani</a></i>, like all of our albums, pretty much encapsulates where we’re at in our lives and what we’re going through.\n\nThis album really represents faith. There's a lot of things that happen in life that might challenge you. For example, at the top of 2012, I was diagnosed with kidney failure, and through it all, we’ve recorded an album and we’ve toured. I just got back from Europe in February and I’m still on dialysis, so I’m still looking for a kidney. So you know, that was the huge part of it for me, because when my kidneys failed, I thought “wow, what’s going to happen to my career?”\n\nHonestly, I think I’ve strived harder creatively since it's happened. It’s all about faith.\n\n<b>How different is your approach to a Blackalicious album vs. a solo album?</b>\n\nChief Xcel and I have a chemistry. Musically, he thinks the same way I do lyrically – so it's very easy. Once we start going, we get into a zone, and we ride that zone out. With other producers, I have to learn how they make their music, their techniques, their style and adapt to what they’re doing.\n\n<b>You’ve been in the game since the late 80’s, what keeps you guys motivated?</b>\n\nWe're fans of not only hip-hop but music in general. We're always keeping our ears on what's coming out, what’s happening in music and where the music is going. We study everybody, and we study all things music and it keeps us motivated. It keeps us wanting to raise our bar. It keeps us wanting to make albums that will stand out – and I think for us, something like that never gets old.\n\n<b>Why did you guys choose a crowdsourcing platform for selling <em>Imani</em>? </b>\n\nIt’s a different time; it’s the internet era. The way people put records out now, compared to how people put out records in the 90s, is entirely different. There's Instagram, Twitter, Facebook, and so many other ways to put out music. The cool thing about it is that you have direct access to all of your fans worldwide, so I think that makes the situation better for artists who have a fan base.\n\n<b>Absolutely, for example, look at De La Soul. I think they raised over $650 thousand for their new project.</b>\n\nOh, my god that’s some serious change! You could even look at what Nipsey Hussle did; it’s so <i>brilliant</i> putting out a thousand copies of a mixtape, selling them for a hundred each and making a hundred thousand dollars. It’s a good time to be an artist if you got the business part down. It’s a great time to be a creative person.\n\n<b>Are there any new artists that you're feeling right now?</b>\n\nKendrick Lamar, Drake, Homeboy Sandman, Action Bronson...\n\n<b>Nobody has ever said Homeboy Sandman; I <i>love</i> Homeboy Sandman.</b>\n\nHomeboy Sandman is incredible man.\n\n<b>He’s the truth!</b>\n\nYeah! Also, Chance the Rapper. What I like now is there is a variety of underground artists. Five years ago, I wouldn’t have said that It seemed like there was no underground, like everything was one way, everything was mainstream. I feel that there’s a rising underground scene now. Danny Brown, Schoolboy Q... The list goes on, you know?\n\n<b>Here’s the last question for you: I haven’t heard the album in its entirety yet, but I’m assuming that I’ll love it, so when can we expect the next volume?</b>\n\n[laughs] The first volume will be released August 14, and the next volume will be released sometime in 2016.\n\n<b>That’s dope.</b>\n\nYeah, and the third volume will be out before 2018.\n\n<b>Have you already started to work on the next one?</b>\n\nWe've already got the direction for it. We just love making music bro... We <i>love</i> making music.\n\n \n\n<hr />\n\n \n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dK_QLXk6aDk",

    "content_html": "Some artists just keep it real – regardless of social and industry pressures. It can mean the inevitable fall of group's who fail to play ball, so to speak; however some groups and artists thrive, and are able to remain fiercely independent. A few examples that come to mind are RA The Rugged Man, most of the Def Jux roster and – of course – Jedi Mind Tricks.\n\nThe duo of Vinnie Paz and Stoupe the Enemy of Mankind (sans Jus Allah and DJ Kwestion) are back in action with a new album, <i>The Thief and the Fallen</i>. On first skim, an avid JMT listener will notice that the album knocks. It delivers what fans have come to expect from the brand: vicious bars from Vinnie and dope production. \"I don't even rhyme to a beat, I fucking torcher it, like grabbing a butterfly and ripping the wings off of it...\" laments Vinnie on the album opener <i>Poison In The Birthwater</i>. That pretty much sums up the album's energy.\n\nThe album is relatively light on features. Eamon – like the guy who sang <i><a href=\"https://youtu.be/QYwyaCd8MyI\">Fuck It</a></i> back in the day – appears on two joints. RA The Rugged Man joins Vinnie on the bar heavy <i>And God Said To Cain, </i>and Dialted Peoples trade verses with him on <i>The Kingdom That Worshipped The Dead</i>. <i>Hell's Messenger</i> and <i>Merchant Of War</i> are must-listens in my opinion. \n\nThe album is 16 joints long, with an intro and atmospheric interlude included. <i>The Thief and the Fallen</i> is introspective, vicious and has a polished, self aware vibe you only get from vets like Vinnie and company. Definitely worth a spin (or two)!\n\nhttps://youtu.be/xnXtY5_djjI",

    "content_html": "<span style=\"line-height: 24px;\">It's a weird time in the history of hip-hop. The \"next-up\" generation of artists has been bred in a different climate. When you ask them about the old school, they mention names like Nelly and Young Joc – <i>ouch</i>! For this reason, many of the more \"seasoned\" (age wise) tend to, for lack of a better term, hate young hip-hop heads, and a bulk of the ultra-repetitive new brand of trap. Although, there are always exceptions to the rule. </span>\n\nSome of the younger cats happened to have cool parents (like us) that made them explore the culture. The result is artists like Joey Badass and Bishop Nehru, who authentically sound like the golden era. Other new artists just happen to have that \"it\" factor that made audiences fall in love with hip-hop back in the day; above all, they can spit. Two examples of this are A$AP Rocky (and company) and the main subject of this article, Troy Ave.\n\nI've been listening to Troy for a while now. After his recent release, <i>Major Without A Deal</i>, I felt like I needed to get vocal about him, and why he's a good look.\n\nHe's unapologetically hip-hop, very NYC and 100% independent; and <em>real</em> independence isn't something all artists can claim.\n\nRemember his XXL Freshman cipher? He called out everyone else in the line-up for being a bunch of \"weirdos\". Rightfully so. In a sea of skinny jeans and funny accessories, he was rocking a mink and counting a stack of money while the others dropped their verses. How NYC is that? He's flashy, and no gimmicks at the same time. Is he cocky? Yes. Does he tell you that he's bringing NYC back too much, maybe – but that's hip-hop! It's a cocky, competitive landscape. I've seen plenty of journalists bash him for the above two points, but he's continuing to thrive. Don't forget, hip-hop is an underdog sport.\n\nHe has a bit of a 50 sound, but honestly, he's a heavy hip-hop head from New York City. As if he wasn't at all influenced by 50 – he's the right age. He was 17-18 when <em>Get Rich Or Die Trying</em> Dropped. So many rappers have blended other rappers into their style. This criticism of Troy seems especially dated. Mostly because of the actual uniqueness of his voice – and the fact that he doesn't sonically make music like 50. I mean, not any more than Action Bronson sounds like Ghost.\n\nHis new album is worth listening to. His features alone deserve all the attention they get. I mean, hate on the kid all you want. But <i>Major Without A Deal</i> has cameos by Puff and Mase, and some of the hottest 16's I've heard from Cam and Fat Joe in a longtime.\n\nAre all his songs at the peak of originality? Let me answer with another question, are anyone? Look, hip-hop is like <i>The Simpsons</i>, it has lots of writers and over 30+ years has touched on just about everything. Troy knows his roots and is going as hard as he can to rep his city. I've seen lots of journalists who hated on this cat while praising artists like French Montana ( and the like) in the same breath. Stop hating. Apparently not dressing like a hipster and making NYC street hop – with his slant – makes him cliché. All the while, every artist that follows the current wave of similarity is praised for their über creativity.\n\nWeak.\n\nDespite what album sales say (and thanks to bootlegging and streaming they are subjective), his new album is definitely worth some spins. If his new radio single <i>Doo Doo</i> is any indication, he's ready and willing to play ball. That means you're going to be seeing much more of him.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/u91QPSb_WJY",

    "content_html": "There's a certain unwritten formulaic magic that goes into the creation of a certified hip-hop \"anthem\". Making a hit record is hard enough! Hits tend to become forgotten at some point, especially amidst a sea of new hits. Anthems? Those last forever. Few rappers can stake claim to certified, undeniable anthems. Naughty By Nature can (<em>Hip-Hop Hooray</em>), as can M.O.P (<em>Ante Up</em>), and – of course – Harlem's own Black Rob.\n\nBlack Rob has had a career, and life, of incredible highs and humbling lows. In and out of jail at various points, Rob was a Bad Boy Records staple throughout their first two iterations: the Biggie, Lox, 112 era, and the \"Diddy\" era. It was during the latter that we first got the opportunity to get familiar with Rob and experience his epic smash-hit, Whoa. His debut album, <em>Life Story</em>, featured names like JLo (amongst others), and reached Platinum status.\n\nHe released one more album before doing a bid in 2006 that kept him off the streets until 2010 – after which he released his first post-Bad Boy album on Duck Down Records. Unfortunately, the fast life caught up to Rob at the top of the year when he suffered a mild stroke. Luckily, he's recovered and is back at it with a new album.\n\nWe had an opportunity to chat with Rob, who shared his new album, a fond memory of Biggie Smalls and how the stroke changed his outlook on life. Whoa!\n\n<hr />\n\n \n\n<strong>How did you originally get into hip-hop?</strong>\n\nWow… Well, I was fascinated with it from the jump. I started rhyming to myself, and I was nice at it, so I started taking it seriously.\n\n<strong>Can you describe your first time meeting Puffy?</strong>\n\nIt was very interesting. This dude I knew was cool with him from school and took me to him. He asked me to rhyme – and I started rhyming and wouldn’t stop. From there history was in the making!\n\n<strong>It’s been just about 20 years from the first time I heard you on the 112 <em>Come See <strong>Me</strong></em> remix. Now, here you are with your 4th album, Genuine Article. Can you describe this album for us?</strong>\n\nThis album is very special. It’s the element of Hip-Hop that many have been hoping would come back to this industry. Lyrics juxtaposed with that boom bap sound! I speak on some real issues that many can relate too as well.\n\n<strong>The album is unapologetically NEW YORK. What's your take on the current NY scene?</strong>\n\nThat’s what I know and do. Strictly New York flavor. No disrespect to anyone or any other place, but I can only be me and do what I know. Right now – the way I see it – New York is in a good place. It’s coming back to that New York sound, and these days the music is (once again) becoming more about the lyrical content.\n\n<strong>Your 2011 release Game Tested, Streets Approved was released on Duck Down, what prompted the jump to Slimstyle Records for this release?</strong>\n\nThat was a situation my manager Jemal “Jay” Mosley brought to my attention. There was an offer on the table that I felt was very beneficial to me, so I went for it.\n\n<strong>You suffered a stroke at the top of the year. First, how are you feeling? Second, how did that affect your outlook on life?</strong>\n\nI’m good, thanks for asking. It opened my eyes, and let me know that I have to take better care of myself – and face the reality that I can’t do certain things I used to do when I was younger. What people don’t realize is that as an artist, we're on the road a lot and don’t eat or sleep as we should. We eat fast food, party, hit the studio, rinse and repeat. I had to change up my lifestyle.\n\n<strong>May 21st was BIG's birthday. Do you have any fond memories of BIG you'd like to share with our readers?</strong>\n\nI have a few, but I’ll share this with you. One day, I was in the studio with Nas and Biggie doing a song for Mary J Blige. When we started going over our verses, which, by the way, he never wrote anything down on paper, he heard my joint and was like \"yo, B.R. this joint is for Mary.\" I was going so hard on the joint, and he was like, \"lighten up fam.\" That was a good day. I would love to hear that song right now.\n\n<strong>What can you tell us about Quas Amill and Box In One?</strong>\n\nBox In One is my label, along with my manager Jemal Mosley. Quas Amill is a beast – and his album is just about complete. We just have some fine tuning to do with it, and believe me when I tell you: he’s going to shock the world. He’s the reason you’re going to fall (back in) love with Hip-Hop.\n\n<strong>What’s next for Black Rob?</strong>\n\nWell right now, I’m currently filming for the reality show <em>Come Back Kings</em> along with Ed Lover, Mr. Cheeks, Do-It All, Treach, Lil Cease, Jamie O, June Balloon, Rashad, Horace Brown, and a few others. That will be airing on UPN (Channel 9) July 4th, 2015 at 12:30 AM EST.\n\n<strong>Any last words of wisdom for our readers?</strong>\n\nPurchase that Genuine Article album, and tune in to watch Come Back Kings. Take care of your health and be mindful that everything you do today may bite you in the ass tomorrow. Follow me on twitter and IG at @TheRealBlackRob.\n\nhttp://youtube.com/watch?v=OLGdg4EL2nU",

    "content_html": "There have been a mountain of indie artists with songs \"produced\" by Pete Rock on their mixtapes over the past 15 years – and almost as many had songs produced by Dilla. In the case of Pete Rock, many of the beats tend to all lead back to his monumental release, <i><a href=\"https://youtu.be/wV1RWQP-jXs\">PeteStrumentals</a></i>. The album, which turned 15 this year, was part of the Beat Generation Series, released by BBE Records. This groundbreaking series, which launched with Dilla's timeless <i><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLS_s7Q_RBs0EXKxpPBAH82ti-nDXn31PY\">Welcome 2 Detroit</a></i>, also featured projects by the likes of Jazzy Jeff (<i><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLaqtl7KABhyvm-WIZMLQEbKkSa4DBvQRA\">The Magnificent</a></i>), Marly Marl (<i><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLRBu2o2gHu1-4mEGJ-8QWajCBJtW8bjUJ\">Re-entry</a></i>), and more. PeteStrumentals was the second entry in the series.\n\nPeteStrumentals is one of the many reasons that Pete Rock should be on your list of greatest producers in hip-hop history (right up there with Dilla). The songs on the album were originally recorded during the golden era (1990-1995), right in the same pocket of time where he produced joints like <i><a href=\"https://youtu.be/e5PnuIRnJW8\">The World Is Yours</a></i>, <i><a href=\"https://youtu.be/BONgL61snlM\">T.R.O.Y</a></i> and <i><a href=\"https://youtu.be/j_9eAZJloIU\">Shut Em' Down</a></i>. So they definitely have that same stank – so to speak. Today, fans of the original, and a new generation of producers and hip-hop aficionados, can fill their ear holes with Pete's follow-up, <i><a href=\"http://www.mellomusicgroup.com/products/pete-rock-petestrumentals-2-2xlp-gatefold\">PeteStrumentals 2</a></i>.\n\n<img width=\"122\" height=\"170\" alt=\"\" src=\"https://sacvs.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/peterockrecords224.jpg\" title=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-medium\">\n\nUnlike his original entry, this time around there are no vocals at all. This is a purely instrumental effort. Now before rappers start soaking these beats up with spit, please stop and really take this project in. There are a sea of producers out there today. Technology has afforded an extremely lax barrier to entry into the field. Not to get all righteous, but much like the field of photography, the youth these days don't know how easy they have it. This project doesn't miss a beat, like at all.\n\nI remember <a href=\"http://aboveaveragehiphop.com/hip-hop-and-video-games-the-oh-no-interview/\">an interview I had with producer/Rapper Oh No</a> – Madlib's brother and one half of the duo that produced all the music for <i>GTA V</i>. He told me a story about a time he bumped into his longtime friend Dilla at a record shop, and Dilla passed him a beat tape. He described the feeling he had when he first listened to the tape. That feeling, although not as \"exclusive\", is similar  (I assume) to the feeling I got off the rip when I first jammed <i><a href=\"http://www.mellomusicgroup.com/products/pete-rock-petestrumentals-2-2xlp-gatefold\">PeteStrumentals 2</a></i>. It sounds hungry, immediate and above all, the product of tireless digging and sleepless nights. The rapper in me gets restless about halfway through the 4th joint.\n\nAfter 15 years, Pete Rock is, and always will be, my fave producer. This new CD will is a solid milestone in his amazing body of work.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/kWp1LBN82wI",

    "content_html": "Coke Boys, which for the sake of a long-winded explanation is a record label founded by French Montana and incarcerated rapper Max B in 2008, have sure seen some extraordinary ups, and heartbreaking lows over the 7 years. I mean, they are an imprint on both Bad Boy Records and Maybach Music Group – no big deal. They’ve signed chart bullies like Lil Durk, and the late <a title=\"Rapper Chinx Dies At Age 31\" href=\"http://aboveaveragehiphop.com/rapper-chinx-dies-at-age-31/\">Chinx, who was unfortunately murdered late last month</a>. As well, Max B got knocked for conspiracy to commit murder, and is currently serving 20+ years; although, there’s been some rumours he will walk the streets of NYC next year.\n\nOne thing that <i>consistently</i> speaks volumes is the music that French and his associates put out. In particular, I want to focus on their beat selection. They have a track record of flipping 90’s classics and making smash hits that dominate summers at a time. Here are three that particularly stand out to me.\n\n<hr>\n\n<strong>French Montana & Chinx feat Noreaga – <em>Off The Rip</em> produced by Trakformaz</strong>\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXlAmRM_4yY\n\nThis one is a flip of the record <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yt-XSwMNQd4\"><em>Wild For The Night</em></a>, by Flip Mode Squad associate Rampage The Last Boyscout, who is also a cousin of the dungeon dragon himself Busta Rhymes. The track originally appeared on Rampage’s gold selling solo <em>LP <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m2pmHSvKAeo\">Scout's Honor... </a></em>by<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m2pmHSvKAeo\"><em> Way of Blood</em></a>. It stands as perhaps his most recognizable (solo) single; however, Rampage is still active. You can follow him on Twitter. The track also “borrows\" lyrically from Capone N Noreaga’s <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq4j51-OzQg\"><em>Bloody Money</em></a>. Noreaga also appears on the song, and in the video.\n\n<b>Chinx</b><strong> feat French Montana – <em>I’m a Coke Boy</em> produced by Harry Fraud</strong>\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mi0jI40hTOA\n\nThis one is a flip of the classic NYC street record <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFXoe806KGc\"><em>Worldwide</em></a> by Queens rapper – and close Mic Geronimo associate – Royal Flush. The track originally appeared on Flush's 1997 debut album, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PMB2Vboqkhg&list=PLRBu2o2gHu1_3Q9E3ASSxzeG66ZYs_96e\"><em>Ghetto Millionaire</em></a>, which featured production from Buckwild, L.E.S., Da Beatminerz. It also featured the dope b-side record <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usIb05ceGWI\"><em>Iced Down Medallions</em></a>.\n\n<strong>French Montana – <em>Pop That</em> produced by Lee On the Beats</strong>\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X98HX5nbsCI\n\nThis track is a flip of Luke’s first record as a solo artist, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B-fRo5kiZxI\"><em>I </em></a>Wanna<em> Rock</em> aka Doo Doo Brown. Luke has a long dicey <em>and</em> monumental history in the music industry. In fact, he was a catalyst for the <a href=\"https://www.google.ca/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#q=luthur+campbell+war+on+censorship\">censorship wars</a> of rap's infancy. Read up on him, it’s worthy of your time I promise. This song in particular was seen as a pivotal point in Miami Bass, and was released on the heels of the final 2 Live Crew album.\n\n<hr>\n\n \n\nLong live the sample flip! RIP Chinx!",

    "content_html": "<blockquote>\"He who walks his own path of greatness will never be ancient\" – Lil'B</blockquote>\nHip-hop has a bad habit of becoming habitually redundant. I almost liken it to a series of cliques, not unlike the ones you might find in any high-school themed movie. You have your urban-hipsters, backpackers, street rappers, new age and experimental cats and lastly the OG's. Now arrange those all into a circle. See that blank space in the middle? If you can get yourself there, you win aka stand out! Notable \"middle-sitters\", who inevitably become trendsetters <i>and</i> dictate the moulds of the aforementioned groups, include: Kid Cudi, Drake, MF Doom, Dilla, Tribe Called Quest and let's say – for sake of argument – Nas. [editors note: yes yes yes – I left out <b>LOTS</b> of names.]\n\nArtists in the outside circles tend be forgettable and interchangeable. They litter both inboxes and the Daily World Star Hip Hop timeline.\n\nNow, success is wholly subjective; I understand that. But one artist I want to discuss is Lil'B. I'll be first to admit that he's an extremely acquired taste. That's an understatement. I'll also confess that I have been completely obsessed with his phenomenon – and believe me, that word was used on purpose. He is a <i>phenomenon</i>. Assuming my above example stands, Lil'B was in the middle and decided to walk off the field and moonwalk into the locker room. His music is <a href=\"http://youtu.be/APIGP03vAz0\">bafflingly bad</a> at (most) times, and yet <a href=\"http://youtu.be/HqYSQUHpVl8\">momentarily brilliant </a>as, excuse my french, fuck at others! It's as though he <a href=\"http://youtu.be/sJfBV_OQ-T4\">momentarily breaks character</a>, then instantly catches himself and <a href=\"http://youtu.be/GOqrbTlr6SA\">reverts</a>. It's elusive like a Kanye smile at a basketball game.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Y8Zlvv-eNg\n\nEven more confusing is the disconnect between his music and his mantra of peace and love. Especially when you watch <span style=\"text-decoration: line-through;\">shit</span> <a href=\"http://youtu.be/zr9y-yh8Xt8\">videos</a> like this.\n\nIn all honesty, I chocked it up to my age, as I often do when I don't understand the music of today. The kids seemed to get it, and his following, which is <i>rabid</i>, is real the deal. For That reason, I kept giving him the benefit of the doubt, under the assumption that I was just missing something – and you know what, I think I get it now.\n\nLil'B is not an idiot. He's <a href=\"http://youtu.be/NPXGbLrqSGE\">given multiple university lectures</a>, written a book and ultimately been – arguably – the most successful Internet rapper of all time. He had celebrity net-worth of 1.3 million and released so much music that you literally can't fit it all into one iPhone. Interestingly though, he hasn't released any in the past few years, and it's all been free. This means that his appearances and lectures make up a large portion of that fortune.\n\nHe's a walking parody of everything hip-hop has become, yet he's become a symbol. He's a living meme. His music acts as a large billboard that reads free sex – and once you're close enough, you find a smaller sign that read free sex, next to a textbook about tolerance and self-love. How many artists can you describe the way?\n\nExactly.\n\nHate it or love it, Lil'B spends 90% of his time connecting directly with a legion of dedicated fans, promoting nothing but positive (and often hilarious) shit. He also regularly quotes himself and curses NBA players. [sidebar: did you see him on <a href=\"http://byroncrawford.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c558f53ef01b7c79f777b970b-580wi\">ESPN</a>?]\n\nMuch like 2PAC's often name dropped, yet vaguely defined, movement \"Thug Life\", we have to realize fully what the ultimate purpose of Lil'B's act is. I doubt even he knows... But it's intriguing as hell. Hate all you want, but respect his love of what he does, and his ultimate dedication.\n\nPeace.\n\n<hr />\n\n \n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83p69JhDnwU\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDf1_4jm9h0",

    "content_html": "Being in a group isn't easy, and there are plenty of examples of how complex the dynamic can be. Whether it's animosity towards one member, who gets more spotlight, à la Method Man, or an awkward love triangle like City High. Money can – and usually does – change everything.\nWhen it comes to golden era groups, it's hard to ignore the imminent rise of Leaders Of The New School. The trio, which consisted of members Charlie Brown, Dinco D and Busta Rhymes came to prominence after their classic appearance on Tribe Called Quests' <i>Scenario.</i> However, behind the scenes – and in one case in front of cameras – the group seemed to begin unraveling almost immediately. The group left behind two notable albums and was the springboard for Busta's rise into the realm of rap's elite.\n\nLast week, I caught up with 1/3 of the group Dinco D. He shared some insight on the group's break-up, what came next for him and his upcoming album with original Tribe Called Quest member Jarobi.\n\n<b>How did you initially get involved in hip-hop?</b>\n\nGrowing up in NY, it was all around me. Plus, my brother Jazz had a DJ crew – so I would go through all his records and play with his equipment.\n\n<b>How did you meet Charlie and Busta?</b>\n\nWe grew up in the same neighborhood and went to the same school. Brown introduced me to Busta and wanted to form a group. So we begin writing and performing together. The rest is history.\n\n<b>Busta said in an interview with Vlad that he almost left the group before the first album. What was the dynamic like in the group right before it took off?</b>\n\nHe was doing his own thing for a minute and was neglecting what we were building. He would miss important meetings, and not put effort into us as a “group” – so understandably it was a bit frustrating.\n\n<b>What caused the group to split up?</b>\n\nIt was a combination of outside forces and inside forces. You could see people were helping Busta do his own thing, and not supporting Leaders of the New School as a unit. Brown took it hard, cause he formed the group. We worked hard as youngsters to make our dreams a reality, so to have it dismantled quicker than it took us to make it happen was stressful.\n\n<b>Tell us about Dinco after LOTNS. What came next for you?</b>\n\nWell, I moved to ATL. I was promoting parties and working with artists down there. It was a whole different vibe at that point in history; Jermaine Dupri was blowing with So So Def, and Laface –with Dallas Austin and Outkast – was on the rise. They had their families and weren't supporting NY artists that much. So, I came back home and started producing again with my brothers Shamello and Buddha (who made Put Your Hands Where Your Eyes Can See for Busta). We did songs for Mc Lyte, Zhané, Pharcyde and couple other artists. We also did scoring for some films.\n\n<b>Can you tell us about the collaborative project you and Jarobi are working on?</b>\n\nIts called the Leaders Quest Mission, a project we have been brewing for the past year or so. We've always been around each other, and recently started doing songs; it was very organic. It's started sounding better and better, so we decided to make it a full LP.\n\n<b>What else have you been working on lately?</b>\n\nI have a single called \"MeUwe\" coming out with a band called Shinobi Ninja, and a solo project as well. Plus I have some new artists I'm pushing, one of which is Bigg East from Long Island. Also, I do a regular party called Party Flavors (which is a collaboration with Jarobi), and some product branding. I stay busy.\n\n<b>You came up in the golden era, what’s your take on the current hip-hop scene?</b>\n\nIt's cool, not as enjoyable as I wish it were, though. There's so much repetitiveness in terms of style/lyrics, and no real versatility. Still, my heart is in hip hop, and it will never leave my body. So I find something I like and support it as much as I can.\n\n<b>Who are some of your fave artists out right now?</b>\n\nA lot of unknown underground artists – and a select few established ones. It goes up and down daily. No one stands out as an innovative phenomenal mega star.\n\n<b>Can you share one of your fave memories of LOTNS? </b>\n\nThe whole movement was incredible; from being on In Living Color, and Arsenio Hall on my birthday, to chilling with LL in LA.\n\n<b>Any last words you’d like to share with our readers?</b>\n\nCheck me out @DINCOD Instagram and Twitter!",

    "content_html": "<blockquote>I’ll always credit Gang Starr’s Who's Gonna Take The Weight with being the record that made my ears perk up and say \"what ever that is, THAT’S what I wanna do with my life\".\n— El RTNC</blockquote>\nNothing beats a little mystery, especially when it comes to launching a new music artist. Hip-hop has had it's share of \"slow reveals\" over the years. Remember the \"Who Is Cam'Ron\" campaign in the Source magazine pre-<i><a href=\"http://youtu.be/DdiHt1iUIrk\">Confessions of Fire</a></i>? Or how about the \"who is Joe Budden\" debate back when his <a href=\"http://youtu.be/0kT_So0BITQ\">DJ Clue freestyles</a> where starting to raise eyebrows. Keeping people guessing until the grand curtain draw can help build sufficient buzz to presell albums and shows, as well as score deals. Keep in mind though, it's (much) harder to maintain that same level of artistic anonymity in the Internet age... Or is it?\n\nThe most recent mystery/conspiracy in hip-hop was the identity of the Coney Island rhyme spitter, Your Old Droog. His vocal tone had damn near everyone, even industry insiders, <i>convinced</i> it was Nas Esco himself releasing music under a new monicker. When the smoke cleared, that was proven to be untrue; however, that takes nothing away from Droog. His flow was so tight, it was held against Illmatic era Nas – pretty impressive shit.\n\nhttp://youtu.be/TTIHM0bJGwE\n\nLike most heads, I was immediately taken in by Droog for two reasons: his complex rhyme schemes and his captivating production, courtesy of El RTNC. Much like Droog himself, RTNC has a bit of mystery behind him. He gives little away about himself online, and has gone by many monickers over the years: Rich Boogie, R.Thentic, El RTNC & now El 108 RTNC. With the release of his latest beat tape <i><a href=\"https://rtnc.bandcamp.com/album/sam\">Sam</a></i>, which contains many Droog original, I thought I should reach out and learn more about the man behind the beats.\n\nInterview below.\n\n<hr />\n\n<b>How did you get into producing?</b>\n\nThe first record that I ever did was L Fudge’s <i><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HB7VxjE7LVE\">Show Me Your Gratitude</a> </i>(Rawkus). That's the first record I feel comfortable saying I produced. I knew how it \"should\" sound and even ended up giving back the check I was paid for it to go back into the studio to get it “right”… Now at this time, I was still pretty new to making records. In fact, it was my first year right out of high school. I’d have to really fast forward all the way up to my first works with Homeboy Sandman (<i><a href=\"http://youtu.be/utcUKBw7aV0\">Kool Herc: Fertile Crescent</a></i> on Stones Throw) until I actually produced another record that I was confident in. Everything in-between was me learning how to make beats in my own way, instead of trying to sound like Premier or Jay Dee. More importantly, I was taking notes and figuring out how to actually produce a record.\n\n<b>What was the first beat you ever sold? What was the feeling like?</b>\n\nThat would be L Fudge’s <i><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HB7VxjE7LVE\">Show Me Your Gratitude</a>, </i>and then with him again on <i><a href=\"http://youtu.be/s6fpD_kEBvo\">A Conversation With Hop</a></i>. I honour Fudge to this day, because without him opening the door to me when he received his (Rawkus) deal, I don’t think I’d have made it in. I was too new to it all. I had no mentor to teach me the machines, or even how to buy records. I didn’t come from a very musical household, so I was really all on my own with my learning process. Plus, when I did meet people, I didn’t really reach out because I’ve always been shy and didn’t want anyone to even get a hint that I might be wack.\n\nStupidity in hindsight.\n\nI was happy to get a check for what I was doing, but in the early days I was more concerned with getting good. My friend 88 keys talked about being around the greats like Q Tip & Large Professor early in his career – and I can’t lie, I feel so envious at times; however, the “thing” I do now is all a product of my experiences getting here.\n\n<b>How did you originally meet Droog?</b>\n\nA mutual friend of ours called me one day and asked me to listen to a rough he had done to see if I could send him some beats. I did, and droog didn’t really go for them. Instead of accepting rejection, I sent more. 2 full “beat tapes” actually (part of one is on the <a href=\"http://myrtnc.bandcamp.com\">myrtnc.bandcamp.com</a> store under the name <i><a href=\"https://rtnc.bandcamp.com/album/sam\">Sam</a></i>). From there he made the EP. I was at a point where I really didn’t want to do one or two records for people anymore, and I still kind of don’t (with some exception). Rather, I wanted to work on a whole body of work, or better yet, be in a band scenario. The latter came to fruition when <a href=\"http://youtu.be/s55aBLx0wYQ\">DJ Skizz</a> and I added our elements to <i><a href=\"http://youtu.be/6y8rvZ-LKR0\">U 47</a> </i>(I was responsible for the drums) & <i><a href=\"http://youtu.be/ZrS7VC_Uqrs\">You Know What Time It Is</a></i> (I chopped up the loop there).\n\n<b>When everyone thought he was Nas at first, how hard was it for you to keep his identity secret?</b>\n\nThe Nas thing still gets me, because to this day, I don’t hear Nas in Droog’s voice. It's one thing to have a similar vocal tone, heck, that’s biology. But, for people to think it was Nas meant that an elevated standard was being met. Droog is a great artist. He’s creating lines and concepts while just bugging out. You can tell he’s someone that genuinely loves to create. As far as identity, I for one never did <i>anything</i> to keep his identity a secret. Droog's identity was concealed simply because he didn’t care for being on social media. While many flocked to it, he wasn’t interested. He just wanted to make good songs.\n\n<b>You have such an original, underground sound. What/who are some of your inspirations?</b>\n\nPersonally, I don’t think I have an underground sound at all. I think it’s more of a classic rock and jazz sound if anything. On top of that, I don’t think underground even exists anymore. The internet has leveled the playing field. Some months ago, when we released the <i><a href=\"http://youtu.be/bMrzJ-lKQiU\">Kinison</a></i> project, I noticed we were on the DJ Semtex top 5 [ note: THANK YOU SEMTEX] with Drake & Migos. It’s a beautiful time, where young people are just free to create without some of the “rules” I grew up with. The only rule there ought to be is for the music to be awesome.\n\nThat said, I’ll always credit Gang Starr’s <i><a href=\"http://youtu.be/JsFwPDRJeAw\">Who's Gonna Take The Weight</a></i> with being the record that made my ears perk up and say \"what ever that is, THAT’S what I wanna do with my life\". Much later on, Slum Village’s “<a href=\"http://youtu.be/XAy-mPLU-sg\">Beej N Dem</a>” became my own “Dilla Changed My Life” moment. I could go on and on talking about him, but as I’m a sensitive one, I’ll just say that without his work (that touched me so much in his early career), I may have stopped making beats.\n\nTribe & De La are king, but so is Led Zeppelin, Vince Guaraldi, Stereolab, & The Red Hot Chili Peppers to name a few. Q Tip, Pete Rock & Large Professor are high on theproducer list too.\n\n<b>What are you currently working on? Any dope tracks we should be on the lookout for?</b>\n\nAs of late, I’ve started putting out my own beat projects on my bandcamp page (<a href=\"http://rtnc.bandcamp.com\">rtnc.bandcamp.com</a>), because I realized that I was sitting on so many pieces of music. It made no sense to keep them hoarded. When I made them, I knew I wanted to share them – and I'm really happy to be able to do so now. I’ve also gotten the chance to be around some really great artists since the Droog project came out, and some records are definitely in the works but out of a \"jinx fear\", I’ll just say to stay tuned. Oh, but you can look out for <i>The Nicest </i>EP by Your Old Droog coming up in a couple weeks.\n\n<b>Any last words for our readers?</b>\n\n<i>“Follow Your Bliss & Don’t Be Afraid” </i>- Joseph Campbell\n\n<hr />\n\n<iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/playlists/433818&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true\" width=\"100%\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"no\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe>",

    "content_html": "This was going to be a great week. I had spent a portion of my weekend preparing questions and research for an upcoming interview with Hussein Fatal, 1/3 of the Tupac affiliated Outlawz; unfortunately, it wasn't meant to be. Tragically, he was fatally injured in a car collision in Georgia, leaving behind three daughters and many broken hearts. Our interview may not have worked out before he passed, but I felt I needed to complete this piece to introduce the world to his body of work, and his life.\n\nFatal was born/raised in Montclair, New Jersey, and – like many rappers before and after him – was involved in the drug game. His life took a positive turn after being introduced to Tupac Shakur by Yali Kadafi (a friend/collaborator who was also a member of the Outlawz). After some impromptu auditioning, he was officially inducted into the fold. He went on to feature on some of Pac's most notable joints on his double-disc classic <em>All Eyes On Me</em>. Namely: <em><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qthFasUcnBk\">When We Ride</a>,<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tx1Fg0Fmazo\"> All About U</a></em>, and, of course, the infamous<em> <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41qC3w3UUkU\">Hit Em’ Up</a></em>. That album has since has been certified Diamond by the RIAA, which makes it one of the best-selling albums (ever) in the U.S.\n\nTupac, as we all know was tragically gunned down in Vegas at the – in hindsight – unbelievably young age of 26. Fatal wasn't with him that night, as he was home in Jersey for a court date. Shortly after, Ouglaw brethren Yaki (only 19 years old) was also gunned down. Fatal, in the wake of so much loss, quit rap and turned to the street; however, the birth of his first daughter inspired him step back into the game.\n\nHis solo career had a number roadblocks, like a label folding, wack marketing, and incarceration, but he overcame and released 4 solo albums – on top of some collaborative efforts. His journey through the latter part of the 90's and 2000's had layovers on Relativity, Rap-A-Lot and even Murder INC for a short stint. He eventually started his own label, where his catalogue from 2009 onwards currently resides.\n\nHis death is tragic, and with him, we lose another link to the legendary Tupac. Many rap fans, especially younger ones, often tend to name drop Pac in <i>best-of </i>lists, but unless you were experiencing his \"aura\" as it happened, you’ll likely never understand the impact he had on music, and socio-political rhetoric of the time. As well, The Outlawz were a different type of posse. Unlike say Junior Mafia, who were largely ghostwritten by Biggie (and others), they were actual artists. Fatal was a serious artist – with an impressive catalogue. His debut album is a must-listen for sure.\n\nFans continue to mourn, and speculate the mysterious nature of Pac's death. Fatal was often cited amongst the liner notes of the \"conspiracy\", and if Tupac truly is alive in Cuba, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFAJ79Zsnxg\">his coordinates</a> are likely gone with Fatal. I had planned to nerd out with Fatal about his time with Pac, his insights on the game and the future of his label, but sadly I’m instead writing this retrospective.\n\nI think it’s only right to share a collection of his music here with you – and invite you to help his family <a href=\"http://www.gofundme.com/z6j498\">send him off right</a>.\n\nRIP homie\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qthFasUcnBk&list=PLtfOw2sNYUoBUae_ud261Aiikbg8yq55r",

    "content_html": "Success is a one-way street. The hip-hop world is an unforgiving beast. It's almost as though once you pop [à la EPMD <i>Crossover</i>], any \"hip-hop cred\" goes out the window. Such is the case with Black Eyed Peas, arguably one of the more successful, polished – and currently active – \"hip-pop\" crossover groups of the past... Well, ever really. Their audience, though, is far from the backpacker crowd you may find at your local club catching a performance from the likes Joey Badass. Not these days anyways. This wasn't always the case.\n\nIn case you forgot (and you're not alone), or too young to recall the scene at the time, I thought it would be good to take a BEP \"refresher\". Will.I.am and Apl.De.Ap met in '88, and started to write and perform. Before long, joined by a friend named Dante Santiago, and the trio were signing their first deal. After grabbing the attention of Jerry Hellar's nephew, who promptly facilitated a contract with Eazy E's Ruthless Records under the name ATBAN Klann (or A Tribe Beyond a Nation).\n\nhttps://youtu.be/0mVS3WoPtRM\n\nTheir first album <i><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL8C4E1EC883471B78\">Grassroots</a></i> was completed, but ultimately shelved when Easy-E passed away from complications related to AIDS a short month after his diagnosis in 1995. The guys dusted themselves off, replaced their pal Dante with rapper Taboo, and changed their name to the more familiar iteration we all know today. With the new trio in place, they began to work on their brilliant, critically acclaimed official (Interscope Records) debut album, <i><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL31lcUABiWdIAELUByUlGlncQHWT0gBHT\">Behind The Front</a></i>. It was conscious, live – quite literally – and admirably self-aware. In the (commercial) hip-hop climate of 1997, especially in LA amongst a sea of gangsta music, it was a breath of fresh air. The album spawned hits like <i><a href=\"https://youtu.be/-IdctSYjfpQ\">Fallin Up</a></i> and <i><a href=\"https://youtu.be/Rdg1_EMlclo\">Joints & Jams</a></i>. This led to a second album, <i><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL31lcUABiWdIM8Bgb9Yuy83PGYJtP5jpm\">Bridging The Gap</a></i>, which followed much of the same \"style guide\", so to speak. Their next move was the introduction of Fergie, which dramatically shifted their sound, audience and tax brackets. Their third album, <em>Elephunk</em>, was the re-birth of BEP – the one that most parents and people born after 1991 will remember.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/-5x_dmI9e6Y\n\nI think it's important to acknowledge the sans-Fergie trio. Why they aren't mentioned in the same vein as someone like the roots is beyond me. As far as hip-hop bands go, BEP's Behind The Front is a gem that holds up unbelievably well! So take a moment, or two, and explore their older catalogue. We've taken the liberty of cooking up a mix for you to get you started.\n\nDo your homework.\n\n<iframe src=\"http://www.audiomack.com/embed4-large/aboveaveragehh/black-eyed-peas-were-very-hip-hop-in-case-you-forgot\" width=\"100%\" height=\"250\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe>",

    "content_html": "In today's hip-hop climate, where artists are here today and gone tomorrow, terms like classic and legend are grossly overused. Artists from my era had to earn titles through consistency, longevity and – most importantly – building a brand and body of work that stands the test of time. This is a level that includes artists like LL Cool J, Nas and Houston's own Geto Boys.\n\n<a href=\"http://aboveaveragehiphop.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/IMG_7875.jpg\"><img class=\"alignleft size-medium\" title=\"\" src=\"http://aboveaveragehiphop.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/IMG_7875.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"168\" height=\"170\" /></a>Assembled by J. Prince, the mastermind behind the southern powerhouse Rap-A-Lot Records, the group took many forms. Ultimately, the grouping of Scarface, Willie D, and Bushwick Bill, with DJ Ready Red on the boards/decks was the combination that made the most impact. Together, they crafted hits like <i><a href=\"http://youtu.be/IJtHdkyo0hc\">Mind's Playin Tricks On Me</a>, </i>and <i><a href=\"http://youtu.be/24c8i_Oq8P4\">The World is a Ghetto</a> – </i>to name a few.\n\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.5;\">Geto Boys are rightfully credited with putting the south on the (hip-hop) map, and influencing a legion of artists too vast to name. Ten years since their last album, the boys are back on tour and – if fully funded – will release a long-awaited new album. Willie D was kind enough to take some time and discuss the history of the group, the new album and more.Interview below.</span>\n\n<a href=\"http://aboveaveragehiphop.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/IMG_7820.jpg\"><img src=\"http://aboveaveragehiphop.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/IMG_7820.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"100%\" /></a>\n\n<b>How did you originally become a member of the Geto Boys, because before you and Scarface joined the group, Geto Boys were already a group. So, how did you guys get involved with them?</b>\n\nAfter they had released the first album Making Trouble, which met with some original success, J. Prince wanted to take the group in a different direction. He asked me to write a few songs for the new album. I wrote <i><a href=\"https://youtu.be/_DWNsRolVdY\">Let a Hoe Be a Hoe</a></i> and <i><a href=\"http://youtu.be/vqvvxcuugrk\">Do It Like a G.O</a></i>. They were cool with <i>Do It Like a G.O</i>, but they didn’t want to do <i>Let a Hoe Be a Hoe</i> – especially Prince Johnny C. Jukebox got over that, but ultimately he decided that he didn’t want to be in the group anymore once we actually assembled the new line up. He made his mind up on the first day of recording.\n\nLet me back up a little bit. After I wrote the two songs and was given the resistance from Prince Johnny C, J. Prince came to me and asked me to join the group. I emphatically was like, “No – I don’t want to be in a group”. Then he was like, “Well, can you do it as a favor?\" It’s like, how do you turn that down… Somebody that is so invested in your career asks you to do a favor, how do you turn it down? So I joined the group as a favor. I never wanted to be in the group.\n\n<strong>That’s an incredible story.</strong>\n\nYeah! That’s how I got into the group, and that night, the same night that he asked me to be in the group, he came to my house. We stayed up for hours talking about the Geto Boys, and the direction he wanted to take the group in. He told me about this dude Dj Akshen from the south side of town, who everyone knows now as Scarface. He said, “I want to put him in the group, he's cold man!” I trusted Jay; I trusted his insight when it came to music. He had a real good sense of what people liked – so I believed him. So when he said he wanted to put him in the group, I didn’t question it. I didn't meet Scarface until the first day that we were set to go to the studio. He was in a van with J., Ready Red, Raheem, and Jukebox. I met him, and about two hours later, we were in the studio writing music.\n\n<b>Now fast forward, it’s been a long time since Geto Boys came out and it’s been almost a decade since your last album. You guys have gone through ups and downs. Why now?</b>\n\nAll for the fans. Look, we can do our solo things, everybody can have a certain level of success, but there is nothing like a Geto Boys album. There is nothing like hearing all of our three personalities, and the texture of our voices. Each of us may address a particular topic and even though we may come from three entirely different angles, it always fits perfectly – and that's what people like about the Geto Boys. The chemistry.\n\nWhy not now, especially considering all the things that's going on in Ferguson, the things going on in Baltimore, and everything that went on in Oakland. I mean it's just really all over the country… The police brutality. We saw the patrol; they're totally out of control, pushing black folks around and pushing white folks around. They are pushing everybody around. They are pushing anybody around they can. Anybody sitting around defending them is constantly giving them the benefit of the doubt, and automatically jumping on their side every single incident. Some people never give the victim the benefit of the doubt when police brutality is involved. Cops think everything will be cool, and they will be able to do what they're doing, and go unchecked. But that’s not going to happen forever, sooner or later the cops are going to get a taste of their own medicine – and they're going to get it in high doses.\n\n<strong>What made you guys choose Kickstarter as a platform?</strong>\n\nWell the biggest thing about Kickstarter, is that it allows you to cut the middlemen out of the equation. Particularly with the message we want to put out right now; we don’t want to go back and forth with the labels about our content. We’re about to go off, like really go off. If you think about a lot of the music today, it’s very, very tempered.\n\n<strong>Absolutely!</strong>\n\nIt’s very tempered, man. It’s like People are afraid to say what they mean. I was about to say they're scared to speak to their convictions, but many people don’t even have convictions. Everyone wants to be friendly. It’s cool to live in harmony and work in peace, but if peace is not an option, then I think you should set yourself to win a war. Go to war and win. Everybody wants to be politically correct. You got to like everything, or somebody is trying to get your job taken away from you, or someone is attempting to assassinate your character. Anytime you disagree with someone, what’s the first thing people say? You’re just hating. Since when has an opinion become hate?\n\nPeople in America don’t have opinions anymore. You can’t have an opinion. If you have an opinion people, try to take away your life. They just take away your living, they just take away your lifestyle. Ostracize you, that is not cool! So we don’t have to worry really about that. Having endorsements and stuff like that is a bit cool, but then again, a lot of times it limits what you can say\n\n<strong>I don’t know many labels in North America that are going to put a lot of marketing power behind a real message like that.</strong>\n\nThey're not. There is only a tiny percentage of people who work in the majors, who love the music. There used to be a time when people, even if they were at the top of the music chain, they had a passion for the music. Now it seems like it’s just all about the dollar – just strictly about the dollar. Gone are the days when labels would hold an artist and say, “the first album, if we do fifteen thousand that’s cool. After the first album, you want to do quarter a million, and by the third album you go platinum.\" That’s over; now it's like \"how the fuck are you going to sell a million records?\"\n\n<strong>Exactly</strong>.\n\nIt used to be a time when an album meant something, being able to go front to back just play that record on from front to back. You can play the record and walk away you don't have to worry about it. Now it’s as the labels are are selling up as they say “Give me a single.” And they’re putting pressure on the artists to make singles. And the problem with a single is that it’s a just a single. It’s not accompanied by any other compositions that hold weight. It’s a just a single. People don’t even know the titles of albums anymore. They know the titles of singles.\n\n<strong>So right now, how is your relationship, you guys in the group? I know a lot of people feel that you guys don’t get along at all.</strong>\n\nA lot of people are right. We get along from time to time. It’s just that we’ve been around each other for so long, and I do think at times we take each other for granted just like family members do. The main reason we can make music together, and tour together, is because we do have a common denominator being that as \"Geto Boys\". We understand the significance of the brand – and so we constantly come together to add to that legacy. The thing is that as long there is no disrespect involved, I can do this. We can have our disagreements, but disrespect will not be tolerated. So that’s why I give the guys respect because I want my respect. We can have our disagreements and at times, our arguments get very heated. But as long as there is respect involved, then any differences can be worked out.\n\nhttps://www.kickstarter.com/projects/getoboys/geto-boys-new-album-habeas-corpus\n<h1>Update</h1>\nUnfortunately, to the dismay of rap fans worldwide, the Geto Boys album was not fully funded. This has left the future of the group up in the air. Although they continue to tour, Scarface has been quite vocal about the fans being the ultimate deciding factor of the group's fate. In an interview with HipHopDX he said the following:\n\n<em>\"In all honestly, I don't know if that's what the fans wanted,\" Scarface says of the group's failed Kickstarter campaign. \"I feel like if that's what they wanted, then that's what we'd be doing.</em>\n\nDisappointed fans were also quite vocal in the KickStarter's comment section – and many echoed the same sentiment: wtf? With the number of supporters worldwide, and the amazing turnouts to theirs concerts, some point to the lack of awareness this project needed to succeed:\n\n<em>They didn't market this well at all. I'm a huge Geto Boy's fan, but the only reason I heard about it was a post in Facebook by Backspin on XM Radio. I think if they step their social media game up it'd be easy. I hope they give it another go. I'll be in again!!!</em>\n\n<em>Hardly anyone knew about this Kickstarter. It's a shame, but hopefully the guys will do another album </em>some day<em>.</em>\n\n<em>Def not happy to hear this didn't get funded. With all those people showing up to their concerts, I'm sure if everyone backed at least $20 a head, this would easily get funded.</em>\n\nIt's a kick in the groin for fans – the same one's that Willie D described as \"beating their asses\" for new material. Although not grammatically \"all there\", one comment sums up how a lot of us day ones are feeling:\n\n<i style=\"line-height: 1.5;\">Geto Boys are my ultimate favorite group. Before Outkast and the whole southern hip hop scene came to light, there was Scarface, Willie D and Bushwick Bill. I've followed this group since 1989 and have always been a huge admirer of this group. Willie D always made me laugh with his humor, wit and wisdom especially on his solo projects. Bushwick Bill the master of horrorcore, before Gangsta N.I.P. Brotha Lynch hung etc. this brother was always telling some dope stories that I enjoyed so much. And Scarface, the master story teller, master producer and a dope artist. When I first heard both Now I feel ya and I seen a man die..... Wooooo!!! I knew that this brother had a gift. On I seen a man die, I saw this</i><span style=\"line-height: 1.5;\"> brother as the grim reaper of thought. Very dope! I support these brothers and will that they make this new Geto Boys album into a reality. I don't want anyone of them to give up, because there are alot of fans just like myself who desires to hear another Geto Boys album. I support you brothers to the fullest and willing you so much success on all your endeavors. Don't give up! Peace!!</span>",

Just don't perpetrate penmanship in the writers circle.</blockquote>\nIf you have Twitter and are even remotely interested in hip-hop, then you're up on last week's can of worms, which was opened by Meek Mill. Mostly, he accused hip-hop's poster boy du jour, Drake, of not writing his raps. The thought of it was laughable to fans at first. Then, rapper OG Maco followed up by pointing out that a second writer, one Quentin Miller, was credited with at least five songs on the latest album by the Toronto superstar. We all missed it apparently because it's 2015, so most of us don't own physical copies of anything. Funkmaster Flex stepped it up a by procuring what he claims are the actual reference tracks. In fact, a cease he posted to Instagram seems almost to confirm its authenticity. So the question is, is Quentin Miller Drake's \"ghostwriter\"? Well, as Miller describes, no. Rightfully so. He's a paid, credited collaborator, which in essence still means he \"helped write the songs\".\n\nThe blowback from Drake's camp seems to suggest that it's bigger than just rap. Drake is a multifaceted artist – he composes music (like plays instruments and stuff), he changes the game (constantly) and sets trends. Meek Mill is one dimensional in comparison. You know what, I agree to that effect. Drake is a more powerful brand, and all around better artist than Meek. He's more palatable by the masses, of all ages; although, the question stands. Does Drake write his raps? Not his compositions, not the singing on songs like Hold On We're Going Home, but actual \"hip-hop\" rhymes on songs like Energy. The answer is a gray-area apparently. That's the issue.\n\nIt's not unusual, though, I mean have you ever really looked at the credits of your fave album? They are rarely clean and straight forward. Your heart wants to look at Illmatic and see nothing but N. Jones in the writing credits, likewise for Reasonable Doubt, and more recent efforts by the likes of J. Cole and others. I will acknowledge that <span style=\"text-decoration: line-through;\">rappers</span> writers often credit mad people, such as friends and musicians (for various personal and legal reasons), as in the case of Nas, who credits multiple jazz musicians on Illmatic. But others are a bit more suspect and call the actual solo creative process of your fave artists in question.\n\nI mean, if you have lyrics written for you, and it's widely known/accepted, people get over it and just go for the ride – à la Puffy and Dre. You just won't be acknowledged as a \"writer\", which artists like those above are fine with. The problem is though, is that the hip-hop community is über competitive, and the thought that Drake isn't 'shakespearing' his soliloquies is quite off-putting, no matter what average fans feel. The genre of hip-hop has become more of a business than a sub-culture, and there is much more smoke and mirrors that many of you know or can even imagine. It seems inevitable that multi-millionaires who are seemingly detached from the street would enlist hungry up and comers to help them stay fresh.\n\nDoes that make it ok? Well, No.\n\nHip-hop isn't R&B, Rock or any other genre where not writing your shit it is considered \"normal\". I've seen other blogs suggesting that hip-hop was \"born\" when Grandmaster Caz wrote Rapper's Delight, so it shouldn't be so taboo that it still happens today – except that it is. Rapper's delight was a smash hit, but it's a terrible example of artistic mastery in the field of hip-hop. There are plenty of artists who take the time to craft their lyrics – like literally million. Except we don't always champion those artists. The music industry is full of pressures, and often, that means accepting input against your will. Hence, some of your fave artists don't write their shit by themselves. Disappointing huh? Like finding out Santa isn't real right?\n\nI'll broaden this because it's bigger than Drake. It goes for everyone!\n\nThat being said, if you don't write your lyrics, that's fine – but please position yourself accordingly. It's infuriating to actual writers. There's no shame in taking your place alongside (not top-5) eccentric super rich rappers like Dre, Puff (and way more that I'm sure would break my heart to learn about). Just don't perpetrate penmanship in the writer's circle. We don't take kindly to that sort of thing.",

    "content_html": "<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Hip-hop is worldwide – and sometimes it’s easy to get pigeonholed by a local mentality when it comes to the genre. Hip-hop is bigger than the US and Canadian markets, which we are understandably serviced on a regular basis. Specifically, the UK hip-hop market is a sea of creativity and originality. The core of its influence is interesting, as it has elements of golden era legends across two continents, so the subject matter and overall vibe tends to vary vastly. I’ve been thinking of expanding our unsigned hype for a while, but have been (admittedly) intimidated, as I had an entire lifeline of hip-hop to catch up on. Fortunately, a very dope project landed on my desk, so it was as good a time as any to focus on some dope audio candy from London-town. Meet Four4s, the duo of childhood bredrens, Abstrax and Timi RS. They have bars, a very cool underground vibe, and a great new batch of tunes. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Their new LP, <em>4th Kind</em>, is 17 joints long, with no filler/interludes – just bars. They list their influences as Wu-Tang, KRS ONE, Big pun, Nas, Big L, which is actually quite evident as I listened to this album. As much as this project is a melting pot of sounds and styles, it’s all hip-hop –  and benefits from the cohesive sound and feel orchestrated entirely by Abstrax. I'm a <strong>huge</strong> fan of projects with a single producer. When asked to describe their sound, the duo offered the following: \"<em>It's anger, passion, and fun mixed with a touch of sadness at times.</em>” They further describe that their tone/subject matter stems from their views of the current industry on a whole. \"<em>There’s a lot of negativity amongst the youth of today’s world… And artists are taught to become characters molded by the media. Losing our own independent minds, we've become a man made generation.</em>” This project seems devoid of much commercial influence, but is rather a gritty ride-along with two English kids trying to live their dreams in a world where creative minds are often set-up to fail.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">This thought process is all over this project. They tackle everything from the consequences of negative decisions, street life, overcoming adversity, crew love, loss, happiness, stage fright – and overall just some <em>real-life shit</em>. It’s refreshing as hell, in all honesty. The vibe is quite cinematic, with lots of sonic experimentation, ambient sounds and breakdowns. There are a few stand-outs [note: these are just the writer’s fave joints] for me: The album opener <a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/four4smusic/im-home?in=four4smusic/sets/4th-kind\"><em>I’m Home</em></a>, <a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/four4smusic/yeah-to-the-bullshit?in=four4smusic/sets/4th-kind\"><em>Yeah To The Bullshit</em></a>, which illustrates how the duo deals with, well, bullshit, the retrospective <a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/four4smusic/time-in-my-life-ft-tenesan?in=four4smusic/sets/4th-kind\"><em>Time In My Life</em></a> featuring talented singer Tenesan and lastly the slamming <a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/four4smusic/so-strong?in=four4smusic/sets/4th-kind\"><em>So Strong</em></a> (currently on repeat here at the office).  </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><em>4th Kind</em> is the second release from the duo, and I was so impressed by this one, that I’m going to explore their back catalogue a bit more. The project is definitely worth a cover to cover spin – or maybe even two.  </span></p>\nhttps://soundcloud.com/four4smusic/sets/4th-kind",

    "content_html": "You can't stop the leaks – and that's a fact. Many artists over the years have fallen victim to album leaks. Some artists have taken counter measures and simply released their projects early in an attempt to curb potential buyers from grabbing the album for free. Others, unfortunately, weren't so lucky; however, that was then, this is now. In an internet age where we've seen larger scale projects drop with no notice, leaks seem kind of played out. I mean, aside from the fact that artists refer to their own promo tracks as \"leaks\" from upcoming albums, many leaks are calculated marketing schemes hatched by agencies.\n\nSometimes, in some rare occasions, we stumble upon a leak that takes us back to the old days. I'm talking the days when DJ Clue leaked Biggie Smalls on the radio. Last week, it felt that way. Madvillain, which is a duo made of Madlib and MF DOOM, has been hinting at a follow up to their cult classic for years, and last week we finally for a taste of it, from an unlikely source – a 15 year old rapper from Glasgow. Two songs, one called <em>Untitled</em> feat MED, and another called <em>Travis 911</em>, appeared on Reddit/Soundcloud.\n\nSo how did this kid end up with unreleased Madvillian tunes? I had to chat with him to find out more.\n\n<strong>So, who are you?\n</strong>\nI'm a bored teenager from Glasgow of all places. I've been a fan of MF DOOM for the longest time. He inspired me to start rapping. I've been doing it since I was 9, but started taking it seriously as of late. Why? Well, my friends and people from my school said they liked my rapping.\n\n<strong>Let's get right into it – how'd you get the tracks?</strong>\n\nThey were floating about the MF DOOM sub-reddit [on Reddit] for the longest time. I had the tracks for a month, and gave it to fans I met online. It didn't click to upload the tracks until I saw a comment from someone on sub-reddit \"hiphopheads” asking about a “supposed” song DOOM actually recorded for the long-awaited new Madvillain album. I uploaded them, and it blew up from there. I originally gave credit to the actual leaker, but he messaged me and asked me not to.\n\n<strong>Has Stonesthrow contacted you?\n</strong>\nThey did! They asked me to take them down, and when I didn't they \"copyright claimed\" me, then said \"Thanks for nothing loser”. We had a few back and forth messages arguing. I don't think they liked it, but I did give them a lot of publicity.\n\n<strong>You’re a rapper yourself. Has anyone contacted you about your music as a result of all this?\n</strong>\nOver my rapping? Nah, but I haven't even put out a tape yet – so I expect it; That's why I'm doing two tapes. To double my chances of becoming the greatest Glasgow rapper.\n\n<strong>Tell me a bit about your music.</strong>\n\nI'm still working on my own style. My biggest influence is DOOM, like many others, and I've put a few songs on Soundcloud; however, I took down most of them since I rushed them. My first mixtape it is going to be called That's What I Call Fire ’15. It’ll be me rapping about mostly drugs (original I know) and some other stuff. For the second one is going to be a collaborative project with my friend, who's a producer. I'm still at the awkward stage of trying to find my style of rapping, but I'll definitely find it before I upload the tapes; if you like DOOM or Quasimoto (Stonesthrow kind of stuff) then you may like my upcoming tapes.\n\n<strong>What were you hoping to gain from this leak?\n</strong>\nNothing really – I just wanted to make people happy, and promote DOOM as much as I can. I want to be a part of Madvillain history; kind of funny, cause now my friends joke that I'm like the third Madvillain because of the leaks.\n\n<strong>Any last words?\n</strong>\nI promise that I’ll be working hard on these two tapes. I’m trying to make my first tape be both on par with my idols and something my friends (and admirers) can enjoy. Follow me on twitter: @TheInfamousSIR and Snapchat sherlock148.\n\n<hr />\n\n<strong>UPDATE:</strong> both tunes have been taken down. In an effort to stay in everyone's good book, we're going to refrain from posting them right now. But, a little digging does a body good!",

    "content_html": "Some 2-3 years after the release of Dr. Dre's (monumental) post-NWA solo debut album <i>The Chronic</i>, we were introduced to the true definition of \"chemistry\". Warren G (Dr.Dre's step-brother), along with long beach crooner Nate Dogg, bum-rushed the rap world with their breakthrough single, <i><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1plPyJdXKIY\">Regulate</a></i>. The gritty tale, flipped over Michael McDonald's I Keep Forgetting, became an instant classic and cemented the two in hip-hop history. Now 21 years later, Warren G effortlessly rekindles the charm of his classic debut album, and career-shadowing mega-hit with his new EP, <i><a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/regulate...-g-funk-era-pt./id1020512625\">Regulate... The G Funk Era Part II</a></i>.\n\nAt a short four songs long, the project clocks in at just 15 minutes. Nate Dogg appears on all of the songs – and it's wonderful. I initially thought the album would come off as more as a \"tribute\", but I was <i>way</i> wrong. With the exception of a reference to him being \"in heaven\" by Jeezy on the head nodding <i>Keep On Hustlin</i>, which also features Bun B, there are no RIPs here. There is also no forced attempt to sound as though this EP was recorded in 1995. It seems modern, clean and is dripping in g-funk. <i>Saturday</i>, featuring E-40 and Too $hort took me back to my high school days when Long Beach ran shit. The uptempo ear candy made me reminiscent of 90's BBQ's, just kicking in on the basketball court and everything I love about summer.\n\nDropping a part two of your debut on the 20th anniversary is becoming a played out attempt by some artists to capitalize on their legacy. This isn't that. It's also likely why Warren let that milestone pass. As 2/3 of 213, the original trio that included Snoop, Nate and Warren have a timeless \"je ne sais quoi\" that can only happen organically, and in some cases, once in a lifetime (if ever). They're examples of a perfect sonic combination – not unlike Scarface, Bushwick and Willie D. Most of all, they're legends who helped to pioneer the g-funk sound that seems to make a resurgence thanks to a new generation of artists like YG and Kendrick Lamar. <i>The G Funk Era Part II</i> is another extension of their legacy. It's a must-have for OG fans, and a fitting metaphorical \"pouring of liquor\" for one of the hottest hook-makers in the history of hip-hop.\n\nRIP Nate Dogg!\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w-Qm1ez_BMY",

    "content_html": "I <i>hate</i> writing tribute or \"memorial\" pieces – and, unfortunately, this is the second one I've written in the past 30 days. Like many, I learned yesterday that hip-hop lost yet another institution. Hip-hop heavyweight Sean Price, much to the shock of many in the (worldwide) community, passed away in his sleep. Most of the readers here don't need this, but I'm going to give a \"little\" background on P. He rose to prominence in the golden era of hip-hop as one-half of the group Heltah Skeltah. The duo were prominent pillars of the supergroup Boot Camp Click [which also counted many of my fave rappers ever as members]. P was also a member of Random Axe, but most notably – I think – he rebranded himself and focused on his solo career, releasing three full-length solo albums over the last decade. If you need more than that, you probably should just Google him because you missed out.\n\nSean had many enviable qualities. He was a rapper's rapper, by which I mean he had <i>serious</i> bars. He came up in the golden era, and as everyone knows, times have changed. That's an understatement. The game is not the same. It's a digital world, and hip-hop is very much a commercial endeavour. Duck Down as a <span style=\"text-decoration: line-through;\">label</span> family seem to have done a fantastic job staying not only true to the craft but also relevant to their core audience. Sean, as a solo artist, was especially great at it.\n\nIf you've ever watched any of his videos, you get it. He was a funny dude. He seemed like he didn't take himself too seriously. He was also notorious for being an asshole online. I'm not afraid to say he blocked us on Twitter [note: we're still not sure why]; however, when we pointed it out, we realized we weren't alone. He blocked at will. Posted at will – and off the cuff. He didn't care what you thought. Like, at all. He didn't portray an image of a wealthy rapper lifestyle. He was just an average guy – who happened to be a microphone bully. This common man appeal and rock-star ego made him a fan favourite. His down to earth qualities made him a revered member of the hip-hop community at large, and the inner circle of New York's underground (true school) scene. He was a huge personality, and this is a huge loss for hip-hop.\n\nUnderstand, I'm coming at this as a HUGE fan; although, reading some of the messages today from his peers, it's obvious that his big personality had made tremendous impacts on their lives.\n\nHe leaves behind a wife and three wonderful children. Our deepest condolences – and prayers – go out to them.\n\nRIP\n\n<hr />\n\n<iframe src=\"http://www.audiomack.com/embed4-large/aboveaveragehh/rip-sean-price\" width=\"100%\" height=\"280\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe>",

    "content_html": "<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Something Meek Mill said in his \"beef resignation letter\" really stuck out for some reason. Specifically, it was when he detailed how idiotic risking his money and career over some street shit would truly be. Oddly enough, when I read the statement, the following line popped into my head: \"... If I shoot you, I'm brainless; if you shoot me, you're famous – so what's a brother to do?\"</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">I'm a rap nerd, so instantly Ingot nostalgic and dug out my <em>Streets Is Watching</em> soundtrack. While listening, I started thinking about what an amazingly hype project [referring to the movie, not the soundtrack] this was, in hindsight. I mean long before his wife dropped a mystery album with a (high quality) video for every song, Jay-Z released probably – at the time – the most ambitious project ever. Let's hop in our time machine – beep.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The time is May 1998. Jay-Z was revelling in the mixed success of his second album, <em><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bdMm0VpcBc&list=PL-UWPlRIl68p2fUXDcjSxFiDRbY9QuICR\">In My Lifetime Vol.1</a></em>. I say mixed because even though it was <strong>extremely</strong> successful on the charts, many claimed the album was much more polished and commercial than his debut, which was considered a classic. Led by singles like <em><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-C_yCbai3E8\">Sunshine</a></em>, and <em><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b4J-wTP-GdU\">I Know What Girls Like</a></em>, many lovingly regarded him as a \"sell out.\" [editors note: if you take these two songs out of the equation, this album is easily in Jay's top 5]. In the midst of this, Jay released the Dame Dash produced film, <em>Streets is Watching</em>: a self-funded (300k+) film. It was a collection of unreleased videos and cinematic storylines that (roughly) told the story of how he came up and made a name for himself in the rap game. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">When discussing the film, Dame describes the intense label intervention they had up to that point. They were less than excited about the single <em><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwk74PoJbWg\">Sunshine</a> (</em>specifically, its video<em>)</em>, and seemed to share some of the same sentiments the streets did. The mantra behind this project is that he wanted to give visual treatment to the b-sides, and tracks that the labels <em>didn't</em> want to push. Understandably, the label didn't want to pay for it, so they paid for it themselves – out of pocket. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The cinematography, the wide angle lenses, the dialogue; it's an excellent blend of tail end golden-era bars and aesthetic, with pre jiggy-era opulence. If you haven't watched it, it's a must-see. Especially if you're an early Jay fan. It brings many of his, arguably, <strong>best</strong> songs (up to that point) to life. It was even the first place that some of us got to his first videos, <em><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DitP6zlxWTE\">In My Lifetime</a></em> and <em><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5crdyCtazg\">I Can't Get With That</a></em>.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">This project is often left out of conversations about Jigga, but it's worth recalling. It was incredibly ambitious, and ahead of its time. I liken it to the way that people seem never to give Naughty By Nature props for being the first rap group to drop a clothing line. <em>Streets is Watching</em>, and its soundtrack featured many upstarts. Even the sole soundtrack appearance of the short-lived group Murda Inc (consisting of Jigga, Ja Rule and DMX), were staples in my life back in 1998. The biggest reason it took a backseat commercially? Well, four short months later he released <em>In My Lifetime Vol. 2</em>, which still stands as his highest selling album, going quintuple platinum. <em>Streets is Watching</em> stood no chance against <em><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNOYSIA-e_E\">Hard Knock Life</a></em>.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">It's never too late. Hop in the time machine, and enjoy this #TBT gem.</span></p>\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNprlnHydAE",

    "content_html": "<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Before I get into this, I have two initial confessions. One, is that I know DJ Priority, so for the sake of \"journalistic integrity\", this is more of a <em>suggestive</em> piece than a biased review. Secondly, I'm a sucker for remix projects – so now you know, and knowing is half the battle [*cue the GI Joe theme song].</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Now, DJ Priority – if you're unfamiliar – is an accomplished producer/DJ you should be up on. He's a beast on the MPC, and this week, well-timed on #WuWednesday, he dropped his latest project: <em>Iron Cinema</em>. The project is two things at once; it's an elaborate Ghostface Killah remix project, and a super dope beat-tape.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">At 10 joints long, Priority delivers a sonic bed that compliments the songs so well that they literally sound like actual studio versions. Furthermore, even though scattered in selection, the project sounds extremely cohesive. If not told otherwise upfront, you'd swear Ghost himself dropped this project. Standouts are the super gully remixes of <em>Apollo Kids</em> and <em>Daytona 500</em>. As a bonus, the artwork is insane! If you're an up and coming artist, or even one of our more <em>established</em> readers, you should definitely hit-up Priority for your next project. You can sound <strong>this nice</strong>.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The album can be streamed below. If you want to download it, it's a pay what you want situation – so if you enjoyed it, be sure to support it accordingly. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"></p>\n<iframe style=\"border: 0; width: 100%; height: 472px;\" src=\"https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=3153216649/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/artwork=small/transparent=true/\" seamless><a href=\"http://djpriority.bandcamp.com/album/iron-cinema\">Iron Cinema by DJ Priority</a></iframe>",

    "content_html": "I have to admit, as I sat down to write this, I contemplated opening up with a straight out Jersey meme, but thought that may come off a little too cliché. Granted, it would have been fine if I had reviewed this album when it first came across my desk. I admit it, in a sea of releases over the past few months, I completely slept on <i>Everything 050</i>, by the Jersey natives, 050 Boyz – a trio consisting of Prince AK, Tru Trilla and Riq da Kid. I get a lot of promos in my inbox, and for some reason this one just didn't jump out at me. I dropped the ball. Having given this project a few listens, I can definitely co-sign these guys. Here's why:\n\n<b>They are co-signed by legends</b>\n\nThe group has deep roots and connections in Jersey; however, as a \"group\" of sorts, they first worked together as part of the (shelved) super-group Garden State Greats. The failed group was the brain child of Naughty by Nature frontman Treach. As the 050 Boyz, a group whose ideology is based on the original Garden State Greats concept, they've been guided by DoItAll, one 1/3 of the Lord of the Underground. Now, not sure about you, but Naughty and Lords are definitely in my top 25 groups ever – in fact, The Lord's Keepers of the Funk was one of my fave albums growing up. I know co-signs aren't everything, but having someone who helped shape your love of the culture put their stamp on something should make it an auto-cop.\n\n<b>They are consistent with their production</b>\n\nI've said it a million times, I'm a sucker for single producer album. This project was produced entirely by Clinton Place who have it's boom-bap charm. This direction keeps the project sounding cohesive, rather than a series of loosies.\n\n<b>They don't take chances – in a good way</b>\n\nThis album fails to really break any creative ground, but that's not a bad thing. Rather than try to fit themselves into any contrived roles, they just drop bars with a golden era aesthetic – and obvious street logic and sensibility.\n\nSonically, the group have great chemistry. They almost put me in mind of State Property (only slightly). From the album opener <i>Hot Damn</i>, the posse cut <i>Concrete Combat </i>– which features the hottest Onyx sample ever – to the introspective <i>What Happened</i>, they sound like vets; although, they still have a spark in their overall demeaneor. Standouts for me were also the Treach assisted <i>DNA</i>, and DoItAll assisted <i>Pay Them No Mind</i>. The album is definitely worth a spin. I'll definitely keep my eye on these guys.\n\n<i>What's next?</i>\n\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"450\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/217736690&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true\"></iframe>",

    "content_html": "<blockquote>“I’m trying to be legendary, life is short like the month of February…\"\n– Tooty\n</blockquote>\nWhat were you doing on the 10th anniversary of Kanye's <em>College Dropout</em>? I was busy <a href=\"http://aboveaveragehiphop.com/the-college-dropout-11-years-later/\">writing about</a> it – naturally. Spencer Waddell though, better known by his \"stage name\" Tooty, was busy uploading his debut mixtape, <em>First Degree Murder</em>. Unfortunately, with a name like that, and the current temperament of the \"Chiraq\" eco-sphere, I wasn't quite sure whether or not I was walking into a project that treaded more into the Chief Keef side of things. Lucky for me, Tooty's project follows in the footsteps of some of the more pivotal Chi-Town hip-hop \"institutions\".\n\n<em>First Degree Murder</em> is an exciting blend of sounds, emotions and Midwest charm. It paints a portrait of a dream chaser, lady killer [figuratively] and a street smart young man who's managed to overcome the negativity engulfing the city of Chicago. The first track I was drawn to was <em>Life Ain't What It Seem</em>, featuring <a href=\"http://aboveaveragehiphop.com/xvrhldy-new-sound-chi-town/\">XVRHLDY</a>. If you're an AAHIPHOP reader, you know we're <strong>big</strong> fans of his – and this song definitely didn't disappoint. I then rounded back to the top and ran through the 15 joint project head to toe. \n\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"450\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/playlists/64811089&color=ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false\"></iframe>\n\n<blockquote>\"Consider this a page in my diary, I’m currently at work – and I’m hoping my boss fire me”\n–Tooty</blockquote>\n\nThe project, overall, is quite honest and dripping with real life experience – no over the top embellishing here. On songs like <em>I Don't Need A Hook</em>, and the super dope <em>Dear Diary</em>, he discusses topics such as loss, drive and determination, while he gets silky on bassy joints like <em>On Repeat</em> and the LL Cool J sampled <em>Super Fly</em>. The latter reminded me of the song <em><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWgU5vpUOTI\">Sparkle</a></em> by Camp-Lo. Standouts for me were the super laid-back <em>To Whom It May Concern</em>, the obligatory ode to the culture, <em>Hip-Hop</em>, and the super creative TLC flip, <em>Creep</em>.\n\nFirst impressions aren't always fair – as a writer, I'm reminded of that everyday. The (now seemingly clever) title and cover of this project had me judging Tooty before I pressed play. Now, 15 joints later, I've placed him on my mind's shelf next to other bright stars hailing from the Windy City. Even the title track itself, <em>First Degree Murder</em> was super laid back, and surprisingly bar heavy; a far cry from the braggadocios/salacious gun talk I was expecting.  \n\nTooty is currently putting the finishing touches on his follow-up, <em>Suicidal Thoughts</em>. Now, this is the third time this week I've professed my love of single producer albums, but – shit – I <em>love</em> them. Tooty is going that route, working entirely with producer Von Vuai, and guests including XVRHLDY. We'll definitely be checking for it!\n\nBelow is the first single from the project.\n\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/218276707&color=ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false\"></iframe>",

    "content_html": "Have you taken a look at the Billboard charts this week? If not, don't feel bad, most people usually don't! Well, if you did, you may have noticed some anomalies – namely the extremely high number of copies of Eazy-E, Ice Cube and Dr.Dre albums that have been moving off of (virtual) shelves since the release of the record-breaking biopic <i>Straight Outta Compton</i>. Interesting, no one is rushing out to cop any Mc Ren solo joints, but I'll leave that alone. How cool is that, though?\n\nAside from the obvious NWA sales, it's interesting to see a mix of old and new heads discovering – and rediscovering – albums like the polarizing <i><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL3439985BB6B155CC\">Niggaz4Life</a>, </i>Ice Cube's <i><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d5aAviQAzSY&list=PLED9F2553D669F423\">Amerikka's Most Wanted</a></i>, and Eazy's <i><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLdcApvm04PHeyEiL86H6x-_-oe56p3xQ4\">EZ Duz It</a></i>, which was actually charting this week (serious – number 42!). This movie is shining a spotlight on the expanding catalogue of the Compton institution (and its offshoots). I'm down. Not so much with everyone suddenly draping themselves in Raiders gear but encouraging heads to start delving into hip-hop history is golden.\n\n<iframe src=\"http://www.audiomack.com/embed4-large/aboveaveragehh/straight-outta-serato-squeaky-clean-nwa-mini-mixtape-sfw-compton\" width=\"100%\" height=\"250\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe>\n\nIt makes me hungry for the Tupac biopic by John Singleton, or perhaps a Wu-Tang flick. How about a Gangstarr movie? If it takes a slew of well-made Hollywood movies to keep classic back-catalogues alive for another generation, then so be it! What ever happened to the <a href=\"https://youtu.be/VbcSMJgeSSY\">Juice Crew movie</a>, though?",

    "content_html": "<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Hip-hop truly is world-wide. I’ll preface this by admitting that my knowledge of the hip-hop scene down-under is less than expansive, so if I sound off base at all, that’s why. I recently came across an Aussie (Perth to be exact) artist that I’m really digging. He goes by the name of L.S.D, and (to me anyways) he’s an Australian answer to <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MHNJMom8QRM\">Rob Kelly</a> [who by the way is a must listen]. Four years after his last release, a <em><a href=\"https://www.google.ca/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0CB4QFjAAahUKEwiIuJygvcTHAhWHe5IKHReuBoI&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.reverbnation.com%2Flsdmusic&ei=QYDcVciTHYf3yQSX3JqQCA&usg=AFQjCNFZaJV5JTLoeCyY06n6rdxkVR-v5g&sig2=U0XHOLhbi3QGvtaCkbHRDA\">Lighter Shade of Darkness</a></em>, and a brief retirement/hiatus, he’s returning to the scene with an album entitled <em><a href=\"https://lsdhiphop.bandcamp.com/album/off-the-grid\">Off The Grid</a></em> – and he reached out to AAHIPHOP to spread some of his vibes. I saw the obvious fit, because we’re big fans of Blackalicious over here (peep our <a href=\"http://aboveaveragehiphop.com/interview-with-gift-of-gab/\">Gift of Gab</a> interview), and he very much fits into that pocket. In fact, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lJd5H_PuTRA&feature=youtu.be\">he worked with him</a> on his first album.</span></p>\nHis album is a wonderful mix of old school charm, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsIbAEN0mKgamR07aYJDHtg/videos\">High and Mighty</a>-esque sonic beds and turntablism (orchestrated by Rob Shaker). To top it off, L.S.D has bars –like REALLY dope bars. It’s a great listen. After the first track, I didn’t even notice he had an accent at all, and the fact that he’s from Australia isn’t used as any sort of gimmick or on-running pun. From the jump, with the high-energy title track, <em>Off The Grid</em>, L.S.D sets the tone, and carries the pace throughout with few missteps. He tackles a range of topics from the staple “overcoming in the face of adversity” on the uptempo (very fun) <em>GO</em>, to soaking in the experience and perspective from a conversation with a 75 year-old on the song <em>Story To Tell</em>. Standouts for me were the joints <em>Alive Again</em>, where he discusses universal true-school hip-hop relevancy struggles, the infidelity shaming <em>Cheaters</em> and the uptempo (sexy) sax laced <em>Rio</em>.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wejbDGKfjw8\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The album's overall strength lies in its intricacy. The micro details (like the cuts) and the general quality – sonically <em>and</em> creatively – are top-notch. It's a very solid effort, and with exception of a few references I just didn't understand, it was quite universal, while remaining true to what I perceive the Perth scene to be. It's full of real-world stories, hardship and most of all, <em>substance</em>. The fact that I'm limited by North American references to give this man context is a testament to my narrow-minded my view of the culture.

It’s also home to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/rpthachozen1\">RP Tha Chozen 1</a>, of the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/rebelgeniuscrew\">Rebel Genius Crew</a>: a surprisingly lyrical new voice on the scene. His vocal cadence and flow almost put me in mind of Kendrick – with it’s trademark west coast swag – but still maintains its own personality and melodic vibe. Definitely one to keep an eye on!\n\nOn his latest joint \"The Greatest Tragedy\" RP spits a vivid rendition of the classic \"forbidden love\" tale of Romeo and Juliet over a viby beat, Produced by Carnegie – with guest vocals on the hook by Shaad G of Sound Collage Muzik.\n\nHe has a new album dropping September 15th called The Harvest. If it's anything like this joint, it should be on your list!

    "content_html": "<blockquote>I spit gems through the mouth of gods – I'm so real...\n—Blank Face</blockquote>\nI consider myself to be tastemaker of sorts, and often find myself sifting through endless seas of \"next-up\" rappers looking for unique voices we can champion here at AAHIPHOP. The other day, while creeping accounts [we all do it] that liked one of my recent photos on Instagram, I came across a super dope illustration of the rap's elite with their heads on stakes... I clicked through and discovered a young Brooklyn cat by the name of Blank Face.\n\nThe artwork in question was the cover for a track called <i>Jungle</i>, a 7 minute assault on the the upper echalon of \"power rappers\" who currently run the North American scene. Now, this concept is fully unique, but his bars and voice were. I began diggin through his Soundcloud to see if the joint was a fluke – but it wasn't! He has this grimey New York vibe that I grew up idolizing, with an obvious hunger thatbyiu only get with younger cats. He has serious skills, and I wanted to introduce him to all of you! Peep the Q&A below.\n\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/214879731&color=ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false\"></iframe>\n\n<b>How did you get into hip-hop?</b>\n\nThe first song I ever heard was Tupac's <i>How Do You Want It</i>. After I heard that song, I was hooked. I started to rewrite his lyrics on old school notebooks. Soon, I started to replace words with my own... And next thing you know, I had sheets and sheets of rhymes and ideas. I started digging into the crates to learn the origins, and become a great listener of everything that had to do with Hip-Hop.\n\n<b>Who are some of your influences?</b>\n\nSome major influences of mine are Tupac, Biggie, Pusha T, Eminem, J.Cole, Kendrick, Wu-Tang – and can't forget 50 Cent! He's One of my favourites.\n\n<b>Tell me about <i>Jungle</i>.</b>\n\n<i>Jungle</i> was originally suppose to be a 3 minute song. I wrote it frustrated at the current state of hip hop. I hate that it's not about lyrics anymore – it's about a hot beat and hook... There isn't any substance. I was basically letting all my favourite rappers know that I respect them enough to compete against them in any form, to prove I'm a worthy opponent [sic]. The hook was <i>supposed</i> to be me piecing together a bunch of interviews from all the rappers I mentioned throughout the song, but it was still missing something and it sounded to forced and clustered. My Producer, manager and I sat on the record for about a week and a half – and then they came over to my crib to see what we could brainstorm. A third verse became the option but not just any verse... It had to be powerful, and we didn't wanna just extend the beat. We were playing some instrumentals and then it just happened. Mobb Deep's <i>Shook One's</i> came on, and we began to chop it up. I wrote <i>way</i> more then I was suppose to, so we extended the beat twice – and I still had too many bars! We went to the studio a few days later, recorded it, and it came out crazy. We had that song for maybe 4 months and then we finally decided to drop it. 7 minutes of Damage.\n\n<b>Who did that crazy cover?</b>\n\nI do all my own artwork. I have a Degree in Graphic Design – and I'm a Fine Artist as well (with pencil and paper).\n\n<b>What are you currently working on?</b>\n\nI'm currently working on a project called <i>H3ZUS LINX</i>. It's basically me using a Jesus chain as a metaphor for being detached from God... It should be a really dope project, not sure on how many tracks but it's def on the way. I should be dropping the first track in about a week or two, once I finish the artwork for it. I'm also working on a 90s RNB Project using samples of old RNB songs that were poppin in the 90s.\n\n<b>Do you perform live?</b>\n\nYeah, I perform live at open mic's. I usually post it on Instagram prior to the performance of where people can go to see me.\n\n<b>Where can people find you?</b>\n\nYou can find me on Instagram @IAmBlankFace and you can check me out On SoundCloud - BlankFaceNYC.",

    "content_html": "[dropcap]W[/dropcap]hen talking about group dynamics, people like to point towards Wu-Tang Clan as the quintessential example of a hip-hop dynasty; however, that's not entirely accurate. It's impossible to have such a conversation and negate the influence of the Boot Camp Click. They were a super-group composed of inner groups: Black Moon, OGC, Smiff-N-Wessun, and one of my fave groups, Heltah Skeltah.\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Heltah Skeltah, a duo composed of Rock and Ruck (Sean Price), came into notoriety when they dropped their classic debut <em><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL-Ga097xThpxGPKozaNlazBeprTw_SUU0\">Nocturnal</a>.</em> It contained a few of my fav tracks of the era, namely \"Therapy\" and \"Operation Lockdown.\" As a group, they released three albums total – the aforementioned, <em><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4ACD7047943364A2\">Magnum Force</a></em> and <em><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL8Dr-s2vb69r0NyxhSYz3gRdiXpxkNdGy\">D.I.R.T</a></em> ( Da Incredible Rap Team) – amidst a sea of collaborations, turmoil, and a brief split.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">A few weeks ago, the hip-hop world was rocked by the unexpected death of Sean Price. Word spread quickly, and outpouring of grief, and dazed memorial set timelines on fire. His influence, and genuine respect among his peers – and fans alike – was apparent.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">I decided to reach out to Sean's longtime partner in Rhyme to discuss his music, Heltah Skeltah, and the legacy Sean P leaves behind. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Peep the interview below.</span></p>\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-59SGc_h80\n\n<strong>How did you get hip-hop?</strong>\n\nWell, Beatboxing, and Roxanne Roxanne. Honestly, in its earlier days, when it was still a relatively small community, I was younger and wasn't that into it; but, when I heard Roxanne Roxanne, that's when I started writing. I wrote my first rap during that period.\n\n<strong>How did you get into the game?</strong>\n\nWell, I got lucky. I had friends that did a lot of the hard work – I just got to have fun. I just had to rap. Steele from Smiff N' Wessun, he was the hardest worker. He used to hang out and do all types of fuckery with us on the street, and also went to school and worked a job to pay for studio time. So really, I got lucky... I came in the game on the strength of my mans and them.\n\n[In hindsight, I wish I'd prodded a little more about his relationship with Tek and Steele. They were instrumental figures in the careers of not just Sean Price and Rock, but also the members of OGC. They all got their first taste of the industry on the back of their classic album \"Dah Shinin”]\n\n<strong>How had you initially met Sean Price?</strong>\n\nI don't know; our mothers knew each other. My earliest memory of him was at his 11th birthday party. It was his surprise birthday party, and he already had a job at that point.\n\n<strong>At what stage did you decide to come together as a duo – at what stage did you decide to become Heltah Skeltah?</strong>\n\nWe agreed to that over the phone when I got locked up in 1992. But, I had already known for a while that was what I wanted to do. Once I heard son get busy, and I saw his abilities and all that [sic], I knew I wanted him to be my partner. It was just a matter of playing my cards right, feeling out the situation and making it happen.\n\n<strong>What was the process of recording Nocturnal?</strong>\n\nThere were a lot of late nights. A lot of dudes, a lot of cigars, a lot of vegetables, and a lot of jokes. There were some women around – but not too many. There were also a lot of snacks around. Mad cookies and cakes, and a lot of greenery.\n\n<strong>You guys appeared to break up after your second album, <em>Magnum Force</em>. What was the reason? Was there any animosity?</strong>\n\nNah, We didn’t break up. I just left Duck Down. We were just on two different pages at that particular point in time. Son was trying to do one thing, and I was attempting to do another; although, Heltah Skeltah was still intact. I was on his [Sean Price] first solo album. For all the time that I wasn’t with Duck Down and cats was saying that we had supposedly broken up… Yeah, I split with Duck Down, but I didn’t split with the Boot Camp. Duck Down just happens to be Dru Ha and Buckshot’s company, so it’s tricky. But it wasn’t that serious on a Heltah Skeltah level.\n\n<strong>What made you guys get back together to do the <em>D.I.R.T</em> album?</strong>\n\nWe felt like it was time. It wasn't that complicated. Everything was rapid-fire, and back to back. Ruck [Sean Price] dropped Monkey Bars; Smiff N Wessun dropped Reloaded, and Buckshot and 9th Wonder dropped Chemistry. Then we were out touring the Last Stand [a 2007 group album by Boot Camp Click]. It was in full swing. So while people were like \"oh shit, Rock is back?\" We were already albums deep. We had bullets in the chamber. We also recorded Casualties of War [another Boot Camp album released the same year] during that period. So at that point, all of the disagreements I'd had with Duck Down had been hashed out, and we were all in. By the time we did D.I.R.T, it was just a matter of asking \"are you guys ready?\"\n\n<strong>What are you working on now?</strong>\n\nI'm working on a bunch of shit. My solo album, for one. I've been working on it for a while now, but you know... Situations change, the sounds change, my ears change, and the message I may be trying to give the people may change. The album is in the process. Life happens though, and right now. I just lost the Yin to my Yang ... My brother just died. So, there are changes that need to happen on my album now.\n\n<strong>What are some of your fondest memories of Sean Price?</strong>\n\nJust knowing him, just having the privilege to be chosen to be that nigga's partner [sic] – that's bigger than anything else. He was a one of a kind, unique soul. You don't just find an energy like his anywhere. As unique as we all are as human beings, I mean, you may find somebody else at some point that reminds you of me, but you won't find anyone that reminds you of him. He was one of one – and he chose me. I mean, I tricked him into accepting me, but he chose me!\n\n<strong>What would you want the world to know about Sean Price?</strong>\n\nEverything I just said. When I say he was special, I mean that. I want them to listen to his catalog – and his jokes, his vulgarities and all his slap the shit out you isms, and enjoy all of it. He epitomized the term not giving a fuck – and being yourself in the truest form. Always telling the truth is a part of being yourself, but with him, it was a bit more complicated. If he felt like lying to you, he would. He didn't give a fuck about your rules. He would say what I was thinking. Shit that you were scared to say, he'd say – no problem.\n\nOn top of all that, he was a great father and a wonderful husband. He was proud to be married. He wasn't one of these cats out here who's married acting like they aren't married – running around in videos and misleading the public. I mean, I get the look, but I also understand the subliminal messages we send to people through our music – and videos. We're all programmed by what we see. I mean, there's a nigga named Rambo in every hood [sic] ... Where did we get that from? That's the kind of stuff that came from our programming, things that were always pushed into our faces. Our whole lives. A vast majority of the punchlines that most rappers have were influenced by movies and TV.\n\n<strong>We're shaped by what we see.</strong>\n\nThe right wingers always want to come down on rappers for the messages we share, and the impact we have on the youth. I said it on wax: \"We influence the kids – but who influences the rappers?\" Biggie Smalls called himself Frank White. Where'd he get that from? They don't want to talk about that.\n\nWhen Biggie Small died, how old was he?\n\n<strong>26, I believe. I remember being young and thinking he was a grown man... But in hindsight, he was young!</strong>\n\nThat's exactly where I was going with this... I mean when you look back on it what, 15 years later, and you realize he was just 25–26... He was a fucking kid! All the hardest rappers out there were just kids. We were all young minds, still susceptible to peer pressure, and influence. If you're in the NBA, those dudes protect your ass. Even if you're in your 30's, you still a system around designed to keep you straight. But not for us. We had to learn on our own. I have been around the world, and I learned: fuck all this imagery. That dude Sean Price took his wife everywhere – if he could take her, he took her. He rapped about her on half of his songs, and he's got like 1000 songs. That type of thing speaks volumes. Very few of us out here are being our authentic selves.\n\n<strong>And as well, the outpour of love and support he received worldwide speaks volumes to the impact he had on people's lives.</strong>\n\nWord. He was a magnetic dude. A fucking comedian. He's legitimately one of the funniest people you'd ever meet – and he'd smack the shit out you. I just love that combination.\n\n<strong>That's an excellent combination.</strong>\n\nThat's what I want the world to know about him... But really, the world probably already knows that. All they got to do is listen to one of his records. You'll probably hear him mention his wife; you'll probably hear him shout out his daughter; actually, you for sure will. He always mentions himself, and he named his daughter Shaun Price – so he legitimately says her name in every song. So her name will be immortalized. He did that for her, or maybe for him, but that's that, he mentions her name in every song. You'll hear everything I just said.\n\nSo in a sense, I could've just said, \"play one of his records.\" Because it's all him – through and through. Even when he's saying some weird shit that you know couldn't have happened in real life, it's still him.\n\n<hr />\n\nhttps://youtu.be/SSCrBuSJx5w",

    "content_html": "<blockquote>\"Backhandler, manhandle, Imam Sean; peace to Mandela and Farrakhan... The best con in flesh, Sean's here, metal fragments on face, the teflon beard…”\n– Sean Price</blockquote>\n<em><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAkrCietTS0\">Songs in the key of life</a></em> was a milestone in the legendary career of the inspiring Mr. Stevie Wonder. Heralded by many – to this day – as his best album, it was a culmination/climax of his pre-commercial musical career, referred to mainly as his \"classic period.\" With this in mind, Sean Price’s ode (cover wise) to the classic album, <em><a href=\"https://www.google.ca/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0CCAQFjAAahUKEwj54a2Oz9bHAhWLWpIKHaKGA54&url=https%3A%2F%2Fitunes.apple.com%2Fus%2Falbum%2Fsongs-in-the-key-of-price%2Fid1023504250&usg=AFQjCNH4c_FdmTgE7K_8h0TTNamJOwhGQw&sig2=bFC4YiBWK_0mEeurghKMDg&bvm=bv.101800829,d.dmo\">Songs in the Key of Sean Price</a></em>, seems eerily appropriate.\n\nAnnounced shortly before his death, the un-intended posthumous release has two versions available to fans: an 8 track digital version available on I-tunes, and a 30 track mixtape/version, cut up by longtime friend, collaborator and DJ, DJ PF Cuttin. [Note that the sales from both versions go to Sean’s wife and kids]. We had a pre-order in, and after anxiously checking the mailbox daily since it shipped on the 21st, it finally arrived yesterday and has been bumping hard ever since.\n\n<hr />\n\n<em>\"Listen to his catalogue – and his jokes, his vulgarities and all his slap the shit out you isms, and enjoy all of it. He epitomized the term not giving a fuck – and being yourself in the truest form.”</em>\n\n– <a href=\"http://aboveaveragehiphop.com/a-conversation-with-rock-of-heltah-skeltah/\">Rock (of Heltah Skeltah)</a>\n\n<iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/218772840&color=ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false\" width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" frameborder=\"no\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe>\n\n<hr />\n\nThe release is incredibly solid – and sure to satisfy old and new fans alike. It has all the characteristics of a P project: it’s vicious, no holds barred, gutter, humorous and full of quotable lines. No filler either! Just heat, from the opener, the booming Bobby MC Bars and the 70’s drug-dealer flows on Fei Long, to the ‘in your face’ Planet Apes, and the release closer, Ni**erific – a the flip of the Cool Rob G classic Court In Session. Featured verses come from the likes of Ike Eyes, Ill Ghee, Head Ice, Vic Spencer and Royal flush.\n\nRegardless if Sean has a ton of material stacked up and ready to go, this project will always serve as the last release that he knowingly released – and in my opinion, he went out strong. The project was worth the wait, and more than delivered on expectations. The love, as usual, is in the details. The beats are hard; the bars require multi-listens. Even the album itself are listed (on iTunes and Spotify) as being released on “Ruck Down Records” – a nice “Easter egg” for real heads. Rock said it best during our interview last week, through and through his music is all him. Sean Price was a unique soul, and I’m will be a blueprint for a whole new generation of artists who seem to be shedding the conventions of the commercial shackles and wandering down the “indie-brick-road”. This album is a MUST OWN for any and all P fans – and I implore you: if you haven’t fully taken in his catalog, please do so.\n\nI’ll end this piece the same he ended this project: “P!”\n\n<hr />\n\nBuy the album <a href=\"http://www.duckdown.com/seanprice\">here</a>.",

Without major label backing, it's ultimately up to the artists themselves how far they want to take their careers before they inevitably hang up the mic. This is where the clear delineation between rappers and real artists becomes apparent, though. While a \"rapper\" may shy away slowly when faced with lack of significant notoriety, or an uphill journey that just seems, well, hard – a true artist continues because he has no choice. Mr. P Chill is one such artist. Hailing from Sacramento, he's been doing the damn thing for over two decades. 23 years to be exact (he's 41 now). He's a working artist in a real sense of the term. He has a busy tour schedule, and literally (but more so <em>figuratively</em>) eats off of his music. How many of you can say that? Honestly?</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">His latest effort, <em>Still Standing</em> is 12 joints long. It showcases his honesty, determination, love of the culture, spirituality and, above all, his gratitude towards his fans and followers. The one's that attend his shows across the nation – Currently, he tours the country [USA]. There are some definite gems on this disc. The title track lays out his 23-year journey in the game and solidifies his dedication to the culture of hip-hop. The soulful <em>You Got Me</em> is an audio 'pound' to all his supporters who keep him going. Other stand-outs here are the retrospective <em>Time Machine</em> and the introspective <em>Spiritual Journey</em>. As well, the <i>Afro Puffs</i> flip on <em>You Got the Best of Me</em> is a must-listen. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">He also has some surprising features here, like the rhyme inspector <a href=\"https://www.stonesthrow.com/perceep\">Percee P</a> on the song <em>Veteran Status</em>, and Spyder D on the head nodding <em>No Regrets</em>. Now for those who don’t know <a href=\"http://raprehab.com/some-hip-hop-history-with-spyder-d/\">Spyder D</a>, he was the first rapper in history to release an independent record – making him (in a sense) the living/breathing mecca of indie rap. Cool right?</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Mr. P Chill genuinely enjoys what he does, and he’s dedicated his life to it. This love comes across in his work. <em>Still Standing</em> is at once an excellent introduction to his catalogue and a salute to all those who have kept him metaphorically running over the past 23 years. Give it a spin!</span></p>\n\n\n<hr />\n\n<iframe src=\"https://embed.spotify.com/?uri=spotify%3Aalbum%3A0Uo38BLLt4Ny4plZyyQGsK\" width=\"100%\" height=\"380\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe>",

I'd like to introduce you all to a new voice hailing the city – Descendent. <a href=\"http://aboveaveragehiphop.com/unsigned-hype-descendent/\">I featured this brother</a> a while back in the #UnsignedHype section but wanted to delve a little deeper into his work. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">His debut album, <em>Road to Greatness: Journey of a Lost Soul</em>, is an excellent body of work. It's an an eclectic mix of bassy trap sounds on songs like <em>Road To the Future</em> and <em>Break The Cycle</em>, 90's boom bap on songs like <em>Too Easy</em> and <em>Trouble</em>, and soulful hip-hop beats on songs like <em>I'm Ready</em> and <em>Soul</em> – which almost brings to mind the early work of hometown hero 9th Wonder. The mixture of sounds is very organic, which makes it hard to pinpoint if he's \"stronger\" when concentrating on one particular sound. Nothing sounds forced – and although he switches up the sonic-sub genre, he never wavers from his message or personal style/flow. He’s honest, insightful, and very real. He focuses on positive messages, stories of struggle, determination and moral-filled lyrics that paint a very clear picture of who he is as a person – and an artist. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">His dedication to his craft – and values – is best summed in the two skits on the project. In the second last one, which is a preamble to the album closer <em>Soul</em>, he’s told he should “live the life” and make a more commercially viable brand of hip-hop. He responds only with, “ I don’t want to be another lost soul.” This sentiment is expressed throughout <em>Road to Greatness: Journey of a Lost Soul</em>. For a debut project, it's exceptionally polished and self-aware. Descendent is one to keep an eye on. </span></p>\n\n\n<hr />\n\n<iframe style=\"border: 0; width: 100%; height: 472px;\" src=\"https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=2213816063/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/artwork=small/transparent=true/\" width=\"300\" height=\"150\" seamless=\"\">&lt;a href=\"http://descendent.bandcamp.com/album/road-to-greatness-journey-of-a-lost-soul\"&gt;Road to Greatness: Journey of a Lost Soul by Descendent&lt;/a&gt;</iframe>",

    "content_html": "<blockquote>\n<p class=\"p1\">To me, he was my father, he was Eric – daddy Eric. To everybody else, he was Eazy-E.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">– Yung Eazy</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The movie <em>Straight Outta Compton</em> took the world by storm and introduced a <a href=\"http://aboveaveragehiphop.com/nwa-for-a-new-generation/\">whole new generation of kids</a> to the world’s most dangerous group, NWA. For all of the minute details the film captured, it did seem to skim over the most obvious details of Eazy-E’s personal life, and the post-NWA success of Ruthless Records. For starters, the label had many other artists, most notably the platinum-selling <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J3nPLoODtGU\">JJ Fad</a>,<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RTA1Xg4Ejww\"> Michel’le</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMYAEHE2GrM\">Bone Thugs-N-Harmony</a>. As well, Eazy was a proud father. In fact, his eldest son Lil’ Eazy was born in 1984 – how did that never come up in the film?</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">We recently had a chance to chat with Eazy’s 3rd son Marquise Wright, aka Yung Eazy. Many of you readers may have learned about him recently. He made inter-web noise with a controversial Instagram post suggesting that <a href=\"https://www.google.ca/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=video&cd=5&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0CCgQtwIwBGoVChMIsKrwx6ftxwIVRkGSCh2X9gH7&url=http%3A%2F%2Fhiphopdx.com%2Fnews%2Fid.35228%2Ftitle.eazy-e-was-killed-his-son-yung-eazy-says&usg=AFQjCNHpwtJ_jyCQBkYsoCrHu7Ew1fD_1g&sig2=psWKvklRAPPI7ynkzuLOWw&bvm=bv.102022582,d.aWw\">Suge Knight was behind the death of his father</a> [a sentiment <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D_8eSWKE8o\">shared by many close to him</a>]. He’s been making music for a long time and is currently prepping the release of his first official EP release in advance of his inevitable album. We discussed our thought about the record-breaking biopic, his father’s legacy, and his career.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Check out our discussion below.</span></p>\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Z6aRBsGhig\n\n<hr />\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong><span class=\"s1\">So I’m assuming you saw the movie Straight Outta Compton...</span></strong></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Yeah yeah, I’ve seen it a few times.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong><span class=\"s1\">What did you think of it? What was your first impression of the movie?</span></strong></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">I mean… Before I start with the film, let me say… I saw the work they into this film. I had the chance actually to meet few of the actors. I kind of (personally) knew Jason Mitchell a little bit beforehand–  and then I had the opportunity to meet Neil. We had our audition for the movie the same day, which he was auditioning for Yella. When it first came out I was surprised how hard it hit, and how big of a box-office seller it was. I don’t know what to expect, but I knew it was going to be dope. It blew my mind when I did get to sit down and watch the movie. I got to see it a little bit before it came out in theaters, at a private screening/red carpet event.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong><span class=\"s1\">Do you think, maybe compared to the some of the other characters, that they didn’t delve deep enough into your father?</span></strong></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">I mean, I’m going to think that way. My dad had a long storyline,  throughout NWA – and aside from it when they split. The movie was supposed to be focusing on NWA as a group. I felt, like they did focus a little bit more on Dr. Dre and what he was doing in his side ventures and Ice Cube’s side ventures and so forth. They could’ve added a little bit more in regards to my dad and to what he was doing aside from the group split because he was still very much successful. You know, aside from NWA, Ruthless Records still had a bunch of gold (and platinum) selling artists like Michel’le, Kokane, Bone Thugs-N-Harmony and so forth. So I felt like they could have added a little bit more to the storyline than what they did. Once they split, they made it seem like everything went downhill for him, and then he started to get sick and so forth so. It could have played a little differently but like I said it was a good film. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong><span class=\"s1\">If you take a look at the billboard charts right, like this week, NWA’s Straight Outta Compton was at number four –  and Eazy Duz It was at number forty-two. There is a whole new legion of people that are just learning about NWA. So I just think it was kind of interesting that they chose to leave so much of his legacy out. </span></strong><strong><span class=\"s1\">You know, there’s this one scene where he's driving, and he was looking up at a billboard of <em>the Chronic</em>, and it’s this weird emotional scene. It almost negates the fact that he’d actually moved on and had a successful solo career.  </span></strong></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Yeah, if I can elaborate on that a little bit, I found that scene a little bit funny. Like you said – If you were born after the mid 90’s, you don’t know what was going on. I was talking to a kid the other day about my father’s death, and he was like, \"Eazy slept with all of these women…\" And I was like, wait how old are you? Thirteen? Like, you were born after 2000, you know what I’m saying? I know for a fact that they portrayed him with a different attitude and different demeanor. I don't know for a fact that he wanted to get the group gets back together but, you know, as far as that sentimental tearing up stuff... You've got to think, you’re talking about Eric Lynn Wright, Eazy-E, a gangster from the street. You think that he is going to be teared up at the fact that someone had left the group? You've got to think about it, when he was looking at Dr. Dre’s <em>Chronic</em> album, he was still making money off of everything Dr. Dre was putting out at that time. So, why would he be sad that he is making money from Dr. Dre? If anything he should be driving with a smile on his face!</span></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p class=\"p1\">People think of me as Eazy-E’s son, they typically think I’m going to try to bring that gangster music or that whole west coast thing; but in reality, I keep it more versatile.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">–Yung Eazy</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong><span class=\"s1\">They made like everyone was winning, but your dad was just starving to get back to the way it was.</span></strong></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Yeah, you know, they make it seem like he wasn’t anything without the group, and we all know that there's no truth to that. It was beneficial for all of them, and the world wanted to see NWA reunited again. Who would’ve not wanted to see that happen? The world’s most dangerous group!</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong><span class=\"s1\">I mean, again, it is Hollywood right, so you know what I'm saying? They should have shown more, though... Like with Bone Thugs. I mean one of the highest selling rap groups of all time right? The only mention was when Yella leaves a tape for your father when he's in the hospital.</span></strong></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Yeah, that’s the only evidence that you see of the Bone Thugs, I’m glad you realized that! I thought I was the only one who had seen that…  But when Dre left the group, they made sure that they showed Snoop Dogg and Tupac and so on and so forth… And anybody who is related to the ruthless side of the family, they only mentioned them. They mention Bone Thugs-n-Harmony; however, they didn’t have anybody actually in the film to portray those characters as if they were unimportant you know what I’m saying? But in reality, Bone Thugs is one of the biggest rap groups of all time – and are still doing their thing. They showed even showed the Lynch Mob.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong><span class=\"s1\">They didn’t make a big deal about Lynch Mob being there. It was tiny but it was there, there was some presence, you know? J.J Fad was another huge Ruthless group left out of the film.</span></strong></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Yeah, It was almost like some people were completely erased out of history. They were big back in the 80’s. You got to think about that; you can’t wipe them out from someone’s timeline, just because you felt like they aren't important.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong><span class=\"s1\">So let’s jump cues a little bit, let’s talk about your music and on what you’re doing… what you are working on right now.</span></strong></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Yeah man, well right now I’m working on my EP. This is one of my first actual official projects. I dropped a whole bunch of mixtapes just to get my name out there onto the streets, but it’s that time to have that appetizer before the main course. I’m talking about six to eight tracks – and I’m going to follow it up with an album after. I just finished up my first single for that, and I’m shooting a music video. It’s just exciting man; it’s an interesting project. People think of me as Eazy-E’s son, they typically think I’m going to try to bring that gangster music or that whole west coast thing; but in reality, I keep it more versatile. I talk about a lot of stuff that's going on in my life and personal experiences as opposed to portraying this lifestyle that I don’t live or glamorizing something that I'm not. So I’m trying to keep it as real as possible, and just really give people an understanding of who I am, while at the same time, still carrying that legacy that my pops left behind.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong><span class=\"s1\">I had an interview a while ago with <a href=\"http://aboveaveragehiphop.com/meet-chris-rivers-son-late-great-big-pun/\">Chris Rivers</a>. He was saying that he had to fight through a lot of misconceptions about his background, and what he should rap about based on the fact that his dad is Big Pun. Do you find like people have a lot of misconceptions about you as an artist?</span></strong></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">I always get that you know. I always get that comparison, and I even get that with my brothers. I got my brother Lil E and another one of my brothers who raps, and you know, people are always going to expect me to be doing the same thing that they did. I’m taking a completely different route; I’m sort trying to step outside of that shadow. People need actually to hear my music, and then they’ll be able to differentiate. They'll be able to see that I’m trying to make my name; but at the same time, I’m embracing my background. I think that’s one of the biggest things right there that you got to deal with, especially when you have a father that is so iconic, you know what I mean?</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong><span class=\"s1\">Do you have any memories of your father? </span></strong></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">My Pops, he passed away when I was five years old. So I was of age, I was able to remember the things that we did. I remember him coming over to my house out here in West Covina – and visiting my Mom and I. I remember the neighbours in the neighbourhood all flocked and were trying to take pictures and get autographs. It was just crazy you know; you got Eazy-E coming down here to visit his son and his mother. It was just so unexpected, people never really expect that you know. I remember him taking me to Chuck E Cheese and Taking Me to Toys R Us to buy me toys. I still have one of the toys that he got me when I was four years old. It was a white remote control car. I still have that in storage right now in a little box. I remember when we'd go out, it would be the same thing, it was always just crazy you know. To me, he was my father, he was Eric – daddy Eric. To everybody else, he was Eazy-E. I remember those times when we’d be going to the mall, and people would be over there like \"Oh my god I see Eazy-E.\" I didn’t understand, I’m seeing my dad on TV here and there, but I really couldn’t  understand how big he was. I didn’t know what was going on because I was so young.</span></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p class=\"p1\">\"I guess what I want people to understand, is that whether my father was Eazy-E or my dad was the mail carrier, I would still make music.\"</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">– Yung Eazy</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong><span class=\"s1\">Your mom did not want you to get into this music business – what was her concern?</span></strong></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Well, you know… I grew up in a really religious household. My family were Jehova’s Witnesses, so they were really against and opposed to me being in that limelight, and making that choice of career as far as me being a music artist and stuff like that. She just tried to take me in a different direction. We are religious; we don’t celebrate any holidays, birthdays nothing like that. I feel like that had played a big part in it. As far as dad’s music – of course – I couldn’t listen to that at a young age. You have to think about that explicit content and material, you know, imagine me ten years old listening to the Straight Outta Compton or Fuck The Police. So, she steered me in a different direction. It wasn’t like until I got older that I listened to my dad’s music. I had to hide it... I'd have it downloaded to my iPod or hidden on CDs. When I was older, I was able to grasp and listen to it and understand where my dad was coming from in his music. But, my influence came from a whole variety of genres, from rock and roll to RnB, rap, hip-hop – everything. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong><span class=\"s1\"> <img class=\"  wp-image-2376 alignright\" src=\"http://aboveaveragehiphop.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Untitled-3.jpg\" alt=\"Untitled-3\" width=\"231\" height=\"570\" />What was the first song from you father’s that you heard? Do you remember?</span></strong></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Man, the first song that I heard from my dad… I believe it was \"cruising down the streets in my 64…” [<em>Boyz N The Hood</em>] that was the first song that I remember hearing from my dad. I remember when I heard it, I knew that he was him, I was like “hey, that’s my dad right there.\" In 93’ when they had they whole beef with Dr. Dre and Ice Cube and my dad dropped <em>Real Muthafuckin G’s</em>, that was really big too. I remember there were times I would be outside in the street, riding a little skateboard and or playing ball with my uncles and they'd be bumping that song. They'd be like \"this is your daddy right here nephew, this is your daddy.\" I remember those times very, very clearly.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong><span class=\"s1\">What do you want that people to know about you as an artist?</span></strong></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">I guess what I want people to understand, is that whether my father was Eazy-E or my dad was the mail carrier, I would still make music. It's  something that I've always loved to do. I don’t feel like my dad had a big influence on my choice of being an artist; you know what I mean? Because like I said, my biggest issue right now is people comparing me to my dad and thinking I’m going to try to be like my dad. I don’t want that to be, the way that I’m perceived. I want people to be able to understand that I'm different. I’m trying to make music that people can relate to – and I want people to recognize that I'm very real and lyrical.  You know when you hear my music, you hear the difference, you see the difference. The biggest thing that I would want people to understand that this is my passion. Music is more than a dream to me; this is what I want to do, and I’m always going to do it no matter what.</span></p>",

    "content_html": "<blockquote>\"Lord have mercy, have mercy,\nI know I ain't living right and know I'm not perfect;\nBut, I gotta eat, so what I'm doing it's worth it.\"\n\n– Jay Rock\n</blockquote>\nJay Rock, much like his TDE comrade Kendrick Lamar was a slow-burn artist. By that – of course – I mean that he was heavily touted as next to blow for many years before the world saw/heard and appreciated what industry insiders saw in the Cali native. He was MTV's breakout artist in 2010, graced the XXL freshman cover years several years ago. As Kendrick's mythological status grew to astral-heights, and the reverence of the TDE roster exploded, so did the status of Jay Rock. His official sophomore release, <em>90052</em>, has been highly anticipated – and didn't disappoint.\n\nThe album grows on you with multiple listens and has a wonderful arrangement. In fact, it's reminiscent of classic albums like Dogg Pound's <em>Dogg Food</em>, which also used a bevy of cool transitions and interludes to weave together the songs into a cohesive cover to cover banger. It has a sonic quality you've come to love – and expect – from TDE, and only breaks character momentarily on the title track. <em>90052</em> [the song] sports an East coast, almost Shaolin sound/flow. The above transition and song-within-song arrangement comes into play on songs like the buttery bass filled <em>Gumbo</em>, and the Kendrick assisted <em>Easy Bake</em>. Both of which are in my top 3 on this disc. The third song would have to be the soulful <em>Telegram</em>, which I currently have on repeat.\n\nThis is an album that will definitely be talked about for years to come. Even though it's a sophomore release, to many new fans, it will be their first introduction to Jay Rock, and the sheer hunger in his bars may have them truly believing this is an official debut. But Busta said it himself on the neo-soul vibed <em>Fly On The Wall</em>:\n\n<em>\"We've been rockin' for a long time, Jay Rock /They ain't got a clue of the timing / I heard about you from Slay when you started shinin' / They ain't knowin' this our fourth collab from 2009.\"</em>\n\nDon't get it twisted, Jay Rock has been in this game for a minute – and now it's his time in the spotlight. If you didn't Rock with him before, you no longer have any excuses! <em>90052</em> is a must listen.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jRWsATUjt7U",

    "content_html": "I'm always on the look out for next-up artists to champion here on AAHIPHOP. This artist, Salvation is a 17-year-old Philly-upstart I've spoken about before. Since I last featured him, he released a full-length project called <em>Laidback Extremist</em>. I thought it might be an excellent opportunity to chat with Salvation and help you guys get a bit more familiar with his background, and his music. Peep the Q&A below.\n\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"450\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/playlists/134513387&color=ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false\"></iframe>\n\n<strong>How did you get into music?\n</strong>\nWell, I got into music around the age of 12. I was always into poetry, but one day I decided to flow over Beamer Benz or Bentley, and it's been my lifestyle ever since.\n\n<strong>Who are your influences in the game?\n</strong>\nSome of my main influences are, Nipsey Hussle, Kanye West, Lupe Fiasco, and J. Cole.\n\n<strong>How would you describe your style?\n</strong>\nMy music style is pretty versatile but lyrically, all of my songs convey some lasting message for everyone. Lyrics should hit hard regardless of the beat and flow. Some of my new favorite types of beats are electronic (somewhere between house, trap, and dance music) because they often represent my complexity.\n\n<strong>Tell me more about your new project.\n</strong>\n<em>Laidback Extremist</em> is the first body of music I've ever genuinely loved. It was the first time I ever went all the way in on a dream. I started around winter time in my writing process. Then I began to plan out a concept and strategy with a professional photo shoot, website, and merchandise. It was originally just going to be called a playlist, but the amount of effort I poured into this project led me to call it an album even though it is available for free. The whole Laidback Extremist album was a transparent statement for others to see how far I've come and how far they can come as well.\n\n<strong>What's your goal in the industry?\n</strong>\nMy goal in the music industry is to inspire as many people I possibly can. I know artists like Nipsey Hussle encourage me to reach my success every day. But for the thousands and millions who may not be able to connect with someone like Nip, there's Salvation. The goal supersedes money and sales. The actual benefit of the music will always be worth more.\n\n<strong>What do you hope people take away from your project?\n</strong>\nAfter listening to my new album, I hope people will understand that my brand is really about \"stimulating your mind, one step at a time.\" It's my slogan and I'm 100% serious about it. I want to make beneficial music, and if I can create a sound that can make the people groove and still give someone a new outlook on life, the album is a success. That \"Fisker\" video is coming soon by the way.\n\n<strong>Any shout outs?\n</strong>\nI would like to shoutout all of the young guys grinding in the game right now. Especially all the teenage guys and girls who came in this thing with no co-sign and still getting it.\n\n<a href=\"http://SuperSalvation.squarespace.com/\">SuperSalvation.squarespace.com/</a>\n<a href=\"http://Soundcloud.com/yoursalvation\">Soundcloud.com/yoursalvation</a>\n<a href=\"http://twitter.com/YBPhilosopher\">twitter.com/YBPhilosopher</a>\n<a href=\"http://facebook.com/Somethingaveragel\">facebook.com/Somethingaveragel</a>",

    "content_html": "<blockquote>\"Fight for your rights, stand up and be heard... You’re just as good as any man, believe that, word.\"\n\n– Salt-N-Pepa (from the song None Of Your Business)</blockquote>\nHip-hop music has had an abundance of fundamental shifts in sound, tone and subject matter over the past 40 years. Most have been so severe that they ultimately spelled professional doom for many artists who tried to keep up with the times by simply rolling over and – metaphorically – letting the styles engulf their being. Some of the most notable shifts were the rise of NewJack Swing, the rise of Gangsta Rap, the shift to Jiggy, and the most recent rise of drill and trap music. Golden era artists had it the absolute worst. While many were able to spot the sell-out nature of the almost gimmicky nature of many hip-hop sub-genres, and maintain a timeless backpack/underground aesthetic we still knock today, some of your fave rappers either went out trying to fit into the gangsta mold, or as new jack swinging casanovas in a fly zoot suits. To see any artist from the 80’s still making any sort of noise today, really speaks to their ability to make relevant music across all the sub-genres, and stay true to – and to see any female artists (in hip-hop) still maintaining relevance is, well, that much more remarkable. I’d like to take some time to focus on one female group in particular: Salt-N-Pepa.\n\n<img class=\"alignright size-full wp-image-2452\" src=\"http://aboveaveragehiphop.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/salt-n-pepa-510f00199631f1.jpg\" alt=\"salt-n-pepa-510f00199631f\" width=\"300\" height=\"320\" />At a time in history when hip-hop was largely considered a fad that major record companies were reluctant to prescribe to, Salt-N-Pepa took over the scene with the infectious hit <i>Push It</i>. Their debut album went platinum, which made them the first all-female group to reach platinum status. In fact, they were the first all-female group ever. They released a total of 5 albums throughout the course of their (recording) career, with none selling less than gold. Their fourth album, Very Necessary, was their highest selling effort, selling over 5 million records. How could it not? It had massive hits like <i>Shoop</i>,<i> Whatta Man</i> featuring En Vogue, and <i>None of Your Business</i>.\n\nAfter their final release <i>Brand New</i>, which suffered from failed promotion due to label folding, the ladies called it quits. Life went on; life after limelight took effect and there were (independent from each other) marriages, children, radio hosting, television shows, and, well, real life.\n\nWhat goes around comes around. The sharp resurgence in hip-hop nostalgia, which has seen groups like Naughty By Nature steady touring over the past few years, Salt-N-Pepa just couldn’t stay away from the stage. With a legion of fans worldwide hungry to relive their younger years, and new fans who caught the bug by hearing one of their timeless hits, they're still a heavy draw. Rightfully so, they wrote the blueprint for all-female hip-hop groups, and artists in general. They had bars, they could dance, they were liberated, empowered and sexual (without being at all sleazy or over the top), and above all, they made great music. They flourished in a time before the internet, so rather than be reduced to a series of singles, they have an untouchable catalogue of gems that goes deeper than Shoop, Push It and Let’s Talk About Sex.\n\nWe’ve taken the liberty of pulling together a Coles notes mix of some of our fave joints. <i>R U Ready</i>? Salute to the real <b>Queens</b> of hip-hop.\n\n<iframe src=\"http://www.audiomack.com/embed4-large/aboveaveragehh/salt-n-pepa-mixtape\" width=\"100%\" height=\"250\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe>",

They single handedly transformed the concept of what a rap group could be, and gave birth (or prominence) to numerous notable off-shoots, such as: Killarmy, Sons Of Man, American Cream Team, etc. It's refreshing to see a <i>new</i> generation of of artists are trying to carry the torch. TyFlow is one such artist.\n\nTyFlow, member (by blood) of the Cuffie Crime Family, is one of the Leaders of the next generation of Wu Tang's \" Cream Team.\" Jerry Pulaski, or North Tech, named him as the 2nd most exciting next gen WuTang artist to watch for. He's also a focused boxer – so he's nice with his fists. Together with Young Dirty Bastard, Radio Rah , iNTeLL(spelled like that), Justice and Don Staten, TyFlow is helping Wu Tang continue to be \"about the children\" for a new, younger, core audience.\n\nGive my man a spin on <a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/tyshawn-jones\">Soundcloud</a>, and <i>sound off</i> on our Twitter feed!\n\n \n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGTupeV16VU\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k7e5ArrswLU\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01tk4TQ5Qmc\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hGQFYmZUZU",

This week I have Eb&Flow, a young cat from Cincinnati with an old soul. Seriously, I'm often impressed with kids that have an old school aesthetic, but this kid damn near sounds like he's in the golden era. \n\nWhile reviewing the tracks he sent me, I was drawn to their basement demo-tape appeal that almost comes off as 'professionally amateur'. It's quite reminiscent of the shit you may have heard on a late night mix with Stretch & Bobbito back in 95'–96'. He has grimy production, and above all bars to match. \n\n<i>\"...that's ludicrous, not talking bout the side with them hits – I mean the stupidness when they assume they know what it is...\"\n</i>\n<i>– Eb&Flow from the track \"Homies.\"</i>\n\nHighly recommended listening is his ode to fake friends, <i>Homies</i>, and the laid back <i>She Always Askin'</i>. Give the kid a spin, and if your feeling his first four joints, then I recommend you jamming his 8-song project, <i>King Goldirocks</i>, for a more cohesive experience. \n\nFollow him on <a href=\"http://www.twitter.com/HeWhoFlows\">Twitter</a>.\n\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"450\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/users/48476488&color=ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false\"></iframe>",

They arrested him, and he fought his case in Maricopa County Jail for three years before finally being given the chance to bond out on 275k.\n\nNow, with a second chance at life, he's developed his music into his unique sound. He feels this is the best way to speak out against this epidemic and honor those who weren't as lucky as him.

    "content_html": "<blockquote>Look at Eminem -- when I met him he was like, \"I've heard of you!\". That was a testament to the hard work I put in to make a name for myself.\n\n- Percee P</blockquote>\nA few years back I was writing for another blog, doing a bi-weekly column called #DITC. I was, in essence, interviewing artists that I'd looked up, and talking about the state of hip-hop. While working on this wonderful interview I did with the \"rhyme inspector\" Percee P, I decided to split ways with the site. As a result, this piece was in limbo – until now. See below for my <i>lost</i> interview with Percee P.\n\n<hr>\n\n<strong>It’s dope to see your battle (with Lord Finesse), a piece of hip-hop history, on YouTube. The only thing is that the ice cream truck in the second video.</strong>\n\nYeah, yeah, I didn’t like that either! You know, ice cream trucks are trying to make money, so I guess he saw them people over there, and just pulled up like he didn’t know he was interrupting. I didn’t like it because I felt like I was being drowned out. I just kept going, but it was just like damn! You know what I’m saying?\n\nhttps://youtu.be/7URLSd-xkXc\n\n<strong>There’s a quote on a blog that says you’re the \"greatest rapper never to get his due. \" What was your experience trying to get on?</strong>\n\nI didn’t shop a demo. My whole career, I was never really trying to get a deal or shop to all these labels. I never did that. I never wanted to fall into traps, like all the other sucker artists getting down with labels and getting shelved. Not just getting shelved, but locked into contracts that restrict you from even putting out music. I looked at artists at the time like DMX -- I knew him personally, we were down with the same management -- who was doing his thing at the time. He put out a record on Columbia, but they didn't push it as well as they could have. I guess when they put out his debut (on Def Jam) they likely had to buy out his contract, but he was out for years before that, just on pause. So I just didn't want that happening to me. I’d rather hustle my music on the street. I'd rather do that than be stuck with people that don't understand me and don’t know how to push me correctly. Labels control artists, and how they come out.\n\nAny label that thinks of themselves as “hip-hop” – I think – should be proud to have even me as a part of their roster. For the fact that I have something that a lot of other artists can't buy. Even if they have more money, they can't but the experiences I've had in this game. I've lived hip-hop. I've seen a lot of stuff that people have to read about or look at DVD's to experience. As it stands all these influencers (labels/investors), really just judge people off of hype and not off of their stripes. Like if people were judged off of their stripes, people like me would be platinum.\n\n<strong>What's your take grinding to build a name/brand independently? Where did you draw your inspiration from?</strong>\n\nI grew up in that era when you had to get out there and do you thing -- sing/hustle on corners just to get known. So that’s me, and where I'm coming from. But nowadays, with the technology, I don’t need to do all that. I just need the views and hits. The downside is that sometimes people like/watch and download an artist (assuming they have legit views), but the fans don’t know them, or get to know them. When people talked about me, before I moved here (Cali) and even while I was in Cali, they'd say \"damn, he’s everywhere\".\n\nIt was important to me that people get more than just music. I rock shows and go through the crowd -- walking through by myself -- taking pictures, answering questions. No one knows your story better than you. Those are the ideals I got from my heroes -- the unsung heroes -- who weren't about the videos and all that. It wasn't about the about the hits and the views or the songs played on the radio. People that were ahead of his their time. Groups like Fearless Four, that’s what inspired me.\n\nBut I feel inspired by the new artists of today. People are making money pushing their own thing -- blowing up doing this. You don't need to rely on outside sources to make it happen for you. You can hustle and get die-hard fans to follow you. You don’t have to sell a million to be a millionaire; you know what I’m saying?\n\n<strong>Why do you think it's important for fans to support local/underground hip-hop?</strong>\n\nIt's crucial to support the artists, like myself that are still around, trying to preserve what you complain about. Like \"damn man they don't do this anymore, they don’t do that.\" When you got cats doing it still, preserve that, by…\n\n<strong>Helping support?</strong>\n\nExactly!\n\n<strong>How important is that (preserving the culture)to you? What role should artists/labels play?</strong>\n\nI think they should make it mandatory to know the culture of hip hop. Do you want a record deal? OK, this is what you got to do. You must learn the culture; learn it so that you can appreciate it more. Understand what they (forefathers of the culture) had to go through to do hip hop.\n\nThey didn’t have YouTube like you. You got videos and radio shows to hit up and people online doing blogs about you. They didn't. Taker a closer look and see what it was like back then in that territory; notice the condition and economic times they were facing. What they had to go through to live, the thoughts they had. They didn’t have the equipment we have now. Pro-tools and things like that weren't around, so learn what they had to create with and what they did to propel the culture. People didn’t have funding and people believing in them. When they were going through it, it wasn’t even a recognized form of music. Grown folks didn't know what they (the kids) were doing, making a bunch of noise out in these parks, heating people up. They sacrificed their lives to inspire others, and another generation. I’m one of those kids that were inspired because I felt positive things being done.\n\nThe parents might not have understood what was going on in the park, with thousands of people - but it made me say \"I wanna become this, I wanna figure this out.\" Do it on the mic, go to another project, and then another project. People got tapes of these unknown rappers blaring on box radios. They didn't even have any records, but they are playing recordings of them rhyming at a park or party or something. You know, that inspired me.\n\nTo think, if those labels (back then) pushed and made names of people like Africa Bambata, Disco King Mario, and DJ Pete Jones -- who passed away recently. People don’t know about them. You supposed to know who they are, like the way you know Jay-Z and Lil' Wayne. The kids know who they are. Not even just their names. They see a picture, \"Oh that’s Lil' Wayne, that’s Jay-Z\". It’s a crime not to know these people [referring to the architects above].\n\n<strong>What do you think needs to be done?</strong>\n\nAppreciate people sometimes. Don’t take me for granted like the air, the water, and the trees on the planet. If you can understand what I am trying to say. Most people just take that for granted. We all need the trees, you know, but if all the trees get cut down, everybody dies on the planet. See, I think like that, but people wait until the last minute before they try to divert things that’s happening. You know what I’m saying? Same thing with hip-hop music. Save it. Save it right now. There’s people still on the field, still trying to hold it up. Not holding it down but holding it up. Like yo, I’m still here doing it. I’m still keeping it hip-hop. Even if you think people are not really into (real) hip-hop, I’m still doing it. People say I’m trying to bring hip-hop back, but you know what? I am not bringing anything back because I <em>never</em> left in the first place!\n\nhttps://youtu.be/_WJrQ9lh6NI",

    "content_html": "Although the combination of Big Boi and NYC-based electro-rock-pop duo Phantogram seems unlikely on the surface, it's not that hard to swallow [pause]. I mean, Big Boi, was once partnered with Andre 3000 to form what had (eventually) become the most matched, mid-matched duo in hip-hop history. In fact, their final album, Speaker Boxxx/Love Below, was split into two completely separate albums – and the contrast between the two was staggering. What I'm getting at is that clearly the man isn't afraid to take chances, musically. Well, a pop-up ad, led Big Boi to Shazam the duo of Sarah Barthel and Josh Carter – and here we are! After months of teasing, and some epic performances, they officially dropped their self-titled EP.\n\n<i><a href=\"http://smarturl.it/BigGrams\">Big Grams</a> </i>is an absolute joy to listen to. What I appreciate the most, and I'm sure many listeners would agree, is that it delivers exactly what you think it will. They all live up to their individual strengths and deliver songs that are fun and incredibly dope. When an artist is truly enjoying the process and is genuinely inspired, it carries through to the music. <i>Lights On</i> and <i>Fell Into The Sun</i> have been knocking out of my speakers for the past few hours on repeat. Also, if you've ever dreamed what Big Boi may sound like over Premo-esque east coast production, you'll want to pump <i>Put It On Her</i> with the windows down in the ride. The only misstep for me was that Skrillex joint...meh.\n\nIt's a great listen, and the perfect way to kick-off the autumn music rush. If you can tear yourself away from Drake and Future, definitely <a href=\"http://smarturl.it/BigGrams\">drop this into your music </a>device and let it run around a few times.\n\n<a href=\"http://aboveaveragehiphop.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/IMG_9765.jpg\"><img src=\"http://aboveaveragehiphop.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/IMG_9765.jpg\" width=\"100%\" alt=\"\"></a> \nhttps://youtu.be/HM0qq_WtH7U",

A great deal of under-twenty spit kickers prefer to hone their sound to match the dominant sound of the day – and who could blame them. However, there are a lot of fresh faces popping up that have seemed to embrace the 90's era that many older fans hold dear to their hearts.</span>\n\nThe timing makes sense; if you were 20 something a backpack rocking, subway bomber knocking tapes you dubbed off Stretch & Bobitto – and you happened to get a woman pregnant – your offspring is now 15–18. It's unlikely that you taught them about anything except 90's hip hop, which helped them gain a different perspective than their peers on the culture as a whole. The result? Joey Badass, Astro, A-F-R-O, Bishop Nehru and youngest of the bunch, TJ Brown. They are the new breed of cats, much in the same vein as Sheyheim, A+ and Chi Ali were all those years ago. Unlike our heroes though, this new breed of rapper – armed with golden era aesthetics and sensibilities – have a secret weapon: the internet and social media.\n\nJoey Badass made <i>waves</i> (no pun intended) with his debut mixtape that caught the ears of heads like DJ Premier, and tastemakers a like. Astro blasted off (again, no pun intended) after his run on X-Factor. He’s since established his sound as unapologetically hip-hop. A-F-R-O is the most hyped wonder kid of the moment, capturing the imaginations of legends in the game with his (almost) unbelievably captivating freestyle skills. Literally, he had to prove himself. Lastly, TJ Brown is a youngster whose been setting my timeline on fire over the past few weeks dropping bars on classic records, and causing many to declare, “hip-hop is truly alive.”\n\n<hr>\n\n \n\nhttp://youtu.be/wGH_CX9Ys6g\nhttp://youtu.be/5BYb4iN8gO0\nhttp://youtu.be/KjTEf3jkxn8\n\n<hr>\n\n \n\nThere will never be another golden era as we all remember it, but this new class of young artists seem poised to create a new golden era that will inspire a new-new generation of artists to keep the spirit of hip-hop (as a culture) alive. Shout out to the parents doing the right thing, and the iconic figures in the game who are passing the torch, and knowledge, along to these young cats.\n\nHere’s to another 40 years of real shit!",

This grading system, though, has always had a flaw. It largely ignores the sheer amount of first-hand experience that one may possess – even without doing anything in particular. It also ignores the power of an average man. Not all rappers are trap dwelling hot-heads ready to pop-off at the first sign of beef. Some are just regular Joes, like you and me, with a unique ability to make relatable \"reality-based\" music that isn't forced or contrived.\n\nI'm <i>constantly</i> hunting for such artists.\n\nMeet A-B-E, also known as Abe the Profit. Coming straight out of the South Bronx, he was inspired by hip-hop culture and began beatboxing and rapping at a young age. He doesn't quite fit the mould of the average NYC spit kicker. He's mad educated, having earned his B.Sc. and M.A. at New York University. He's a published poet, has shared the stage with Harry Belafonte, Rosario Dawson, Dr. Cornel West, Rosie Perez, and others. Impressive right?\n\nHe's an activist, educator and speaker – and has performed/toured all over the world in the name of hip-hop. He recently released what he describes as his \"labor of love\", <i>A South Bronx Tale LP</i>. You can hear the work A-B-E's put into this project. It has great sonic appeal and traverses a plethora of subject matter, some of which is unique on the NYC scene.\n\n<i>Disconnected Youth</i>, for example, tells the tale of a young outsider, which I'm sure lots of youth can relate to. <i>Real With Yourself</i>, talks about the woes of the 9-5 struggle, but stresses the importance of staying true to your personal goals and dreams. The super deep <i>If I Should Die Tonight</i> is an open (final) letter to his loved ones and detractors. On the track <i>This Is For The Kids</i>, he plays the role of a too real for TV substitute teacher:\n\n<i>\"Christopher Columbus ain't discover America; he killed Indians – he’s a masked murderer!\"</i>\n\nThe real gems – for me anyways – comes at the tail end of the album. The relationship-themed <i>Work It Out</i>, the sexy <i>Chocolate Pomegranate</i>, the sax-driven <i>Speak My Truth</i> are must-bumps.\n\nAlthough his background may not what some of the more 'trap-aholic' heads today are checking for, it's definitely what they <i>need</i>. With a cadence that almost puts me in mind of Immortal Technique, and a very clever song writing style, A-B-E delivers a solid debut solo. I'd love to see him speak live one day – he comes across as someone with a lot to say!\n\n<iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/122307267&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true\" width=\"100%\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"no\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe>",

    "content_html": "<blockquote>\"They talking about a million, I'm talking about Infinity...\"\n\n—Baliva</blockquote>\nI've said it before, but I'll echo that I have a lot to learn about the UK music scene. I have to say, though, I'm always impressed with the level of talent I hear. My latest find from across the pond is <a href=\"http://www.balivamusic.com/\">Baliva</a>, a talented MC that wears his heart – and his faith in his sleeve. Born in Harare, Zimbabwe, he moved to London in 2001 to study media production and throw himself entirely into his pursuit of his lifelong dream of becoming a successful hip-hop artist.  On his journey, though, he faced personal struggles that eventually – at his lowest – saw the young artist become Christian, and focus on using his talent for good. His latest effort, <i>Imperfect</i>, is both culmination of this vision and a wonderful body of music.\n\n<i>\"Now people wanna act strange when you start to make a change but keep pressing on because my Lord will make you strong.\"</i>\n\n<i>\n</i><i>— Baliva</i>\n\nSonically the album has a blend of club/trap, backpack/street-hop, and Dilla-esque soundscapes over which Baliva delivers messages of self-worth, perseverance, and faith while giving a look into his innermost emotions. It's telling, honest and quite refreshing. Over songs like <i>Nothing To Prove</i>,  <i>Addicted To Approval</i> and <i>Million Dollar Vanity</i>, he tackles issues that range from social and racial injustice to the overall over-emphasis and reliance that many of us have on not only social media but 'things' in general. He's most telling though on songs like the touching <i>Broken Home</i>, where he discusses how painful it is not to be involved in his child's life.\n\n<i>\"My purpose is to empower people to live lives filled with hope, courage and freedom\"</i>\n\n<i>— Baliva</i>\n\n<i>Imperfect</i> is an audio manifesto, in which Baliva is showing the world who he was, and who he's become. He says best on the album's outro, <i>I'm Free</i>: \"this project marks a new chapter in my life.\" He's free from the constant people pleasing, and acceptance seeking that – frankly – plagues a lot of us. He's not forcing you to subscribe to what he's saying, rather describing a path towards a respective light he's found in his life. Whether you follow him or not, he's saved\n\nGives this brother a listen.\n\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"450\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/playlists/55815221&color=ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false\"></iframe>",

    "content_html": "<blockquote>\"...at the end of the day, we made some great f--king work.\"\n\n— The D.O.C</blockquote>\nThe Meek Mill and Drake \"beef\" – and I use the term loosely – exposed something it never intended to; it would appear that in 2015, people still don't read album credits. I've already spoken of the phenomenon of 'ghostwriting', but what about the phenomenon of just 'writing'? A very quick glance reveals that Drake's shadowy punchline pusher (or helper) is very much credited, so why isn't he more widely acknowledged for his contributions to Drizzy's platinum effort?\n\nThis is the same question I have when I think about platinum selling west coast (via Dallas, Texas) artist The D.O.C. He was an integral writing resource for the group NWA as they recorded their legendary <i>Straight Outta Compton </i>album. However, shortly after seeing the success of his own (eventually) platinum selling debut album <i>No One Can Do It Better</i>, he was involved in a near-fatal car accident, which left him with crushed vocal cords, effectively ending his career as a 'rapper.'\n\nThis didn't stop him, however, from becoming the pen behind NWA. With Ice Cube's departure, he stepped up and became a driving force behind their second and final, <i>NIGGAZ4LIFE</i>. He also wrote large portions of Eazy-E's material, and Dr. Dre's game-changing <i>Chronic</i> LP.\n\nOver the years, there were some ups, downs, fall outs and legal woes. Although, as news reports, and D.O.C himself confirm, he has regained the use of his vocal cords and is eyeing a return to the rap world. I was lucky enough to talk with the west coast institution about the NWA doc, the return of his voice and his place in rap history.\n\nInterview below.\n\nhttp://youtu.be/UiPbeIXZpD4\n\n<b>What did you think about Straight Outta Compton?</b>\n\nWell, I thought it was a great movie, and I support it one million percent. I went and saw the movie myself maybe two, three nights ago and enjoyed it.\n\n<b>Now, one thing I noticed about the movie is they touched your accident, your involvement with NWA is downplayed.</b>\n\nI don’t like to dwell on negative things. The first part you said was \"I was there\" and that… That’s all that matters to me, you know. That’s their vision; they decided to write that movie that way, and it was a great film. No, it was not a hundred percent accurate, but that’s what movie is? I support their vision, like I said, one million percent and when I get into my film, my version of those events, I hope they support me as much as I support them.\n\n<b>You’re a very prolific writer. A lot of people think about a ghost writer as someone that writes stuff behind the scenes – and isn’t credited. But, it’s interesting because you’re a ghostwriter in a sense that, not everybody knows that you wrote so much stuff for NWA. You’re entirely credited. </b>\n\nWell, Not actually fully credited but most of it I am. I’m not credited for any of the stuff on Eazy’s first album or NWA’s first album. My name never showed up, but everybody knows I did it.\n\n<b>If you look up <i>Straight Outta Compton</i> on Wikipedia, you’re listed as a writer.</b>\n\nYeah.\n\n<b>They’re just not paying you for it.</b>\n\nYeah, something like that. (Laughs) Something like that.\n\nhttp://youtu.be/9k1XyvwM4no\n\n<b>You’re kind of the main voice behind the group – and even the driving force behind Dr. Dre’s <i>The Chronic</i>.</b>\n\nWhat you’re saying is right, and you’re right. You’re totally on point. From my perspective, there is another story that’s interesting, compelling and yet to be told. So I think the time for it to start getting its light is upon us because so many people after that movie are interested. So many people are saying that like… \"who is this guy who's in the whole movie? We never see him do shit...what is his story?\" I’m working on a documentary right now. See, a lot of the stuff that you saw in that movie was the shiny part, you know what I mean, and the darker part you didn’t get to see. So, me exposing what I would refer to as the 'darker periods' of that successful era would make a very compelling movie or documentary.\n\n<b>The movie made it seem as though Ice Cube did most of the writing you know; they put a lot of emphasis on it. You were, in reality, a pretty important piece of that puzzle.</b>\n\nWell, I don’t want to toot my own horn, but toot-toot godammit. But, the thing that’s most important to me is being there and being part of that amazing time. Then, that incredible music. It means a lot to me that in the sense that we were young guys that were trying to face something that was bigger than us. That wasn’t a hundred percent our goal in life, you know what I mean, we were just young, we wanted to make this record and have fun. Public enemy pushed us in a direction that allowed us to express what we were doing in a way that can be channeled into something positive, so that felt excellent to me, and it still feels good. Although, like Cube said, they \"have the authority to kill a minority.\" They’re doing it – and they’re doing it at an alarming rate and it’s screwed up. What hurt bothers me is no one connected to the success is saying anything about it. It was supposed to be a staple of what this movie is about. The crucial part of what makes this an outstanding film was that it shone that light on America. It showed that thirty years later she's still a little bit of a fuck up, because she’s allowing this shit to go on.\n\n<b>Absolutely – and again I get it, it’s a Hollywood movie. I understand why marketers wouldn’t want to do that, but it seems like missed opportunity</b>\n\nYeah.\n\n<b><i>Straight Outta Compton</i>, I think, was number 6 on the Billboard last week...</b>\n\nWow!\n\n<b>And <i>Eazy Duz It </i>was number 42, you know what I mean?  Anyone or anything that was mentioned in this movie is selling.</b>\n\nNow I don’t want to take anything away from anybody – I think the success of this whole movement is magnificent and wonderful. I just don’t want it to come and go without giving something back to the energy that got us here; you know what I mean? Like, we learned a lot of lessons and even myself I went through a lot of shit during that time, it was a dark period of my life. I sacrificed a lot to those great records, and so I had to go through an alcoholic period and a period where I started using drugs. I made it through all of that, though, and I’m more focused and serious now than I was then – just with a different mind state. So, if I do get the chance to tell my story, I want to benefit more than just people who love gangsta rap, but everybody who is struggling too. Even people that are thinking about suicide, or just dealing with the fact that life is not fair. All those things will pass if you believe in yourself and push forward. Maybe thirty years later, they will make a movie about you. (laughs)\n\n<b>It’s crazy, and I mean, it must be gratifying to know that a lot of the stuff that you were making back then is still a hundred percent relevant now. It’s being consumed by another generation.</b>\n\nYeah, it’s pretty cool to be on Twitter and have some sixteen-year-old kid tell me that his father has made him listen to my first record and he loves me, it’s cool.\n\n<b>It doesn’t feel dated. It doesn’t feel old you know what I mean? It all holds up.</b>\n\nIt’s called timeless.\n\n<b>Absolutely.</b>\n\nThe key to making great music is to make it timeless. The stuff we did back then, it had no time to it, it was just had that feel to it, and that’s how I like to make music man. I just want to make great shit, and I wouldn't care if it was visual art, or music, or poetry. I’m just into making great art.\n\n<b>So you’re going to be making more new art in the future?</b>\n\nI am. One of the deals is that the accident that happened to me in that movie took my voice. It was taken from me, and for a quarter century my vocal cords didn’t work. I got arrested about two years ago, and I spent a year locked up. While I was locked up, by some blessing, those vocal cords were starting to move again on their own – and from there I could manipulate my vocal cords to make a solid tone again. So, I have a voice again. It’s not anywhere near strong, and it isn’t comfortable. It feels like putting your shoes on the wrong foot and walking because I haven’t used those muscles in fucking twenty-five years.\n\nBut I have been working on it, and I’m trying to build them, slowly and surely. I’m going to make new art. I believe that God gave me that blessing as a sign to tell me that it’s time to start talking. It has nothing to do with rapping or being the greatest rapper again, I’ve already done that. It has nothing to do with making these magnificent platinum records; I've already done that. I think it was given back to me because it’s time for someone to start talking.\n\nhttp://youtu.be/4QdgC6w0gL4\n\n<b>Absolutely and the time is now.</b>\n\nWe’re in an appalling place bro. We in the United States we are in a bad fucking place. It’s not going to get any better unless people – and I don’t mean black people, and I don’t mean white people, I mean everybody.\n\n<b>Everybody!</b>\n\nI mean if you don’t get your shit together and get your head out of your ass, and realize that there are forces that are working in this world that are trying to manipulate the future. They're making it so black folks and white folks will never really have the chance to get along – and white folks and Mexican folks or any of these folks will never have an opportunity at peace. Peace means that the power would be in the hands of the people. All power should be in that hands of the people; but, as long as the power is in the hands of the elite few then it will always be fucked up because they make the money. All of these Republicans are negative; they don’t know how to talk to people or about people, so I don’t want someone like that speaking for me.\n\n<b>It’s just a hamster wheel – If it’s not Trump, it’s another Trump.</b>\n\nThere you go bro; now you get it. Yeah, I vote for Kanye. (Laughs)\n\n<b>It’s all about new ideas bro, new ideas. (Laughs)</b>\n\nI don't want this to turn into a United Nations debate (laughs). Look, I’m proud of Cube, Dre and Yella and Ren and Eazy (R.I.P) for doing what they did. A lot of it was fucked up, and there was a lot of stealing, back stabbing, and goofy nigga shit. And, Jerry is not the fucking saint he pretends to be – but, it’s the music business man! It’s the business that we chose, and sometimes it gets fucked up, but at the end of the day, we made some great fucking work.\n\n<b>Timeless records that will never go away. Timeless records that almost thirty years after the fact are topping Billboard record charts.</b>\n\nYeah man, that’s fucking cool and shit. I’ll just wait now to get the fucking money. (Clears throat)\n\n<b>Are you properly credited on the <i>Niggas4life</i>?</b>\n\nYeah, I get everything after <i>Straight Outta Compton</i>. Now, I didn’t make any money on this movie, nobody asked me for anything, nobody offered me anything – and so I didn’t feel it necessary to chase these guys for anything. I’m happy for their success. I’m a spiritual person, and I believe that what was supposed to be mine will make its way to me if I continue to work hard for it.",

    "content_html": "Let's face it, the term DJ is very subjective – and that's probably the Internet's fault. But let's be clear when you're in the presence of a true turntablist, the difference becomes crystal clear. Kind of like drinking freshly squeezed orange juice. Real Mixtapes, by real DJs, were – back in the day – audio adventures that took the listener on a journey. Every nuance, including the track list, was laboured over, and the products stood the test of time. Kind of like classics by DJs like <a href=\"http://youtu.be/wzFmYx0jEBU\">Rectangle</a>, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL9dThdR6I6dPVZ7WdZ1TglNcRjUPRoIew\">Shadow</a>, or pretty much the entire Beat Junkies crew, just to name a few.\n\nNeedless to say, I'm a sucker for a well thought out, and seamlessly executed mix.\n\nOne DJ who I've up on for a while now is Eric The Tutor. He's in every sense of the word a You-Tube, celebrity DJ. Why do I say that? Well, his mixes have earned him over 64,000 subscribers, and over 15 million views. His themed 'best of' mixes, such as his Biggie, Tupac, D'Angelo tapes, and his epic 8-hour long old school hip-hop mixes have made him something of legend online.\n\nI reached out to Eric to learn a little bit more about his background in the DJ game, his influences – and how he feels about his You-Tube success.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/M2avwknGjBs\n\n<b>How did you get into DJ'ing?</b>\n\nI always wanted to be a DJ. Ever since I was a little kid. I think from the moment I first heard hip-hop and reggae in the early nineties I was hooked! I never looked into though until years later. I was busy running a tutoring company (hence how I got my DJ name), and one of my students' parents owned a DJ equipment distribution company. They were nice and hooked me up with some equipment, so I started practicing.\n\n<b>Who were some of your influences?</b>\n\nIt's hard to be from Montreal trying to become a DJ and not be influenced by whatever A-Trak is doing. He's such a force in the DJ/music community.  I always loved scratching, one of my first mentors was MTL DMC champ DJ mana – he was/is beyond technically skilled. I like to listen to everyone to get a feel for what they're doing, the direction they're going in, etc.\n\n<b>What was your reaction to the attention you started getting on You-Tube?</b>\n\nThe You-Tube success wasn't overnight, It was more of a steady grind; but, of course, it's great that so many people listen now. I think one of the most important goals of music (and why I got into DJ'ing) is to share it with as many people as possible. I get tons of people messaging me saying how they enjoy the music – and sometimes I get amazing, personal, inspirational thank you messages. Those are always the most gratifying. It's also given me a platform to connect with amazing people from around the world that I would never connect with otherwise, and I get to meet them when I travel, so it's great.\n\n<b>Of all your mixes, do you have a favourite mix?</b>\n\nI don't think I have a favourite mix. I listen to a bunch of my mixes, is that narcissistic? I listen to the D'Angelo mix a lot, though, he's my favourite artist, so I'm probably biased.\n\n<b>Who are your fave artists out right now?</b>\n\nMy current favorite artist is the Weeknd; I love the new take on r&b. J Cole raps a mean bar too – he's got a nice old school flow, but it sounds fresh. Oh, and that Jamie XX, Young Thug & Popcaan track <i>Good Times</i> has been on repeat for a minute!\n\nhttps://youtu.be/HTe8hjGAFn4\n\nhttps://youtu.be/Cy090ToFw1s\n\nwww.facebook.com/ericthetutor\nwww.twitter.com/ericthetutor\nwww.youtube.com/ericthetutor\nwww.mixcloud.com/ericthetutor\nwww.ericthetutor.com",

    "content_html": "<blockquote>\"I'm not fist pumping; I'm raising my fist.\" \n\n– Siimba Liives Long</blockquote>\n\nThe \"it\" factor is undeniable, unavoidable and can't be fabricated. No matter how much money you dump into an artist, if they aren't unique enough to truly stand out, then they'll have a rough time building a loyal fanbase. A relative newcomer on the scene, Siimba Liives Long, is one such with an undeniable \"it\" factor. An Ethiopian-American artist who was born in NY resided in Brooklyn and grew up in Addis (Ethiopia's capital) is about to take off – and for so many reasons. Here's three.\n\nFirst off, he's talented as hell. He has bars, and judging what I've heard from him this far, he seems to be along the vein of golden era inspired reality rap that artists like Joey Bada$$ inhabit; however, he has a unique sound. Second, he has a dope sense of style. Draped in traditional garb, and with a demeanour that almost puts me in the mind of late 90's Afu-Ra, he stands out.\n\nLastly, his first single/video <em>Cocaine Bimbie</em> off his upcoming sonic-series <em>Zemenay's Gemiinii</em> is flames. Even the fact that he calls it a sonic series is cool!\n\nThe video itself deserves all the attention I already know it's going to get. It premiered yesterday on Noisy and is a must-watch. I mean homie is walking around with lions and eating fire – it's hypnotizing. This isn't a \"rent lions and ball out in a Lear jet\" kind of video either. He's in straight up Africa, with lions! He shot the video in Ethiopia, South Africa and Brooklyn because they all play(ed) such a big role in his life and his journey. Also, again, keep in mind that he's an unsigned artist – so no fancy label budgets here. He still managed to make one of the dopest visuals we've seen all year. Just saying, though.\n\nSiimba Liives Long is an artist to keep on your radar. Just remember where you heard it first.\n\nhttp://youtu.be/hDVihQyv-MI",

A month or two back, I reviewed the debut mixtape by a young windy-city rapper by the name of <a href=\"http://aboveaveragehiphop.com/tooty-first-degree-murder/\">Toot</a>y . I was majorly impressed by <i><a href=\"http://aboveaveragehiphop.com/tooty-first-degree-murder/\">First Degree Murder</a></i>, and have been anticipating the release of his upcoming EP, <i>Suicidal Thoughts</i>, which drops November 24th.\n\nTo bridge the gap, and keep the heads appeased in the meanwhile, Tootie recently dropped visuals for the EP's first single, <em>Stepping Stone</em>. Produced by Von Vuai, the track is introspective, and sees Tootie walking through some of the circumstances in his environment leading to the manifestation of suicidal thoughts. It also has an astute message of perseverance: \"<i>Can't score if you don't shoot, I don't mind missing, because all my niggas gone rebound and grind with me</i>\".\n\nHe's showing tremendous growth already as an artist, and we're excited to take in his full 7-song project – produced entirely by Von Vuai – when it drops.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9F29MLiIiw",

    "content_html": "Hip-hop and comics are no strangers. From enlisting artists to create album covers, to just being book junkies, there has always been a strong relationship – and why not? They are two mediums built on the concept of storytelling. Their relationship took the front street and set the internet ablaze with the recent release of <a href=\"https://www.google.ca/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0CBwQFjAAahUKEwjN_5_js9nIAhWJ7iYKHTvXCxw&url=http%3A%2F%2Fcomicbook.com%2F2015%2F08%2F11%2Fall-of-marvels-hip-hop-variant-covers-in-one-place%2F&usg=AFQjCNEsNU5ESy5iAgJdnsckGh3CE_3x9A&sig2=17fZqx7odrryl9o7yS9Q2A&bvm=bv.105841590,d.dmo\">Marvel's variant covers series</a>. Accompanying all-new #1's from Marvel Comics coming this season was a variant cover paying homage to some of the most iconic covers in hip-hop's timeline.\n\nAlong that same vein, I came across another a dope artist I thought I'd share with everyone. His name is Beddo, and he's a visual artist from Toronto, who uses a unique combination of graffiti, comic book art, and traditional fine arts. He launched his latest for at FanExpo in Sept 2015 in the 6, and after being put on to him, I've been following his work on Instagram.\n\nHe's been focusing recently on 'reverse-variant' covers, which flip Marvel's concept. He uses his hip-hop to tribute iconic comic book covers, like Amazing Spider-Man #50 by John Romita, Iron Man #128 by Bob Layton and – current work in progress – Secret Wars #1 by Mike Zeck.\n\n<a href=\"http://aboveaveragehiphop.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/IMG_0613.jpg\"><img src=\"http://aboveaveragehiphop.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/IMG_0613.jpg\"  alt=\"\"></a>\n<a href=\"http://aboveaveragehiphop.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/IMG_0610.jpg\"><img src=\"http://aboveaveragehiphop.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/IMG_0610.jpg\" width=\"100%\" alt=\"\"></a>  <a href=\"http://aboveaveragehiphop.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/IMG_0611.jpg\"><img src=\"http://aboveaveragehiphop.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/IMG_0611.jpg\" width=\"100%\" alt=\"\"></a>\n<a href=\"http://aboveaveragehiphop.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/IMG_0609.jpg\"><img src=\"http://aboveaveragehiphop.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/IMG_0609.jpg\" width=\"100%\" alt=\"\"></a>   <a href=\"http://aboveaveragehiphop.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/IMG_0660.jpg\"><img src=\"http://aboveaveragehiphop.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/IMG_0660.jpg\" width=\"100%\" alt=\"\"></a>\nBeddo is currently working on his anticipated graphic novel <em>Udeja</em>, scheduled for release in 2016.

Well, you'll want to plan to hit up the <a href=\"http://coachellavalleywindup.com/phone/index.html#about\">Coachella Valley Wind Up</a> at the Saxony Convention Centre. It's a three-weekend party featuring the iconic west coast rapper Snoop Doggy Dogg.\n\nThe event, which has two shows slated, is dubbed 'Snoop Dogg & Friends', which is exciting because Snoop has <i>lots</i> of friends, and the possibilities for impromptu appearances are vast. Over the past 22 years since <i>Doggystyle</i> dropped, Uncle Snoop has released 12 solo records and a host of collaborative projects, and – thanks to putting his stamp on every medium possible – has become a cultural institution. From Death Row records to No Limit Records, to his work with Pharrell and his reggae album, he transcends genres; with over 35 million albums sold, he's easily one of the most recognizable and revered artists/personalities of our generation.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/_FE194VN6c4\n\nDon't miss your chance to catch Snoop and a bevy of special guests April 14th and April 28th. General admission and VIP tickets are available now. Added cool factor: he's going to be filming a live video at the event.

    "content_html": "Fat Beats, aside from being the go-to new york record spot for legendary DJ's in NYC during hip-hop's golden age, was also a congregation circle for underground emcees on the come up. In it's last few years, though, the employees of the vinyl haven proved to be amongst its best-kept secret. <a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/audibledoctor\">The Audible Doctor</a>, J57, <a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/soulkhan\">Soul Khan</a>, Koncept, <a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/deejay-element\">DeeJay Element</a>, <a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/eholladj\">E holla</a> & DJ Goo formed the <a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/brownbagallstars\">Brown Bag All-Stars</a>, a collective that has amassed an impressive resume, both collectively and individually. As of recent, two of the members, producer <a href=\"http://aboveaveragehiphop.com/interview-rapperproducer-j57/\">J57</a> and Queens-bred spitter Koncept have formed a metaphorical Voltron, and doing some serious damage with their new music.\n\nKoncept made a name for himself in the underground hip-hop trenches, but these days he's working with hip-hop goliaths such as Ty Dolla $ign, Pharoahe Monche, Royce da 5’9” and more. With <a href=\"http://aboveaveragehiphop.com/interview-rapperproducer-j57/\">J57</a> on the beats, he's preparing to drop The Fuel EP on November 20th, led off with the ultra-dope single <em>Porcelain</em>. I had the opportunity to chat with Kon about the project, his background in the game, his new label, and his skills on the one's and two's. Peep the Q&A below.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkznY1Pvu2U\n\n<hr>\n\n \n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>How did you get into hip-hop originally?</strong></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">I grew up in Queens New York. My next-door neighbor was a graffiti artist, and when my parents used to go out, they’d have him watch me. He got me into drawing and writing graffiti, and he gave me the name Koncept when I was 7. What my parents didn’t know back then is that they would go out, and he would take me out writing with him sometimes. So my first time I ever went out writing I was like seven years old. At age 11 I got my first turntables, which I still have – and still use. You know, I always liked writing. I wrote short stories and poetry. I used to freestyle for fun. I'd have a microphone that I plugged into my mixer, and I'd freestyle for fun when I was hanging out with friends and stuff like that; but, then when I started to write raps it was like I instantly fell in love. I got hooked and stopped doing everything else.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong><span class=\"s1\">I read before that you DJ. You don’t call yourself a DJ, but you have tables, you’ve had them for a long time, and you’re probably pretty good. </span></strong></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">[laughs] I used to watch DMC tapes, all the Scratch DVD’s and the Beat Junkies DVD; I loved scratching, like Q-Bert and all that. It’s funny, I was in my parent’s house about a week ago, and I was looking through some old stuff and I found some old CDs and cassette tapes. I was listening to some things that I did – and I was like, “This shit is dope!” [Laughing]. I was like, “Maybe I should start scratching on my stuff some more.”</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong><span class=\"s1\">I mean, look at Lord Finesse, he almost exclusively DJ's and produces now.</span></strong></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Yeah, yeah, yeah.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>Do you see yourself doing something like that in the future?</strong></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">No, I don’t think that I’ll ever do that. I have been thinking about doing some things — like maybe at shows in the middle of a set I’ll just sort of stop and then go behind the turntables and start scratching and cutting up records. Just do it as a surprise, you know what I mean? Because again, a lot of people don’t know about it so I think that would be something cool to add to the shows.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong><span class=\"s1\">You could start the set like that. Be the warm-up DJ, and then you just come out, no one would expect it at all.</span></strong></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Yeah, exactly.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong><span class=\"s1\">So maybe talk a little bit about Brownbag All-Stars. How did you get involved in the group?</span></strong></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">I think it was 2007. As a DJ, I’ve always bought records at Fat Beats, since the time that I got my turntables. One day I went in there to get some records. I walked in and J-57, who used to go by J-Logic, was playing beats in the store, <span class=\"s1\">and there were people rapping over them.\nI jumped into the cipher and started rapping. That’s how I and J met. We started talking; we exchanged phone numbers, and he sent me some beats. We became friends, and he got me the job at Fat Beats. Working at Fat Beats, there was a bunch of other employees, and it turns out that we formed our group called Brownbag All-Stars.</span></span>\n\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong><span class=\"s1\">That’s crazy. Tell me about the new EP and the process of putting it together.</span></strong></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">I dropped my solo album titled, “<em>Awaken</em>” in 2012, alongside a handful of music videos. One day, I got an email from Red Bull. They said that they found my music and wanted to bring me on as a Red Bull artist. I thought I was pretty crazy because, at that time, Red Bull was mainly in the extreme sports world. I was like, “Wow, Red Bull! That’s insane.” So I agreed, and a couple days later I got a big box of Red Bull [laughs]. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">They (Red Bull) hit me up and asked me if I wanted to be in this contest where they took all the people that they had as artists, and people would vote for their favorite artist – and the winner of this contest would get studio time down in LA. I ended up winning the competition. That was at the same time that J-57 and I were already talking about working on the next album where he was going to produce it all, and it was going to be all sample-free. So when we got this opportunity, we decided to be a group like a Gang Starr. You know, like Primo and Guru or like Blu and Exile. We just wanted a project where he produces the whole thing, and I do all the vocals on it. So they flew us down to LA, and we worked on the album. The album is called, “<em>Flight</em>” that is going to come out in 2016. We did the album, and our aim was just to make the best music of our lives. We finished the album, and the following week we were already sitting down with major labels.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">It was just a big turning point for us because we knew that we had made the best music that we’ve ever made, but we didn’t know, I guess, the extent of where it could go. So we took those meetings and all that, and then we flew back to New York, and that’s when we decided to record an EP to be the precursor to the album. So we recorded \"<em>The Fuel</em>. </span><span class=\"s1\">In that period, we had some offers from major labels and decided not to go that route and do it on our own. So that’s what we’ve been building. We’ve been building Kon 57 records for basically the last year and a half, two years. Now we’re getting ready to launch on November 20th and couldn’t be more excited about it.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2840\" src=\"http://aboveaveragehiphop.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/koncept1.png\" alt=\"koncept\" width=\"100%\"></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong><span class=\"s1\">What kind of propelled your choice to not go with a major label?</span></strong></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">You know, everything that we built has been in our control, we’ve done it on our own. We worked at Fat Beats — J worked there for 5 or 6 years, I worked there for like 3 ½, 4 years – and, you know, we built Brown Bag on our own, and we built our solo stuff on our own. We've done our own marketing, and done our own PR and booking. Honestly, we've worked almost every part of this industry. We've worked so hard on it, that to basically hand it over to a label and not be in full control was just something that we didn’t feel would be right and worth all this work that we’ve been putting in. So we know that it’s more work, obviously doing it on our own, but in the long run, it’s better. We’re in full control, have all rights to everything, and nobody is going to be telling us how to make the music or when to put the music out.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong><span class=\"s1\">So is it essentially a label? </span></strong></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">I mean, it is a label. We’re not signing any other artists or putting any other artists on; it’s just to put our stuff out. Hopefully in the future we get to a point that we’re at that we can help other artists out and put them on but for right now it’s just for our music.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong><span class=\"s1\">What’s your take on the current music scene in New York City?</span></strong></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">I think that the music industry now is lot stronger than it has been in recent years. I think that everything is looking good, and there are a lot of talented artists, a lot of avenues and a lot of people that are doing the right thing for it.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong><span class=\"s1\">Who are some of the artists that you’re checking for right now? </span></strong></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Joey Badass, Action Bronson... As far as New York artists. And of course, you have Fetty Wap everywhere.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong><span class=\"s1\">Yeah, he’s everywhere.[Laughing].</span></strong></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">He’s from the East Coast, can’t hate on that from my end. I’ll be honest: I didn’t know that he was from Jersey when I first started hearing him. [Laughing]. But it’s dope that he is.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong><span class=\"s1\">Do you have any last words at all you’d like to share with our blog? Anything else we should be looking out for from you guys?</span></strong></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">I mean, we’re going to have the second single coming out in the next week or two, and we have the video for that. “<em>The Fuel EP</em>” drops November 20th and we’re excited. You can pre-order on iTunes right now. The video for “<em>Porcelain</em>” is out. It just broke 100,000 views, which is insane. I can’t thank everybody enough. And yeah, we’re just excited.</span></p>\n\n\n<hr>\n<p class=\"p1\"><a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/ca/album/the-fuel-ep/id1032831888\">Pre-order </a><em>The Fuel</em> Today!

    "content_html": "True art, especially in our industry, takes passion. There are ups and downs – and periods of limbo where artists need to either find their style, or themselves. When it clicks, it clicks, and everything always falls into place. NYC-based singer, actress and filmmaker Leigh Fitzjames, also known as <a href=\"http://www.twinklesmusic.com/\">Twinkles</a>, knows this first hand. Her journey towards her upcoming full-length project has been <em>interesting</em> to say the least. From growing up in New Zealand, traveling her one-woman show, acting in various projects, producing a documentary to a lengthy limbo period where she anxiously awaited for her US visa to come through. She's now back in NYC, and working on making her dreams come to light.\n\nHer newest single <em>In My Dreams</em> is a haunting piano-driven blend of electro-R&B and raw emotion. It was produced by Flip Beatz, and mixed by Grammy-nominated engineer Lance Powell – whose worked with everyone from Wale to Miguel. Also – added cool factor – the super smooth track was recorded at Quad Studios, which you may recall was the infamous studio Tupac was leaving when he was shot the first time. That has nothing to do with Twinkles, but I had to mention it.\n\nCheck out our Q&A with <a href=\"http://www.twinklesmusic.com/\">Twinkles</a> below. She's super interesting and worth checking out!\n\n<hr>\n\n<strong>Tell me about your background</strong>\n\nI'm an artist from New Zealand. There weren't a lot of producers in my sphere, so I mostly did jazz and acoustic gigs for my time there before I moved to the States.\n\n<strong>How did you get into singing?\n</strong>\nMy first performance was singing the national anthem in front of my junior school. It was a duet that went badly wrong. I was 11 at the time. I felt so bad that I started working as a basketball referee to save up money for music lessons! Took me five years of saving but when I started, my teachers helped me with finding performance opportunities and I started hanging out with older kids making drum and bass tracks. School went downhill from there.\n\n<strong>Who are some of your influences?</strong>\n\nMusically: D'Angelo, MJB. Also lyrical geniuses who put on good shows - Al Jarreau, Passion Pit...there are so many.\n\n<strong>Can you tell me about <em>Love & Light</em>, and <em>Eight Limb Yoga</em>?</strong>\n\nI call it \"yogatainment.\" <em>Love and Light</em> is a play I toured CAN and US, and <em>Eight Limbs Yoga</em> is a movie I shot in India/NZ/US and is still work in progress. They're both about how yoga has become stupidly commoditized. I'm super protective about things that empower people to be authentic vs. retail-sex driven bogus disguised as spirituality.\n\n<strong>You mentioned in a vlog on your YouTube that in the period when you were working to come back to America, although you felt unsettled, you remained focused on releasing an album. What helped you maintain that focus?</strong>\n\nI focus on doing a little bit each day. Whether that's writing or following up with a collaborator, etc. It's the idea of making a new opportunity each day.\n\n<strong>Are you currently working on the album? </strong>\n\nI've made the first three tracks & vids for the EP that will be released in February, and then I'm working on more tunes to do the full album release after. Would be cool to get some big DJs to remix the current tracks and do some more producer collabos.\n\n<strong>What can we expect from it?</strong>\n\nAll the songs speak to \"in my dreams\" – hope and worry about the future. In My Dreams comes from me honestly believing any thing's possible (like combining classical baby grand with synths and submitting to major hip hop blogs). I know each possibility sounds like a silly dream, but I'm doing it anyway. That's the album - big ambitions that come with a \"sorry, not sorry\". Overall, though, it's a sweet sounding, a vocal driven blend of R&B/pop/hip-hop.\n\n<strong>Do you have any last words for our blog?</strong>\n\nAA++\n\n<hr>\n\n \n\nLearn more about her <a href=\"http://www.twinklesmusic.com/\">here</a>.",

If you consider yourself a 90s hip-hop head at all, you're likely familiar with The Artifacts, who crafted my fave hip-hop song of all time, Wrong Side Of The Tracks. Well, I follow both El Da Sensei and Tame on the Facebook machine, and they both post gold.\n\nEl, in particular, has been sharing some amazing memories and stories every #throwbackthursday. With his blessing, I'm committing to sharing some of them here with all of you! So here's this week's story courtesy El Da Sensei.\n\nThe following story – still in its original form – accompanied the video below.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLh7wXmNYbQ\n\n<hr>\n\n<i>I been looking for this one here...lil history behind this. Party Arty (R.I.P) brought this to my attention while on a 25 city euro tour with AG in 2003. While packing the van he screamed, Yo El you ever heard this joint..listen to ya man Jay Z before he starts his verse. I'm like oooooh wooooow. Is he saying what I think he saying? Cmon wit da WHAT? Get down wit the What? Lol that was humbling respectful and crazy!</i>\n\n<i>Years ago....on a bus to Morgan St College...Artifacts, Original Flava Ski Beatz Jay-Z, Leaders of The New School, Hard To Obtain, KMD, TCF Crew, Kurious to do a show there and back to NYC. long story short...me and Tame had a radio playing some of the album for Hard to Obtain then you here....Yoooooooo bring dat radio down here yo!!! Busta....we like word ok. We go to the front of the bus and busta snatches the radio \" Lemme see dat, y'all Artifacts right? I heard of yall on Stretch and Bob. Everybody staring and quiet. Dinco and Charlie watching. He rewinds the tape and listens to the songs. Get to Cmon wit da Get down and instantly the bus is like okaaaaay. He rewinds it like 8 times. Stops the tape and says...\" If y'all ever do a remix for this I wanna be on it\" Whoa!!! Whoooa! Bus is quiet now. He plays it again. Jay Z says \"Yo dats some shit right there. Beat is crazy. Whole bus singing the hook. Wow. Get off the bus. Do the show. We all get back on the bus. Its dark. No music ...out the darkness you hear \"Yo El! Yo yo...Play that joint again!!!!! Jay Z. Whole bus Cmoooon Get doooooown lmao. Will never forget that moment or day. Which led to Busta being on the remix like he said and here Jay Z singing the hook on this song at 2:18 . ‪#‎humblingmoment‬ ‪#‎life changing</i>‬\n\n— the above (verbatim) appeared on El Da Sensei's Facebook page.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fWY2baR08C0\n\n<hr>\n\nEl Da Sensei is currently grinding like crazy!

A posthumous release from the J.Dilla camp, Dillatronic is a 41 track sonic ride featuring all-new unreleased material from the undisputed messiah of underground hip-hop production. So why did I start this review off with a statement like this ain’t Donuts? Well, it isn’t. Donuts was a cohesive project, which had Dilla’s stank all over it, beyond the beats themselves, and into the actual arrangement and ora of the seminal example of what a beat tape <em>should</em> be. Dillatronic was produced by Dilla, there’s no argument there, but it lacks the same emotional punch that his earlier work had.\n\nIt’s better to approach this work for what it is, though – a beat tape. Had you chosen to purchase one of these beats, Dilla would have refined it for you likely – or in the case of the 30 and 60 second loops, finished it. Much like a notebook full of 2Pac’s scribbled lyrics and ideas, or old parchments that contain sketches by Leonardo DaVinci, Dillatronic is a collection of sonic sketches and ideas. They likely evolved into some of his more memorable pieces, or died at the cutting table and remained nothing more than a lost loop on an MPC formatted floppy sitting in a storage facility. It does have clearly brilliant stuff here! As I’m writing, I’m listening to the heavy vibrating bass of Dillatronic 29. Dillatronic 05, 12, 12, 17, 20-21, 32-33 and 41 are also must-listens. This is a tape that any and all MC’s need to bump and write to – and Dilla-fanatics need to add to their collection.\n\nDon’t pit this against Ruff Draft or Donuts – it’s not fair. this is an unearthed collection of Dilla beats that are perfect for a midnight ride through the city on a sticky summer evening. RIP to the greatest.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MPvEsFo7GE",

    "content_html": "<blockquote>“Imagine how I felt, opening the email, pressing play and being the first person to hear this new ODB music; It was surreal”\n\n– Mustafa Shaikh, Boombotix</blockquote>\nRussell Jones, also known as Ol' Dirty Bastard, was and wasn't a lot of things. He wasn't the most prolific writer. It has long been known that much of his break-out debut album had been written a few years earlier by both Method Man and GZA, but who cares. ODB wasn't a Drake-esque figure. Nobody loved Dirty for what he said per say, but rather how he said it. In a see of urban figures that seemed to blend, A-son was an unmistakable and unforgettable character. He was charismatic (which is an understatement) and seemingly untameable. ODB was cut from a cloth that many rappers have tried and failed to imitate.\n\nFrom <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BS181X4F3bw\">crashing the Grammy's</a> after losing out to Puffy, indecent exposure, or cinematic time on the lamb when he unexpectedly turned up at a Wu-Tang concert, he clearly did not give too many fucks. And classic footage of him walking <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ml5M9O_2Ngg\">barefoot in Brooklyn</a> and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KVatze-k7Bc\">collecting food stamps with his family</a> in a limo is also quite revealing of his mindstate in the mid-nineties. A more telling side, though, was seen when Dirty wasn't, pardon my French, fucked up. Breaks in character, such as his classic unearthed interview below, reveal a man who loved his <em>many</em> children so much he damn near tears up while talking about them. His super downplayed <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDXKvYQ3Xb4\">MTV doc</a> shortly before his death showed how much he loved <em>and</em> valued his family. It also revealed his insecurities about being in jail. Essentially, he was just a man – under all the bravado and antics.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjiMVJWUD3A\n\nHis legacy continues to live on, in part because his fans, family, and his Wu-Tang brethren keep it alive. Most recently, RZA and the wireless speaker company <a href=\"https://store.boombotix.com/products/odb-boombot-rex\">Boombotix</a> have released a limited edition speaker, which contains a brand new unreleased ODB joint called <em>Obey Me</em>. RZA officially signed on with the San Francisco-based startup last year, giving him an equity stake in the company and a hand in developing its line of rugged wireless speakers. They originally connected through one of the speaker brand's investors, and RZA and Boombotix's VP of Marketing, Mustafa Shaikh, conceptualized and released a limited edition Wu-Tang speaker with an unreleased Wu track at the top of the year – which understandably sold out in minutes.\n\nThis latest release came about when RZA mentioned to Mustafa that he may have some unreleased Dirty material laying around the basement on the Wu-Mansion. Just imagine having that conversation with RZA. Well, after a month of following-up, the Abbot went into the basement and unearthed some never-before-heard bars and sent them to Mustafa. “Imagine how I felt, opening the email, pressing play and being the first person to hear this new ODB music; It was surreal,” remarked Mustafa.\n\nMustafa tapped his friends at Fool’s Gold Records, and had Montreal-based producers <a href=\"http://foolsgoldrecs.com/artists/shashu/\">Shash’u</a>, and <a href=\"http://foolsgoldrecs.com/artists/high-klassified/\">High Classified</a> produce remixes to help package the new single, <em>Obey Me</em>, like an EP. “We're acting almost like a record label,” remarked Mustafa. Truly, it’s the most innovative way to sell a speaker ever! He and his team have accentuated the release by holding an ODB week, which was marked by the release of the single, a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOEDQmClHHw\">video treatment</a> and a super cool <a href=\"https://boombotix.com/odb\">app</a> that allows you to make your <a href=\"https://boombotix.com/odb\">ODB food stamp card</a> and share it online. The week is coming to a head with a party in NYC, which will feature good music, good people, and live art – which will depict ODB at various ages in front of birthday cakes.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOEDQmClHHw\n\nODB, always claim there was no father to his style. It’s well put, especially as we have a hard time finding a character who came pre-dated him that even comes close to acting as an influence. He’ll never be forgotten as long as real hip-hop still lives. This new single is just another notch on his legacy’s belt. It remains to be seen whether they will celebrate ODB week annually, but Mustafa notes that they do plan on releasing new music and collaborative projects in the future.\n\n<em>Rest in peace Ol’ Dirty</em> [*DJ Premier Voice]\n\n<hr />\n\n \n\nCouldn't resist, made my own ODB <a href=\"https://boombotix.com/odb\">food stamp card</a>!\n\n \n\n<a href=\"http://aboveaveragehiphop.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/5ykucj1q78yAAAAAElFTkSuQmCC.png\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2958\" src=\"http://aboveaveragehiphop.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/5ykucj1q78yAAAAAElFTkSuQmCC.png\" alt=\"5ykucj1q78yAAAAAElFTkSuQmCC\" width=\"100%\" /></a>",

    "content_html": "<blockquote>\"So when you get this Screw right her’, I want you to hold on to this motherfucke’. Cause we gon' come up in '94, you best believe that!”\n\n– E.S.G, Rapper</blockquote>\n\nOn the intro to DJ Screw's <em>3 In Da Morning Part Two</em>, rapper E.S.G warned that you should never – under any circumstance – take your eyes off your screw. The significance of that statement was rooted in a time that has long been forgotten in the sea of mainstream hip-hop and immediate media accessibility.  It also leads us to the origins of a young DJ Screw, and the grassroots nature of 90's hip-hop that ingrained itself into our hearts. Simply put, it's why we treasure the era so much.\n\nIn the early days of Screw, around the time that his signatures slowed down and chopped up style was taking over the Houston streets, he made a hefty living making personalized tapes. It may be hard for a 90's born millennial to imagine the world where you couldn't just burn a compact disc, but if you wanted to have the newest and/or rarest new music, and you wanted t to have that Screw stank on it, you had to go to the man himself. Unfortunately – he's was one man. And as you may remember, dubbing a tape is an extremely manual process. So, to create order, clients were asked to pony up the cash, and provide a list with your contact and requests/shout outs, etc. That list found its way into a shoebox, and then you had to wait until Screw got around to it. Hopefully, that makes the \"watch your screw\" sentiment a bit more contextual for you. Of course, today these tapes are priceless to their owners. \n\nHave you ever had to search for music. I'm talking manual search. Vinyl heads and 90's collectors will agree that the experience of opening a package, and popping in a new album/single while taking in the packing and album credits is an unparalleled experience. It’s an experience that’s been all but lost at the hands of MP3s and the immediacy of digital media in today’s landscape. The glimmer of resurgence is beginning to take hold as a new generation become infatuated with owning any and everything on vinyl, and visionaries like RZA, and Boombotix, who are working to bring a sense of tangibility back to the music industry.\n\nThis week, as we celebrate the anniversary of DJ Screw’s passing, we should remember his influence and  his carefree innovation that’s been loosely imitated by countless DJs – and artists – in popular culture. He’s a  symbol of originality that is sorely lacking in the game – and, as well, a sad reminder that overindulgence in illicit substances can be fatal. Let’s all give a salute to the father of New “Screwston”, and the capo of the infamous Screwed Up Click.\n\nWatch Yo Screw! \n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SH-gTefSiPU",

    "excerpt": null,
    "content_html": "Jadakiss is a formidable voice in the rap game. He has a distinctive cadence that would stand out in a crowd of a million rappers, and a track record that dates back to the days when B.I.G had NYC – and hip-hop – on lock. He's often been quoted as claiming himself top 5 \"dead or alive,\" which he takes to the next level with his aptly titled album, <i>Top 5 Dead Or Alive</i>. Bold right? The question is, does the album live up to that name? Well, in my humble opinion, no. Is it a good album? Yes.\n\nI'll explain.\n\nAlmost ironically, the album's second song, <i>The Shop Skit</i>, has a group of men discussing his (Jada's) accolades while getting lined up. One man remarks that \"he can't just rely on bars anymore.\" Why is this ironic, well, because it unintentionally – or maybe intentionally – sets the tone for the album. Top 5 DOA does little to stand out from everything else that's out now. Collaborations with Weezy, Jeezy and Future, are dope, but aren't anything special or innovative; however, they are lyrically dope. That's the conundrum I'm having with this album. Jada is on point; he just doesn't stray too far from the same few topics over and over, making it boring at times.\n\nThere are some dope joints here, though. He teams up with Styles for their signature back and fourth flow on <i>Synergy</i>, and he trades veteran bars with Mass Appeal head honcho Nas on <i>Rain</i>. As well, <i>You Don't Eat</i>, featuring Diddy, <i>Man In The Mirror</i> – and even the Nipsey and Ne-Yo featured <i>Ain't Nothin' New</i> – offer some of the J-to-the-muah 'Fung Shui' I was hoping for.\n\nTop 5 DOA? Well, with a few decades of consistency under his belt, it's hard not at least to put his name in the running. He's cut from a cloth that isn't quite appreciated as much as it once was. He's a super dope lyricist, but sometimes I find he panders to the mainstream more than I like. Overall, it's a solid effort – and worth bumping. If you're a Jadakiss' head, you'll be more than appeased.\n\nhttp://youtu.be/r3KKr2BvkGA",

    "excerpt": null,
    "content_html": "It seems as though skits are a lost art. Perhaps it's a sign of the times. The industry has become increasingly focused onsingles, and less focused on the development of cohesive projects; although, I guess that's not <i>entirely</i> accurate as of late. There have been some excellent albums dropping, but none have ultimately revived the subtle art of the skit, which saw some amazingly historic highs throughout the golden era of hip-hop. I thought it might be fun to explore some of my personal favourites, and the artists behind them. Here goes part 1.\n\n<hr>\n\n<b>WBallz – 187.4 FM on your dial!</b>\n\nAs far as skits and interludes go, Snoop Dogg and Dr Dre pretty much set the bar. From the infamous <i>Deez Nuts</i> skit to the more sophisticated WBallz 187.4 FM device that made contributions on <i>The Chronic</i>, <i>Doggystyle</i> and many of the notable releases from Death Row's heyday. The second example had DJ Sal-T Nuts, and DJ Eaz-E Dick (and the jack-off hour) – as voiced by <a href=\"https://www.google.ca/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0ahUKEwjq4deNlKzJAhVFmh4KHbUEDMEQFggcMAA&url=https%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FRicky_Harris&usg=AFQjCNEwjHrCKEN8hywIA1CbQq_MSbrk7A&bvm=bv.108194040,d.dmo\">Ricky Harris</a> –offering colourful commentary, fielding hilarious phone calls and setting up songs. Dr. Dre was also responsible for the skits/interludes on NWA projects, notably <i>NIGGAZ4LIFE</i>, and even the D.O.C's classic debut. No big deal.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BGbpTydDeU\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U76qz6D9XVU\n\n<b>Where my Killah tape at God?</b>\n\nWu-Tang's classic debut album, 36 Chambers, had a handful of skits, but only one became the go-to reference point for my grade school class. Raekwon and Method Man, immediately preceding the song Method Man, had a freestyle \"torture\" battle, naming comically horrifying acts they'd commit against each other. We're talking everything from force feeding to hangers left on stoves. Ouch.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhEyel2sw_I\n\n<b>This is a mothafuckin stick-up!</b>\n\nRedman is a real colourful character, and his skits lived up to his personality. From the possibly evil Dr. Trebis, mock newscasts in the city of Newark, to his over the top -- and in a few cases death-defying -- robberies, Redman seemingly spent just as much time orchestrating his theatrical (almost) breaks in action as he did crafting his actual classics.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SBNtlr3BgM\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oS8YnETBFqc\n\n<hr>\n\nBONUS:\n\nEarly G-Unit\n\nAt the height of the G-Unit and Murda Inc. battle, 50 Cent dropped these utterly amazing parody skits throughout his mixtapes (pre- Get Rich Or Die Tryin'). 50 may have gone a bit off-the-rails in the creativity department over the years, but these are a reminder of fun it was to listen to this beef in its entirety.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1_rjLqzfkkc\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dh5IgSrAUUo",

Well, the talks were true, and keeping her word, Erykah dropped her new mixtape on the world at midnight. If you're a fan like me, you were anxiously waiting for a \"green light\" tweet to storm iTunes and hop on the soul train. All aboard! It's a ride that was worth the wait.\n\nOff the top, I love EVERYTHING about this project; the cover, the arrangement, the loose theme, the fact that Drake is on two tracks – without any mention in the track listing – and just the overall feeling I get listening to this. After the intro, which has he chanting the classic punchline of <i>Tyrone</i>, she gets into the cover that creatively jumpstarted the project, which I skipped. Only because I'd listened to it about a million times by this point. Next was the proper studio version of <i>Phone Down</i>, which she premiered on Periscope a few weeks ago. The rest of the project was a completely fresh experience (double entendre intended).\n\nShe drops her neosoul take on the New Edition classic <i><a href=\"https://www.google.ca/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=7&cad=rja&uact=8&sqi=2&ved=0ahUKEwiQiZvRgLHJAhXDbR4KHTPsAvkQtwIIQzAG&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DVc0f6ZLDW2I&usg=AFQjCNHzqYFnCQPOyTP_2hjLS8_bmNJJag&bvm=bv.108194040,d.dmo\">Mr. Telephone Man</a></i>, and even a buttery electro-funk twist on Usher's <i><a href=\"https://www.google.ca/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&cad=rja&uact=8&sqi=2&ved=0ahUKEwiZ9ODcgLHJAhXJ7R4KHd-xAZUQyCkIHjAA&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3D3AszPTJXIgM&usg=AFQjCNE0umKe_YfvqZgYvOwQOikjmtIiGQ&bvm=bv.108194040,d.dmo\">U Don't Have To Call</a></i>. The highlight for me, though, was the Andre 3000 featured <i>Hello</i>, which seems to morph organically into the sonic elements of Sade's <i><a href=\"https://www.google.ca/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0ahUKEwiejcPlgLHJAhWBmx4KHeSFBuAQyCkIITAA&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DMmOau-PMWJk&usg=AFQjCNEmoViBIcM0DBfZFWh8cifd9yW-gA&bvm=bv.108194040,d.dmo\">Kiss Of Love</a></i> – a classic record that was the main ingredient of MF DOOM's <i><a href=\"https://www.google.ca/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=2&cad=rja&uact=8&sqi=2&ved=0ahUKEwi8luHzgLHJAhUDmx4KHfPwA2cQtwIIITAB&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3D5EtVJP0Dml4&usg=AFQjCNGSIhkXub_8VLLLO0kLAD7Fibhvng&bvm=bv.108194040,d.dmo\">Doomsday</a></i>. The project is stitched together with Erykah's signature interludes and melodies and reprises. It had a sound that would make for an amazing like show that I would pay upwards of $300 to see.\n\nI’ve been a fan of Erykah since <i>Baduizm</i> dropped in my grade 9 school year. I've followed her \"on and on\" ever since. What I’ve always admired about her is her ability to give her fans exactly what they want. She has yet to disappoint me. <i>You Caint Use My Phone</i> is no different. It’s relevant and immediate (recorded within the past month or two). She’s really good at using the internet machine, and this project is a great tangible example of that. Pop it in, double click (or, however you will bump this) and zone out as you knock out your Black Friday shopping!\n\n<iframe src=\"http://www.datpiff.com/embed/mdac2270/\" width=\"525\" height=\"270\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe>\n\n<hr>\n\n<strong>Bonus:\n</strong>\nErykah admitted that she encoded her actual phone number across the three covers she dropped leading up to the release. How cool is that? Let me know if you figure it out!\n\n<a href=\"http://aboveaveragehiphop.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/IMG_1691-0.jpg\"><img src=\"http://aboveaveragehiphop.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/IMG_1691-0.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"100%\" ></a>\n\n<a href=\"file:///var/mobile/Containers/Data/Application/1E313D71-AF75-488F-9AE5-D49EE7441FB2/Documents/Media/IMG_1692-0.jpg\"><img src=\"file:///var/mobile/Containers/Data/Application/1E313D71-AF75-488F-9AE5-D49EE7441FB2/Documents/Media/IMG_1692-0.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"100%\" ></a>\n\n<a href=\"http://aboveaveragehiphop.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/IMG_1693-1.jpg\"><img src=\"http://aboveaveragehiphop.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/IMG_1693-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"100%\" ></a>",

    "content_html": "Having a sound that is pleasingly varied or balanced is rare in today’s music game. It’s a new world, and with radio and selective regional sounds dominating the airwaves, it’s not uncommon to find artists that that seem to blend into the woodwork, regardless of actual skill. It takes a particular kind of business/creative mind to find a method of taking the popular sound of the moment and using it to give a very dynamic view of what an artist is all about, and what makes him/her tick. Enter VVS, an artist who I admittedly almost wrote off in the forgettable category. That is until I let his current project rock in its entirety.\n\nVVS – an acronym referring diamond grading of \"Very Very Slightly” – is a Tennessee-based rapper with two releases under his belt. Following the blueprint of his influences 3-6 Mafia and Master P, V.V.S. has a business mind and has built a solid, independent foundation. His <em>Pimp Edition</em> mixtape series earned him a Knocdown Entertainment award for Mixtape Artist of the Year in 2011, and his hit record, \"Polo Man,\" received spins all over the country. His newest project, <em><a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/king-me/id1028154901\">KING ME</a></em> is now available at all digital distributors. Take it from me, it’s worth more than a few spins.\n\nKING ME is all over the board, yet quite cohesive. It’s ignorant, explicit, reflective, and intelligent. It paints the picture of a man who is living the lap of luxury, while dealing with the slightly deeper emotional scars and baggage that can only be earned through dealing with the gritty lows that come with the shiny highs. He comes off braggadocios on the title track, and sonically lives the life (on wax) you’d expect of a trap star over the catchy <em>FML</em>, and lead single <em>Mac’n</em>. However, it’s on tracks like the heartbreakingly honest <em>Spill My Guts</em> where he shows his real personality – and contextual background. With lines like “ due to life’s strain, I’m immune to pain,” you start to get a clearer picture of why his mind works the way it does. He also (on the same song) details his rocky relationship with his mother, the women in his life, and his backstabbing friends. There’s also the searing <em>Never Change</em>, which describes his distaste following a bitter falling out with one of his day-one cats, “I was the one that fed you, boy, I kept you safe – you turned crooked, I was the one who kept you safe.” He is also extremely self-aware on the track <em>Cheating</em>, where he details the karma involved in his cheating ways with lines like, “I know my bitch cheating… I gave her about a hundred reasons.”\n\nMany artists dabble in the trap style and fail to create the starting power it takes to build and grow with their audience. VVS puts his whole self out there, and it works. I may have failed to articulate it thus far, but the production on this project is top notch. Perfect for cruising around the city with the windows down. Don’t judge a book by its cover or an album by its sub-genre. This project is a diamond with a grading that matches his name.\n\nEarly! \n\nFor more information on V.V.S follow him at <a href=\"http://www.twitter.com/VVS_MacN\">www.twitter.com/VVS_MacN</a>, on <a href=\"http://Instagram.com/vvs_macn\">Instagram.com/vvs_macn</a> and visit the website <a href=\"http://www.officialvvs.com\">www.officialvvs.com</a>.",

    "content_html": "History has shown that the most successful artists in hip-hop history have worn multiple hats. Whether that means heading label, businesses (like Rick Ross’ Wing Stop for example) – or even making a go at other forms of media such as film, TV or radio. In today’s fickle marketplace, and as hip-hop/music has evolved into a billion dollar industry, not diversifying your portfolio seems almost irresponsible, especially if your goals involve longevity and financial stability.\n\nMeet Son of Tony, whose stage name is in loving memory of his late father. He's quite an interesting artist – especially when we're talking about \"diversity.\" Aside from multiple releases, including his most recent <em><a href=\"https://t.co/qmpnCO2fM8\">The Son And His Father</a></em>, he’s also a veteran radio host in Ohio, who helped start and co-host <em>Flip & Flex Radio</em>, and <em>Xclusive Vibe Radio</em> on Power 109.9. He’s a well-rounded cat, with a determination to get his messages out to the masses – by any means necessary. AAHIPHOP caught up with him to chat about his career and his latest music. Check the interview below.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=48&v=9X8kjptgbCE\n\n<hr />\n\n<strong>How did you get involved in hip-hop music?\n</strong>\nI got involved in music through my family. Always hearing what they were playing around me – and songs that caught my attention during big scenes in movies. It helped to influence me. I started writing at ten. I just never saw myself serious about it until 2014. The most natural gift I have, I never chased. I got involved in music to change my life. Something in my confidence changed. I just know I make the kind of music that can compete with what's being played today.\n\n\n<strong>You're an interesting artist because you're also an established radio personality. How does that influence your approach to music?\n</strong>\nRadio changed my approach to music. I listened to so many submissions for the station, I heard so much lack of respect, copycatting, and false promotion of the unworthy, I set out to change that. I focused on releasing a project I knew would get a response. I hosted a radio show on Power 1099, Flip & Flex radio, in Ohio last year called Xclusive Vibe Radio. This was a significant turning point for me. Not just because of the profession or listeners, but because of what was being said in so much of the music. So, I started writing and recording about my life. It's personal, it's Hip Hop, but I’m in it for the money and the opportunities. Somebody, somewhere, can relate to at least one song on the project. It was written with a worldly view. Having radio and product to sell is a force to be acknowledged. It changes the odds a little.\n\n\n<strong>How did you get into radio? What is your take on the role radio plays in today's hip-hop landscape?\n</strong>\nWhat radio considers to be hot today is not a true reflection of the total climate of Hip Hop. It focuses more on sound, hook, dance, and fashion. Not substance. Not the message. Sometimes we have to remind people that Hip Hop originates from the streets of New York. That Hip Hop will always belong to the streets. No matter how much globalization you attach to it. This music landscape is fickle. So many underground artists never get the shot for that great talent because it's about how much can be made off you and your image. It's about money, not talent. And this makes it tougher for us all.\n\n<strong>Tell me about The Father & His Son project.\n</strong>\nThe Son And His Father Tape is different. The aggression. The beat selection. The content. For a debut project, it's incredibly versatile, while remaining true to the messages. It's real life. It's cinematic. It's violent without overkill. Raw and honest. My life put out there for all to hear. The pain and glory of it all. Somebody has to carry the torch for the people who make music this generation can relate to. So many concepts to choose from. Any one song is full of discussion matter. They will all understand the strength of this project in due time. There’s a lot of new music that’s out to compete with. I'm holding steady. \n\n<strong>What are your goals as a music artist?\n</strong>\nMy goal is to reach the underdog. The downtrodden. The abused and forgotten. The poor and rich alike, though. There're levels to my music. I want to sell out arenas. Collab with greats who helped to mold the culture. I want to be known as one of the authentics. The one with original style, sound, and subject matter. In short, I just want to be the best artist I can be, without selling my soul. That's not negotiable.\n\n<strong>Do you see yourself remaining independent – or pursuing a major deal? Do you think labels still matter in 2015?\n</strong>\nWho's to say if the right situation comes along that I won't sign with a major. Until then, I’m independent. I'm unsigned. I'm hungry. If you’re not in this for the money, why be here? I'm writing, recording, and performing until I amass a fortune. And yes, labels still matter. Those are machines with all the avenues and unlimited resources, but independent still matters too. We still set trends and the \"bar\" as well.\n\n<strong>Do you have any last words you'd like to leave our readers with?</strong>\n\nBe sure to check out <em>The Son And His Father</em> tape, now on <a href=\"https://t.co/qmpnCO2fM8\">iTunes</a>, <a href=\"https://t.co/qmpnCO2fM8\">Apple Music</a>, Google play, Amazon, Datpiff, etc. and follow me on Twitter at <a href=\"http://www.twitter.com/onofTonyUSSR\">@SonofTonyUSSR </a>\nNew visual on <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8kjptgbCE\">Youtube</a>.

    "content_html": "Can music truly be intelligent, positive and banging all at once? Well, a spin through your local radio dial shouts loudly, “NO.” If you’ve been following the most recent shift in the industry, though, you’ve probably noticed a new breed of golden era sensibility creeping back into the mainstream pipeline, leading to a new crop of artists who have bars – and an excellent chance of actually gaining recognition. There’s also been a shift from the singles-era into a new day where artists seem to once again care about creating cohesive, solid, complete projects, rather than disjointed compilations and sloppy mixtapes. It’s a great day for music fans.\n\nOne of the latest artists I’ve recently discovered in this vein is Malcom Crittenden, aka M-See, who hails from Historic Selma, Al. At a tender age he developed a passion for music and rhyming – and some years later he's dropped his third project, <em>Soul Food: Music For The Soul</em>. With a solid foundation of mainstream radio spins and buzz under his belt, this new project delivers a healthy dose of faith, reliability, sensibility and genuine love for hip-hop.\n\nFrom the album's title track, we’re instantly introduced to the fact that he’s using soul food as a metaphor for realness, down-home/ homegrown music – as a stark contrast for the more manufactured \"fast-food\", to which we’ve become accustomed. M-See comes off with an almost melodic flow. I’ll try my best to sum up his sound, but it’s a bizarre blend of Andre 3000, Drake, A slowed down Twista and a young T.I. There are moments that don’t particularly stand out on this album; however, on songs like More Than Money, he sets himself apart with straight up bars like:\n\n<strong><em><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\">“I think it’s come time, to show you that I'm bright like the sunshine; take over the world, and when I’m done, Imma have a son and show you how my son shine.”</span> </em>\n</strong>\nM-See does shine when he steps away from the mainstream influence and gets real. Songs like <em>One Time</em>, <em>No Justice No Freedom</em>, <em>Prayer For Sel</em> and <em>Morning</em> show off his pen game, and gives listeners a deeper look at what he has to offer the game. Standouts on this album are the bassy <em>Don’t Lie to Me</em>, and the super dope <em>Paper Cutz</em> (which is a <strong>must listen</strong>).\n\nSitting at 19 joints, the album is a pretty heavy plate of soul food to get through – and maybe could have been two smaller portions. Regardless, it is a solid, and cohesive listen. You can tell that M-See took his time in the kitchen – as you can hear the quality. Once you make your way through <em>Soul Food: Music For The Soul</em>, you’ll want to check out his other LP, <em><a href=\"http://www.cdbaby.com/cd/msee?SourceCode=widgetbaby\">Malcolm X, A Soulful Experience</a></em>.\n\nThis is that type of food that sticks to your body – grab a plate!\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUit6GEj9wM\n\n<hr />\n\n \n\n<iframe style=\"width: 100%; height: 520px; border: 0px;\" src=\"http://widget.cdbaby.com/7165b6e4-7eee-4e3c-8eb8-72bcb31da47c/full/light/opaque\" name=\"full\" width=\"300\" height=\"150\"></iframe>",

    "content_html": "There's something to be said for truly creative souls. You know, the ones who never stop thinking, never stop creating, and who's passion can never actually be extinguished. In this business, there are artists in it for the money and fame, and others who would do what they do, no matter what – because it's not what they do, but who they are. France-born and LA-based singer/songwriter SoShy is one such creative. Over the course of a phone interview I recently conducted with her, I could feel the passion in her voice.\n\nIf you're not familiar with her work, please know that she's by no means a new jack in this industry. She initially signed a deal with Sony music around a decade ago, which mainly developed her songwriting skills – and helped to break her in as a professional artist. After moving to LA (from NYC), she signed a deal with Universal, and more specifically, with Timbaland. Her deal was meant to be not only for her solo work but also for her to work with Timbo and Universal to craft material for other artists. She officially introduced to the world on the track <em>Morning After Dark</em>, which appeared on Tim's <em>Shock Value 2</em> album.\n\nShe's since dropped her solo project,<em> Crack The Code</em> on a Montreal – Canada – based label, and made waves with the singles <em>City Of Angels</em>, and <em>Whateva Man</em> featuring Novel. In the midst of continuing to work with other artists on the writing side, and feverishly recording material for her upcoming album dropping in the New Year, she took some time out to talk with us here at AAHIPHOP. We chatted about everything from unreleased material with Mark Ronson, working with AZ, and more. Check out the interview below.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbwqFlmsRdw\n\n<hr>\n\n<strong>Do you find it difficult to balance working with other artists, while still working on your music?</strong>\n\nNo, I don’t actually. Because one feeds the other. It took a while for me to find the dynamic in my writing. It’s about making sure that I don’t confuse both but, rather, keep them connected somehow so that whatever I can’t do for myself – because I need to keep my sound together – I can give to others.\n\n<strong>Do you find it kind of liberating in a sense, doing it for other people? Like, you can go places you wouldn’t necessarily go with your name or brand attached to it...</strong>\n\nThat's true. I think that it allows me to express myself in a way I couldn’t do with my own thing. It’s selfishly generous because in a way it feeds <i>me</i> – I kind of need to be needed. As an artist, if I'm true to myself, I need people to need me. I need to feel useful as an artist, as a vessel. At the same time, I just need to share things with others because I'm someone that’s going to die one day, and just want to make sure I can water certain seeds. Some of those seeds will serve certain artists, their journeys, and their situations. It’s very gratifying to do that, and yes, it’s therapeutic and liberating in a way.\n\n<strong>Have you ever had a weird experience where you were working on something for someone else, and became overly attached to it? </strong>\n\nIt's incredibly funny that you're asking me this question because this just happened. This is so weird right now; this is mystical. So, yes, I was working on an artist. I'm not going to say her name. I didn’t end up working for her because of a geographic reason. I was not able to make it to Portugal (she’s a local artist out there). I was asked to write a couple songs and see where it goes. There was one song that I wrote, and I was really in the middle of my own thing. So that was recent, let’s say a couple of months ago. This song that I wrote, honestly, I realized instantly that it was just too personal. Again, I'm not going to say too good; you know what I mean? Because yeah, I write for others what I would write for myself. It had the same energy and the same soul. But I was speaking from such a personal and very subjective standpoint that I was like, this thing is too much of my baby for me to let it go – and the artist agreed. It will probably end up on my new album.\n\n<strong>When you write for other people, do you often write from a personal place or do you just get to know them a bit and write something tailored for them?</strong>\n\nThe thing is, I didn’t get the chance this time to get to know the artist. It was a very cold order if you see what I mean. There was no human connection or interaction between the artist and me, because I think if that had happened, I would’ve probably really nailed it for the artist. I would’ve put myself in her shoes, and it didn’t happen like that. So I think that’s why I had more distance. Usually, I do need to interact with an artist.\n\n<strong>How did you connect with AZ?\n</strong>\nI connected with AZ through Baby Paul (Paul Hendrix ). He's a producer who was involved in classic records by Nas, Smiff-and-Wessun, AZ and more.  He was also an original member of the Beatminerz. So, I connected with them not because of AZ, but because of wanting to work together over Instagram. He hit me up. I didn’t know him personally – he just said, we should just work together. It wasn’t really for my project, just in general. We did some tracks, and one of them was <em>Back To Myself</em>. I didn’t know where it was going to go. I had no idea. And so, he said, \"I want it to sound kind of like this song.\" He gave me a reference, whatever. I said,  \"say no more.\" I took a couple days. I wrote the hook. The whole thing was really about coming back. It’s a redemption song but in a street way. When AZ heard it, he jumped on it.\n\n<strong>That’s beautiful. This is probably really hard but who have been your favorite artists that you’ve worked with?\n</strong>\nThat I've worked with? Here's a few:\n\nMark Ronson was one of the people that I looked up to for a very long time. He wasn’t as big at the time. We're talking 2003. We did a few songs that we never released. They were amazing songs, and I think that at the time… but at that time, it wasn’t where we wanted to go. I know Mark felt where I was going to go as an artist. There was just a clash between the label and what we wanted to do in the lab with Mark. However, it was an amazing experience. We met in London a year after and we still keep in touch. We talked about making a record together. I wanted to have him for my album.\n\nJohn Legend was a great experience. I wrote a song back when I was at Sony called <em>Without You</em>. It was supposed to be just for me. I was at epic and John was at Columbia at the time – he still is. He heard that, and he wanted to jump on the song. So we met in London, and we recorded – it was very flattering. I mean, it was an honor for me to have him. We’ve been very good friends since then. Estelle, too. Back in London I had the opportunity to work on her project.\n\nI mean obviously Timbaland. You know, I can’t forget about him because he is a big influence. I grew up on his records. I grew up on Aaliyah, I grew up on Magoo and him, and Missy – and for me to be a part of that even for a couple years is a blessing for me. I aspire to be a producer too at some point; I'm working on it. Being able to be in the studio and watching him at work was humbling to me.\n\n<strong>I love that you said Magoo, because no one ever says Magoo. He is the dopest; I don’t care what they…\n</strong>\nI don’t care what they say, dude. First of all, I will always stand for the underdog, number one, because I always feel like I'm one, too. But number two, I think he’s a dope rapper. He’s been very, very misunderstood. I think he’s dope. I don’t care what people say, he’s corny, he’s weird. I think he’s amazing. Whatever they did together, it worked.\n\n<strong>Every time. Everything they did was on point.\n</strong>\nExactly, so underrated. I <em>never </em>leave him out. I don’t know who else, I mean there’s so many – just working with AZ. AZ is a legend; you know what I'm saying? AZ is not lazy. He’s a hardworking guy. He’s one of those underrated artists. I'm telling you, his comeback, his book he just released, and the Doe Or Die anniversary album... He’s back in a major way. It’s dope to have worked with him.\n\nI also have to talk about Novel. Novel is a producer; he produced for Alicia Keys, Leona Lewis, and more. We’re talking big songs. He’s an amazing, rapper, singer. He produced a couple records of mine, including the song <em>Whateva Man</em>. He’s one of the people that mentored me and helped me understand music in different ways. I'm very blessed to know him. It’s humbling to be recognized and acknowledged. I probably forgot people because ... I've had a chance to work with a lot of amazing artists, so yeah.\n\n<strong>What do you want people to take away from your music? What do you want people that don’t know about you to know about you?\n</strong>\nI don’t know if there’s anything I want them to know about me except for the fact that I'm truly genuine with what I do. Every time I'm going to release a song, it’s going to be extremely real to me and also true to the reality and the world I live in. I wouldn’t call myself a conscious artist, but I'm a conscious person. Meaning, when I write something, it has to be conscious. We cannot just talk about flowers and rainbows. At the same time, I completely don’t commend all the gangster rap and any gangster shit that’s going on. Whether it’s in hip-hop, rock or anything. I just want to heal people. I want them to feel better about themselves. I want to empower them. I'm trying to be a vessel here. I don't want people to watch me shine. I'm trying to bring some light and bring some truth, and honestly, that's the only thing that I want people to say about me.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LC5ua4wS2Uk",

    "content_html": "<blockquote>\"...That's what I believe in, and I'm willing to die for it. Period.\"\n– Will Smith.</blockquote>\nI've written a number of times about Chicago native [notice I didn't call it Chi-raq?] Tooty. His management team initially put me onto his debut mixtape <a href=\"http://Tooty – First Degree Murder | Above Average Hip-Hop\">First Degree Murder</a>, which I optimistically reviewed. Tooty, I recall initially thinking, was an unexpectedly dope listen; he comes off quite focused, and confident – especially for a newcomer. I've been buried in music over the past few weeks, but I've finally been able to sit with his follow-up, <i>Suicidal Thoughts</i>.\n\nThe seven song project is kind of...dark, to say the least; although, at the same time, quite motivating. The album has a therapeutic aura about it, almost as though I'm listening to a (slightly) more uptempo version of Biggie's <i>Suicidal Thoughts</i>, with added psychological context. Coming from his first album, it's tremendous growth. Von Vuai's production perfect – and gives the album depth and consistency.\n\nTrapo provides bars on the project opener, <i>Underground Railroad </i>– and XVRHLDY lends himself to my fave joint on here, <i>Mile Before Perfect</i>. <i><a href=\"http://aboveaveragehiphop.com/tootie-stepping-stone/\">Stepping Stone</a></i>, which I talked about earlier this quarter when the visuals dropped, is another must-listen. He also drops serious nuggets on the Aaliyah sampled, <i>All I Think About</i>: \"I might slit my wrists tonight, I might fuck your bitch tonight – I can't be your Superman, baby you my kryptonite.\"\n\nAggressive. Reflective. Cautionary. Tooty delivers a solid follow-up to his debut mixtape – and sets the bar for himself this upcoming year. Much like the Will Smith excerpts in the album's outro, Tooty knows who he is, and what he believes. He is living in pursuit of his dreams; and If the underlying messages in this album are to be believed, he's also willing to die for them!\n\nGive it a spin!\n\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"450\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/playlists/158335722&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true\"></iframe>",

    "content_html": "Hailing from Houston, Texas – home of legendary crews like UGK, and the infamous Screwed Up Click – comes <a href=\"http://www.tbrmusic.com/\">TBR Music Group</a> a collective featuring rap duo Chain$moke (Mikey O.D. & Kelly Indica) and solo rap artist Spayc3. Although all three of the artists within this music collective have unique personalities and approaches, they all share an immense love for psychoactive substances. In fact, they have it listed as a musical influence, leading the collective to develop a dark, expressive and laid back sound. This sound can be heard throughout their new EP, <em><a href=\"http://www.tbrmusic.com/#!contact-high/lv2n0\">Contact High</a></em>, which is due to drop New Year’s Eve – great news for y’all smokers out there.\n\nThe EP, which sits at a mere five tracks, gives a great introduction to the trio, who bob and weave over bassy, trunk rattling production. It’s the sound, quite frankly, I've come to expect from Texas (not a bad thing). True to their mantra, they don’t stray too far from hazy rhymes that are so potent, you’d think you could smell the OG Kush through the speakers. The guys shine especially hard over the dark production in <em>Colorado</em>, which sounds like an audio road trip to the state that grossed so much money after legalizing marijuana, they’re developing ways to give some of it back. It's their modern-day mecca. My fave joint here is the slightly more uptempo/bouncy <em>Set The Record</em>, where they explain: \"<em>Don’t keep many friends because they all become enemies in the end.</em>” It’s all about crew love. \n\nI’d love to see them try some slightly different production, just to hear how their chemistry, which they’ve seemed to perfect on this EP, reacts. <a href=\"http://www.tbrmusic.com/\">TBR Music Group</a> are relative newcomers, but their careers go back quite a long way; and even before joining forces, each member of the group boasted an impressive background. When asked about working as solo artists, the crew explains, \"<em>when musicians join forces for the sake of producing great, uncompromising work, anything can happen.</em>”\n\nTouché. Check the latest single, and be on the lookout for the EP on NYE.\n\n[wonderplugin_audio id=\"2\"]",

    "content_html": "It was around 13 years ago when the neighbourhood pusher proclaimed that he \"pumped bass like that, jack.\" In the time since the Clipse shook up the industry with their debut single <i><a href=\"http://youtu.be/TjWAWcx4xdE\">Grindin</a></i>', much has changed for the VA duo. For starters, they split ways (amicably). Malice decided that rap was no longer a positive outlet that he wanted in his life while King Push made a solo go at it. Since 2011, he's dropped some official – and street – projects; however, his latest <i>Darkest Before Dawn </i>is maybe one of his dopest yet.\n\nThat's pretty fluffy, I mean, it's easy to say that about any artist's newest release. But the project is special, and Pusha is at his career apex. In 2015, he released the EQT Running Guidance '93 collaborative<a href=\"http://www.gq.com/story/pusha-t-black-market-adidas-sneakers-black-friday\"> sneaker with Adidas</a> and was recently named President of G.O.O.D Music, which he details on the not-so-subtle <i>Untouchable</i>.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/NPI_6MX74j4\n\nHere're the goods on this album; if Evidence of the Cali-based Dilated Peoples is referred to as the <a href=\"http://youtu.be/fYpjplfkaZc\">weatherman</a> for his incessant references to the weather, than Pusha is truly the dope man. If there were a record for most colourful cocaine references and metaphors ever, he'd be the champ – hands down. This album does see Pusha break into some more varied topics, though, such as loyalty, authenticity, morality and the tribulations of a black man with a pocket full of cash. For instance, he details the pitfalls that come with fame on <i>M.P.A </i>(Money Pussy Alcohol), where he talks about the depressing cycle and poor decision making that can get rappers caught up: \"The three leading killers of you niggas, be the shit that's most appealing to you niggas.\" He then details how he lost his first two million dollars on the must-listen collaboration with Beanie Sigel, <i>Keep Dealin'</i>, and also gets busy with re-up gang partner Ab-Liva on a super buttery Timbaland-produced, <i>Got Em' Covered</i>. The album also boasts production from Metro Boomin', Boi 1da, Kanye, Q-Tip and Puffy (no big deal).\n\nWith over a decade of hot music and a list of accolades under his belt, Pusha has earned the <i>king</i> title. One of the most telling overtones of this album is his denouncing of rappers who aren't speaking from a plateau of truthfulness. If the <a href=\"http://youtu.be/vK8e9F4ZzEI\">CNN special</a> he and Malice did a few years back has any validity to it, they lived that life. Like Jeezy, he's one of the real ones. His references to illicit drug sales seem less far removed if you consider that he went from that to <i>this</i> – albeit, not overnight (but still). He now likens himself as 'reformed'. A kingpin who can afford to have his mother spend a month in the Bahamas. 99% of these rappers, though, ain't got it like Push. On <i>Darkest Before Dawn</i>, he throws his hat into the ring, and shows why he's so revered by your fave rapper's fave rapper. It gets me hyped for what dawn will bring.\n\nLong live King Push!\n\nhttp://youtu.be/crCFDQyfORM\n\nhttp://youtu.be/o4bEwg5dB60",

    "excerpt": null,
    "content_html": "First things first, I hate lists. I'm not a fan of \"countdowns\" around this time of year, as they're WAY too subjective in nature, and often result in tons of shade from other fans, writers and – well – urban Twitter on a whole. For this reason, I'll simply be sharing a list of five albums I found significant this year. Please note, this is my personal top-five, and may not necessarily reflect the entire team. I'll share some of the how and why along the way, as well.\n\nHere they are, in no particular order:\n\n<strong>Action Bronson – Mr. Wonderful</strong>\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=debIyWS6Byc\n\nDoes Action Bronson sound like Ghostface? Yes, kind of. Do I care? No! Much like Shyne, he has little control over his vocal cadence. So what other obstacles do you have blocking you from enjoying this man's music? Exactly.\n\nDo yourself a favour and give him an honest listen. I first got into Bronson off of SAAB Stories and then began digging through his past catalogue. More than his music, though, his overall brand is on point. From his Fuck That's Delicious series – and – his videos in general to his upcoming book, he's using what used to be a hobby to help him fuel his true passion, which is food/cooking.\n\n<em>Mr. Wonderful</em> is a dope listen to cover to cover. From dropping salty-ex boyfriend slang on<em> Blue Eyes</em> with Chance The Rapper and skating the fine line of mainstream hip-hop with the 40 produced <em>Actin' Crazy</em> to the dreamy flow of <em>Terry</em>, he delivers a well-balanced meal for the real heads –flavourful, with tons of spice. See what I did there?\n\n<strong>Wale – The Album About Nothing</strong>\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMdgPJSlAQ4\n\nI was into this album before it even dropped, just because of the promotional campaign. The videos with Jerry Seinfeld on WorldStar, the spread in Complex – it spoke volumes about what we can/should expect from Wale. From the beginning, his affiliations always painted a vivid picture of the hype that surrounded this man, from his early collaboration with Lady Gaga (when she was at the top of her shit), to this relationship he'd seemingly struck up with one of the wealthiest and more respected comedians in the game. Wale is at that level, so not taking one of his releases seriously seems irresponsible on our part.\n\nThat's the message he projects, anyways.\n\nThis album was underrated in my opinion. I felt like I didn't see enough chatter about it. When I tell you that I could not stop singing <em>The White Shoes</em> in my head for the latter part of the year, I'm not exaggerating. The album cleverly uses monologues and conversations with Jerry, and clips from the show as a jump off points for an honest, and at times heartfelt, collection of music. Covering topics that range from marriage to police brutality, This album is another cover to cover kind of project. Recommended listening includes: <em>The Glass Egg, The Girls On Drugs,</em> and <em>The Pessimist</em> featuring J.Cole.\n\n<strong>Joey Badass – B4D A$$</strong>\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stoLqWXsIOY\n\nEvery generation needs a Nas and Joey kind of fits that mould. It takes a special kind of artist to get DJ Premier school-girl-giddy hyped – just saying. Not that nobody else under 25 was on the wave, but Pro Era has certainly made it cool as fuck for kids to excavate the 90's and mine that nostalgic sound into their records. From the first time you hear Waves, you just knew this kid was special. B4D A$$ was highly anticipated, and rightfully so; the album lived up to the hype, and gave fans exactly what they wanted: realness.\n\nIf you can honestly listen to <em>Paper Trails</em> and <em>Big Dusty</em>, or – shit – even <em>Save The Children (</em>which kicks-off the album), and tell me he isn't talented as hell, then we can't be friends. The album sounds like Joey built a time machine and recorded it in a dusty NYC basement circa 90's aesthetically, yet it's relevant, immediate and oddly innovative. This kid is only 20, wrap your mind around the damage he's going to over the next decade.\n\nStop blaming kids for killing hip-hop...\n\n<strong>Kendrick Lamar – To Pimp A Butterfly </strong>\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-48u_uWMHY\n\nKendrick Lamar is a difficult artist to listen to – for me anyways. I like to immerse myself in the culture but am often turned off by things that have too much hype surrounding them, à la Drake for example. Maybe it's the perpetual hater in me. As a writer, I often feel like I don't need to convince or cast too much opinion on universally accepted norms because yawn (what's the point). What I'm getting at, is that I feel like <em>not</em> liking Kendrick means something is wrong with you, because he's the best. It's hard to walk into his music objectively.\n\nThis album, though, was brilliant. It was – in all honesty – a brutal listen. It was powerful, and at points uncomfortable; however, it was honest, and ridiculously well executed. He refuses to sit idly amongst the rocky climate of today's reality on the streets of America. While some artists within the circumference of his apex may decide to make \"art\" that seems to serve as lifestyle branded commercials for opulence many of us will never experience, Kendrick did a great job of showing not only his artistic range but his ability to swim upstream (so to speak) and not get his crown wet. It's a must-listen, period.\n\n<strong>Lupe Fiasco – <em>Tetsuo & Youth</em></strong>\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2BWfN1nORU\n\nLupe Fiasco has certainly had a frustrating go at music over the past few years. Honestly, I'm not afraid to say I hated Lasers. It felt very watered down and lacked pretty much everything I loved about Lupe on his debut and <em>The Cool</em>. He seemed to lose his way, and to add injury to insult; it sold amazingly well. This album, though, <em>Tetsuo & Youth</em>, was his opus – and seemed to display a Lupe that real heads who have been watching him for years knew he could be. I liken him to Goku, powering up in the mountains before becoming a super-sayan.\n\nThe album is daring, immensely detail-rich, and devoid of any overbearing need for commercial recognition. It's artistic, inspiring and a must-listen for artists and \"real\" heads alike. Lupe plans on releasing 3 albums in 2016, so let's hope he stays in this lane for the whole trip.\n\nEarly. [drops mic]\n\n<hr>\n\nRunners-Up\n\n<strong>Drake – <em>If You're Reading This It's Too Late</em></strong>\n\nI can't front, this album, which Aubrey dropped out of nowhere, is hype as hell. If you exist – and like hip-hop – you've heard this album, and don't require my co-sign. I just wanted you all to know that I'm not a hater, even though I fail to recognize Drake very often here on the blog.\n\nHe doesn't need me – at all.\n\n<strong>Pusha T – <em>Darkest Before Dawn</em></strong>\n\nJust dropped a review of this album last week. It deserves all the recognition it gets, and I can attest that everything you've heard about it is the truth. Pusha T delivers his best project to date. Get your hands on this ASAP (like Rocky).\n<h2>What were your fave albums of 2015? Tweet me and let me know!</h2>",

We've seen many indie cats take the game to the next level over the past few years; young rappers like Mac Miller and Joey Badass have used the power of the Internet to build followings outside of staunch label structure we've become accustomed to. NYC native Yahiness is another such mind, who is poised to do big things this year. He's is Co-CEO and the first recording artist of The Arkk 7 Inc., a creative firm that dabbles in music, films and media. The 25 years old Southside Jamaica Queens native has been featured on MTV2's <em>The Sucker Free Countdown</em> and on MTV2's <em>Weekend Jams Hot 16</em>.\n\n<img class=\"alignleft\" src=\"http://nebula.wsimg.com/c4d0d153b439e4b63435359bc793cf9c?AccessKeyId=1598370BC87557044659&disposition=0&alloworigin=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"240\" height=\"240\" /><img src=\"http://\" alt=\"http://nebula.wsimg.com/e68e5eacc33c37259b46a19334016e5b?AccessKeyId=1598370BC87557044659&disposition=0&alloworigin=1\" />Late 2013, he dropped his 4th Mixtape, <em>TRAIN OF THOUGHT</em> -- Produced by Dav beats, Doe Pesci, Tha Jerm and The Fourth Coming -- hosted by DJ ENUFF, famously known for being Biggie Smalls's DJ. The seven track project received attention from well-known hip-hop sites and blogs. It was also nominated for the mixtape of the year award by Xtreme104fm in 2014.\n\nYahiness was offered a deal -- but turned it down because he wanted to remain independent. Brave, right? Early 2015, he and his father created the company The Arkk 7 Inc., something they've both been planning together for a while. He sees it as a blessing to be a young CEO and to be able to chase his dream, while keeping his family by his side as they work together.\n\nKeep your eyes and ears on Yahiness.

I don’t want to be stuck in that...with my beats sounding like dinosaurs.\"\n\n-- VDon</blockquote>\nThe digitization of the industry has changed the way we interact with the elements that go into making the music we all love – notably the artistic credits. Often we can go through a large number of (digital) tracks, many improperly tagged, without becoming overtly aware of the hands behind the boards making your head nod. As well, streaming services like Spotify and Deezer fail to detail the production credits correctly. Maybe that's what helps young producers like the Harlem-based VDon stay so humble. Although he's not (yet) a household name, he has a resume that most producers will live – and die – without topping. So far, he's worked with names like <a href=\"https://www.google.ca/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=3&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0ahUKEwjN55SKuJPKAhWEKB4KHQjICusQtwIIKDAC&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3D4QKFpgOU3lw&usg=AFQjCNEUCszodjkCbv8gxQIdHxCPL1zY6A&sig2=ChIW25-BdE24EZQa34yyRQ\">Bodega Bamz</a>, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8s7R3p-dIc\">Trae The Truth</a>, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ElFQddu-3c\">Styles P</a>, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iFp4Hsh3pVU\">Black Rob</a>, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5itP6j58fE\">A$AP Rocky</a>, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oapHePW9_9Q\">Smoke Dza</a> and many more.\n\nI recently had a wonderful chat with VDon, discussing his background, his 2016 aspirations, and his latest EP, <a href=\"https://www.google.ca/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=4&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0ahUKEwit5_efuZPKAhULpB4KHQXSA6sQFggqMAM&url=https%3A%2F%2Fitunes.apple.com%2Fus%2Falbum%2Fthe-opiate%2Fid1046266485&usg=AFQjCNEXmHi9Ui_swjsJzRpZ3tS7hMGkig&sig2=VY8cXPniDmCf_qoZa1B83g\"><i>The Opiate</i></a> – featuring <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLoZ8QavoAA\">Dave East</a>, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2JSva6gKdA\">Dark Lo</a>, and others.\n\nCheck out the interview below, and grab <i>The Opiate</i> <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/ca/album/the-opiate/id1046266485?app=itunes&ign-mpt=uo%3D4\">here</a>.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AgLejgGKFdI\n\n<hr>\n\n<strong>How did you get into producing?</strong>\n\nI got into it because my pops was a local DJ. He always had equipment around me, like keyboards, drums – that’s how pretty much I started. He used to try to teach me how to make beats when I was around 12-13, but I just wasn’t interested at the time. I didn’t get into it until I moved out of New York. I moved down south for about three years. I was bored out there because I'm from the city, so going down south was a different pace. I started making beats; I was sending my beats to my friends back in New York, and they were telling me, \"you got talent, you need to keep it going.\"\n\n<strong>Who was the first artist you produced for?</strong>\n\nThe first artist? Well, there were two that happened around the same time. I did a track with Jae Mills (YMCMB), and I did a track with Ransom.\n\n<strong>How did you connect with them? When you first started doing it, was it just you going around handing out beat tapes, that sort of thing?</strong>\n\nI was doing that, and back then when I first started, I had a partner. We were like a professional duo. We would make beat tapes and hand them out; we would also get into studios. We knew people from the streets too, so that led us to meet lots of artists. Harlem is a small place...\n\n<strong><img class=\"alignleft\" src=\"http://cdn3.hiphopsince1987.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/v-don1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"294\" height=\"294\">It’s interesting because I'm in Toronto, but I’ve been to New York a lot. People don’t realize that it’s a big city, but it’s a small place at the same time.</strong>\n\nYeah, New York is just the scene man. That’s another reason I moved back too; I knew I had to work towards getting the artists I wanted to work with, so, I moved back. You know just being out in the city you're going to bump into rappers, you're going to bump into people. That’s pretty much it. In the music scene, everyone knows somebody through one person or another.\n\n<strong>What’s your process? Do you sell a beat and walk away? Are you hands on?</strong>\n\nNow that I got my studio in the Bronx, I like to be hands on. I mean, if the artist is in another state – and it’s my homie – I hit them up and send music over email. Lately, though, I’ve liked having artists see me in person, you know, especially if we’re in the same city.\n\n<strong>That's a whole different experience.</strong>\n\nIt’s a different vibe when you're there with the artist, sharing ideas with each other. As far as making the beats, I like to be by myself creating/preparing them –and then when the artist comes through I just playing a bunch of stuff I have. I can make beats on the spot too.\n\n<strong>Can you talk a little bit about <i>The Opiate</i>?</strong>\n\n<i>The Opiate</i> is pretty much a compilation of all the artists I’ve been working with for the last 2 to 3 years. I just decided instead of me being on everybody else’s projects, giving them beats, let me put together my EP. It just happened that we had extra songs that artists didn’t use for their projects, so I ended up keeping them, and as well, I had collaborators come into the studio to sit down and work with me. I just molded how I wanted it to sound. It's a showcase of my beats really.\n\n<strong>Which is dope, I like that. I like the emphasis on the producer.</strong>\n\nYeah, I appreciate it. Thank you.\n\n<strong>So what else are you working on? What else do you have in the works?</strong>\n\nI got a few tracks with Dave East that are unreleased, I'm trying to do a project with him, and I'm attempting to work on a project with my boy Dark Lo from Philly – we’ve been talking about doing something. And top of 2016, I'm aiming to get some high profile placements. You know, I'm trying to continue doing EPs. I don’t want just to do one track on somebody’s mixtape anymore. I'd like to handle most of their production; you know what I mean? I’m looking forward to working with new artists too.\n\n<strong>Would you more prefer to focus on one artist? That changes the vibe of an artist...</strong>\n\nThat’s really what I want to do for the majority of 2016. I think that’s how a producer gets an identity and how they can separate you from other producers. I enjoy doing that. I like doing a whole project. This past year I just did <a href=\"https://www.google.ca/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=3&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0ahUKEwjN55SKuJPKAhWEKB4KHQjICusQtwIIKDAC&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3D4QKFpgOU3lw&usg=AFQjCNEUCszodjkCbv8gxQIdHxCPL1zY6A&sig2=ChIW25-BdE24EZQa34yyRQ\">Bodega Bamz</a>'s <em>Sidewalk Exec</em> project, I produced the whole thing; I'm trying to do some more work like that.\n\n<strong>Who are some of your favorite artists you worked with thus far.</strong>\n\nI like working with Bodega Bam. We click together. Dave East, he works fast. Really, like all the artists on The Opiate, I have good chemistry with. That’s why I chose them to be on my project.\n\n<strong>What are some of your goals as a producer? So do you see yourself maybe getting into like film or other avenues at all?</strong>\n\nI would love to; I would love to get into film because I'm a big movie head. I know every classic film, I got every movie. So definitely like ultimate goal would be to score a movie. And as far as being a producer, yeah, I would like to be mentioned with the greats, the great hip-hop producers, I want my name on that list, you know?\n\n<strong>Here’s the hard question. Who would be your top producers?</strong>\n\nTop 5?\n\n<strong>That’s hard as hell, I know.</strong>\n\nIt is. I would have to say, Alchemist, Dr. Dre, Timbaland, Pharell…\n\n<strong>If you notice, a lot of the producers you mentioned are producers that did film scoring – and did mad other shit. They went to a whole other level. Like Alchemist with Gangrene, you know, doing the score for <i>GTA</i>.</strong>\n\nOh yeah, and Pharell is a genius. He’s like the new Quincy Jones; he’s going to be around forever. Would want to take it there, you know.\n\n<strong>So what else do you have coming?</strong>\n\nI have some videos coming up from The Opiate, top of the year.\n\n<strong>What tracks do you have videos for?</strong>\n\nRight now, the Dark Lo track, The Message. Honestly, I'm trying to shoot everything off the project, so you want to look out for new videos. I also have new drum kits coming out, new sounds. Just be on the lookout for upcoming projects man.\n\n<strong>You know, before I learned about you, I'd heard some of your stuff before, but just didn’t realize it was you.</strong>\n\nThat’s basically what I'm trying to do right now, let people know who I am. People probably heard my stuff, but they didn’t know I did it.\n\n<strong>It’s hard; that’s the hard part about being a producer.</strong>\n\nThe producer is stuck in a cut – behind the scenes.\n\n<strong>Yeah, you got to look for it; you've got to know to look for it. Like Dre, you just know Dre did it. If you're making a Dre track, you make a point of telling everybody it’s a Dre track. Artists don’t do that for just anyone.</strong>\n\nYeah, he broke so many artists. He started a lot of things; a lot of times you need to work with an artist that’s going to push your name like that. A lot of these new artists, they get what they get from you, and they keep on pushing rather than trying to build. Metro Boomin', he got a bunch of people—he got fire, but he also got a bunch of people pushing him too.\n\n<strong>Absolutely. As a producer you've got to have the foresight to kind of say, \"I think these people are going to make incredible, amazing shit.\" Like Metro Boomin' is in a good place because a lot of artists he worked with just exploded. Like 40's in a great place because Drake just went bonkers, you know what I mean?</strong>\n\nExactly. Like me, I'm a little bit all over the place because I work with so many different artists, but I think that’s going to push me forward. When I came in the game, I was doing a lot of stuff for Vado. I did a majority of his first couple of mixtapes. But then, I don’t know, we just went our ways.\n\n<strong>You never know.</strong>\n\nI'm not mad at him, just you know…\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLiqZSp303Q\n\n<strong>You just got to have foresight. That’s what it is. All <i>The Opiate</i> artists, you just click with. But, you’ll do tracks with some people, and they’ll be aight, but it just won’t click.</strong>\n\nYeah, sometimes you just got to find that right… like you said, foresight man; but, sometimes you can have the wrong foresight.\n\n<strong>It's also work ethic.</strong>\n\nAnd, the game is just different now. Shit’s different. You'll be cool one day – and then it switches up the next. That’s why I choose to work with various artists too because I don’t want to be stuck working with an artist that just ups and leaves. I don’t want to be looking at the wall like \"This nigga shitted on me.\" Shit’s crazy, man.\n\n<strong>That happens. Look at Guru, before he died, everything he put out was done by Solaar. He dumped Premo...who dumps Premo?</strong>\n\nHe shitted on him man. That’s how you know shit wasn’t right. Even other artists shitted on him; Jay-Z, he just stopped working with him out of nowhere, onto the new.\n\n<strong>That’s the progression of hip-hop, too.</strong>\n\nPremo doesn’t change; I mean, once you're legendary, you're going to be legendary regardless. But, you've got to switch it up. I don’t want to be stuck in that shit with my beats sounding like dinosaurs.\n\n<strong>Well, it’s a different day. Things come in cycles. If you're a producer that was stuck on 90s shit – and you just didn’t leave that vibe – this is a good time for you right now, you know what I mean?</strong>\n\nI got a little bit of the old stuff in my beats mixed in with the new things. I can do trap drums and shit like that, blend it in…I'm just trying to do whatever sounds good to me. Got to stay relevant.\n\n<strong>Absolutely. You got to stay relevant and just be like 5 percent innovative. You've just go to be different enough; you know what I mean? So you don’t get bogged down. If you're a creative soul, making the same thing all the time will kill you after a while.</strong>\n\nIt gets boring. You got to add more to it. Sometimes you might need a break so that you can come back hard. It’s all about who raps on your shit. It all goes back to that again. What’s the Pusha joint called? <i>Untouchable</i>. Like alright, to me, the beat is fire, but you need a rapper on it. Not just anyone could kill that beat.\n\n<strong>Yeah, that whole album was on fire – incredible.</strong>\n\nYeah, I'm glad somebody did it, man, because rap is terrible right now.\n\n<strong>Exactly!</strong>\n\nI'm glad somebody did it. Someone on that level… yeah. I think that’s regular fire to me. His album, a lot of people are supposed to be doing that. That’s what people are supposed to be doing, but rap changed. It’s not even all the way rap now, it’s just a bunch of genres just blended, you know what I mean?\n\n<strong>Absolutely.</strong>\n\nAs far as a rap album, that’s an excellent album.\n\n<strong>That’s the best album I’ve heard in a long time. He’s just straight up bars.</strong>\n\nYeah, people think you can't rap anymore. You can rap, but you just got make it sound good. Pusha T makes it look good. He's got good videos, he’s fresh, he’s talking about real topics. You just got to make it look appealing. I like the Schoolboy Q's album too that shit was pretty dope.\n\n<strong>I liked that as well. TDE in general.</strong>\n\nThey're like the new people that’s running rap, man. That’s what New York is supposed to be sounding like, TDE shit; but, nobody wants to say that, nobody wants to admit that. People want to do shit the same old way they were doing it, but that’s not going to work, anymore.\n\n<iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/users/15390692&color=ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false\" width=\"100%\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"no\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe>",

    "content_html": "<blockquote>\n<p class=\"p1\">\"It’s the wavelengths, bro, that change over time because nothing stops moving -- including people. Niggas get older; new people take their place.\"</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">-- Kidaf</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p class=\"p1\">The next generation of hip-hop is coming of age as of late, and the future of the genre is bright. Not to say there wasn't always youngins in the game, but the industry is a transitional state, and a new breed of artists armed with a true sense of golden era asthetic – and a built in digital marketing compass – are reclaiming the elements that had many of us older heads fall in love with the back in it's hay day. Furthermore, these new rappers are seemingly a buffer, allowing some of the older/jaded ears to take in some of the newer influences they may otherwise sleep on. There are a number of soldiers leading this brigade, many of whom I've featured here. Today, though, I want to introduce Loaf Muzik, a Brooklyn hip-hop collective consisting of members Oso Dope, Kidaf, Shine Sinatra, and Shadow The Great.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">All in their early 20's, these cats are remarkably self-aware, and seem to have found their artistic focus/foundation quite early on. With their new mixtape, <i>Live From The Dungeon</i>, their collaborative release with Harry Freud, <i>Camo Assassin</i>, and their work with Team Backpack, their work ethic is showing – and for now, it's all in-house.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The guys were kind enough to sit down with AAHIPHOP to talk about their music, their influences and more. Check out the interview below, and get familiar!</p>\n\n<center>\n<img src=\"http://aboveaveragehiphop.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/IMG_2721.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"22%\" /><img src=\"http://aboveaveragehiphop.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/IMG_2720.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"22%\" /><img src=\"http://aboveaveragehiphop.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/IMG_2719.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"22%\" /><img src=\"http://aboveaveragehiphop.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/IMG_2718.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"22%\" /></center>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>(L--R: Shadow The Great, Oso Dope, Kidaf, Shine Sinatra)</em></p></center>\n\n\n<hr />\n\n<strong><span class=\"s1\">Talk a little bit about first how you got into hip-hop and then we’ll get into Loaf Muzik and how that came together...</span></strong>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><strong>OSO</strong>: I got into hip hop pretty much just opening up my eyes to my surroundings and my neighborhood where I was growing up. You know, here in people’s apartments and across the street somebody else had they speaker outside their 7th-floor apartment; hearing people compete for the loudest speaker, facing the window, hearing that soul. That bass line, those drums, at the park, on every single corner. That’s where my hip-hop experience began, literally just growing up taking a detour around the neighborhood and stuff like that. Also, video games that had mad brand new tracks on them. I would play the games just to listen and bump the tracks, every word, things like that. That’s how I started knowing about different MCs.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><strong>Shine</strong>: In all truth, it was Shadow, he exposed me to it. He showed me everything about it. Whether it was the lyricism or DJing or, you know, b-boying, I just started to expand my knowledge about it. It just caught my attention; you know what I mean? I got put onto like all these artists and at the time, I was like maybe 14 or 15. Listening to dudes that grew up in the same city I grew up in. Relating to them in a certain type of way because of what they're saying. Listening in to them, also to the drums, the bass line, the low end. It was just like, so captivating. You got all these dope ass lyricists who come from the same area in reality. You got Big Pun from Queens, Biggie from Brooklyn and all these dope ass artists – but they're all New York artists. It was like, knowing that all these guys grew up in the same city that I'm growing up in—it was crazy. Being 14, knowing that. It was dope.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><strong>Kidaf</strong>: How I fell in love with hip-hop? It’s a very particular story, bro. My brother had just turned 18; he copped a fucking Lincoln LS, some burgundy shit. I went inside, and he was playing a Big L and Jay-Z freestyle. It was a 9-minute long freestyle. I heard hip hop before but I had never heard nobody kill it like that. Ever since I heard that, I just fell in love with the art. And then with the art comesthe culture. You just feel all these people just doing what they want to do in a world where that’s pretty hard, you know what I'm saying? It was attractive to me, even as a young kid. Now that I’m older, I still have that same mind state – do it yourself. In 2016 everybody got their movement.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong><span class=\"s1\">So how did you guys come together? Did you guys go to the same school? How did you guys meet and decide to form Loaf Muzik?</span></strong></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><strong>Kidaf</strong>: Through music and school, bro. Education is secondary to it, though. I knew Shadow in middle school; he was living in Brooklyn. It was like a community thing. I was living all the way in Queens. I was fucking with his shit, he was fucking with mine, and then we linked up – and we started making music together. It sounds pretty straightforward, but it was dope the way everything came together.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><strong>OSO</strong>: The simplest form of it was pretty much… I knew Shine from the neighborhood, and I also knew Shadow from the neighborhood. It was like \"I’m going to rep your shit, you're going to rep my shit,\" that’s how we started with the music aspect. We just started hanging out more, and it became a lifestyle – more of a religion. We had started making plans and started evolving more of our homies/crew into what it is now.</span></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p class=\"p1\">\"If people say New York hip hop is back, then New York hip hop is back. The people are the ones that create these terms...\"</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">-- Oso Dope</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong><span class=\"s1\">Is it more of a group or collective? Because it’s very specific wording. For example, Wu-Tang is a group. I guess they’ve grown into a collective, but they're a group. Do you guys think about yourselves as separate entities or do you work more as a group?</span></strong></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><strong>Kidaf</strong>: Nah, I think it’s like this bro: If we’re all in the same room, it’s a group. But the minute I step outside that door, it’s all me. We’re all in our shit, and we all have our style you know what I'm saying? That’s why the group is so strong. I think we’re kind of both, man. I think once you start to use words like the group and collective...I mean, we’re brothers; I'm probably going to chill with them later on today, and smoke—you know what I'm saying? We’re a family...we’re a family first.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><strong>Shine</strong>: It’s like collective creatively. The group is like the family. We mob together. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><strong>OSO</strong>: Everyone has their shit, yeah.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><strong>Kidaf</strong>: Exactly, everyone has their creative niche that just coexists with everyone else. That’s the collective part of it. One vibration.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong><span class=\"s1\">It’s an interesting direction too because if you think about it, collectives don’t break up. Groups break up. Groups always have trouble, but collectives don’t break up because it’s a different mentality. Native tongues is a collective; they're all very strong artists kind of on their own. </span></strong></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong><span class=\"s1\">What are you guys currently working on?</span></strong></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">We just dropped a tape called <i><a href=\"https://www.google.ca/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0ahUKEwjS5KzZxZXKAhXD8x4KHWYXALEQFggcMAA&url=https%3A%2F%2Floafmuzik.bandcamp.com%2Freleases&usg=AFQjCNFcWwneCmBORiOkOBzU1UHsydotUg&sig2=CsUwHChaeSrFIoM6HUBuOw\">Live from the Dungeon</a> </i>that can be found on DatPiff.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><strong>OSO</strong>: We also dropped <i>Camo Assassin </i>like a week or two ago. That’s the shit that we just did; we were in the studio for 22 hours with Harry Freud, we came out with that. It came out through Red Bull Sound Selects. They (Red Bull) put us up on Pandora, too. We’re going to keep creating keep giving you guys a taste of Loaf, you know what I'm saying. Just more and more.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><strong>Kidaf</strong>: A lot of things, a lot of projects following up. That’s what people can expect. More <em>Live From The Dungeon</em>, more of that experience, more of that insight. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/233489655&color=ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false\" width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" frameborder=\"no\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong><span class=\"s1\">Here’s a question: You guys do a lot independently. Do you guys think about maybe going with a label or going major? Do you think there’s an advantage?</span></strong></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><strong>Kidaf</strong>: Loaf Muzik, it’s a label already. That’s how we operate. Always had a do-it-yourself mentality. When we were all getting together, trying to figure out how we were going to get this shit bigger, it was never like, how are we going to get found? It was more like, how are we going to create a foundation of sand, that way we can keep getting bigger to fill more places? We don’t have a handout mentality. Not to say that anybody getting signed to a label is getting a handout, but in-house is our specialty, and we take a lot of pride in that. Getting shit done on our own, and not working <em>for</em> somebody but working <em>with</em> somebody.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong><span class=\"s1\">Who are some of the artists that you guys look up to?</span></strong></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><strong>OSO</strong>: On the real, I look up to Daf.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><strong>Kidaf</strong>: Yeah, to keep it real with you bro, to keep it real, I listen to a lot of rap. Regarding artists I look up to, I look up to these guys bro. Not even be corny with it. I know these people. It’s hard for me to sit down and create a character for an artist that I look up to, and want to be like. Hip-hop is what we do; you know what I'm saying? I'm more inspired by the people around me, how they get down. The last thing you want to do is be the wack nigga while your homies are killing it. </span><span class=\"s1\">So yeah, that’s my answer to that bro.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong><span class=\"s1\">You guys do have a very 90s sound. I'm much older than you guys. I'm about 10, 12 years older than you guys. You guys sound like the shit I was bumping in high school, which is dope. It’s very organic; it doesn’t seem like you're trying to sound like that.</span></strong></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><strong>Kidaf</strong>: People say shit like that all the time, bro. Ever since we started, people have been saying that. I don’t think that's what we’re going for; I think we’re just going for lyricism. That’s how it is in my head. Everybody else is filtered; it will go straight to old school hip hop. We spit, we do what we like, you know what I'm saying? Of course, to a lot of people, it’s going to translate into that. That’s just the way life is. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><strong>OSO</strong>: I think it’s a compliment, having them compare us. Not compare us, but tell us that we remind them of something that is great. I feel like the music from the 90s is great music, it hits home. That’s the root of a lot of people’s hip hop introduction. To be able to remind people much older than us, it’s a compliment. Yo, I remind you of a great time? That’s what’s up! We remind you of great music? Thank you, it’s an honor.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><strong>Shine</strong>: Whenever people say that it’s a compliment. To me, music from the 90s is very much timeless. So when people say we remind them of that sound, It’s like saying we have a timeless sound. That’s very much what music should be; music should be timeless.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">http://youtu.be/v3cfFMMLO2o</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong><span class=\"s1\">People seem to be the most connected to a certain period of music in their lives, you know what I'm saying. It’s like in the Tribe song, was it <i>Excursions</i>? When Q-Tip’s dad was saying that hip hop reminded him of bebop. That’s what he listened to when he was a kid. </span></strong></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><strong>OSO</strong>: That shit was dope, bebop, it’s a compliment. I feel like every music has a  root, it comes from somewhere. I feel like the further you go back in music, the greater it makes you feel based on the vibrations. To remind someone of those good vibrations is a good feeling because that’s what we want to do. We want to transcend good vibrations and positivity when we do our art, do our lyricism, do our beats, do our visuals, do our shows, do all that. </span></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p class=\"p1\">\"To me, music from the 90s is very much timeless. So when people say we remind them of that sound, It’s like saying we have a timeless sound.\"</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">-- Shine Sinatra</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong><span class=\"s1\">How important is it for you guys to stay true to where you're from as New York cats? Because when I listen to you guys, it sounds like a resurgence of New York hip hop. It sounds like New York is coming back. Hip-hop went through many stages, and it went through damn near every region in the United States of America in the last 20 years. </span></strong></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><strong>Shine</strong>: If people say New York hip hop, is back then I guess they should say \"hip hop\" is back – and that’s dope. In a conventional sense, it’s back, but it never left. It’s in the streets. It’s a lifestyle, and you just don’t drop a lifestyle. As long as people who live that lifestyle are still breathing, then it’s still alive. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong><span class=\"s1\">I feel like maybe eight years ago you guys would’ve been as buzzing. The sound was very, very different.</span></strong></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><strong>Shine</strong>: People are always going just to try to put things in categories…</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><strong>Kidaf</strong>: One style can make other styles obsolete if enough people fuck with it. Think about it. It’s like alright cool, somebody is rapping about diamonds, and mad niggas is fucking with diamonds. But then, some nigga comes out of nowhere from the gutter in the Bronx, or some shit, and says, \"we don’t give a fuck about nothing, and the niggas are on the fucking street.\" It'll be like, fuck diamonds bro, we’re hitting the streets, this shit is hot now. It’s not even about the style. It’s the wavelengths, bro, that changes over time because nothing stops moving including people. Niggas get older; new people take their place. New shit.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><strong>OSO</strong>: If people say New York hip hop is back, then New York hip hop is back. The people are the ones that create these terms and like Daf said, these wavelengths. They're like the critics; they're the perspective. So it’s like, they receive what we create. So whatever they see is how they feel about it. That's technically how it goes, you know. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong><span class=\"s1\">Where do you guys see Loaf Muzik going? What’s your ultimate goal? It might be a hard question. What’s your goal? What do you guys want to be 30 years from now when people are looking back? What do you want people to remember about Loaf Muzik?</span></strong></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><strong>Kidaf</strong>: Our creations – everything we expose as artists. We want to be remembered as what we do, what we create, what we put out. It's just crazy because we all have mad shit, mad goals, and when we come together, it just multiplies. I just want to Influence others, really, just to continue to vibrate on this frequency with us, to spread positivity.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><strong>Shine</strong>: Maybe some nigga that we don’t even know, from some other part of the world somewhere is going to get up and change his whole life just because he heard a track and got inspired. That is contagious.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><strong>OSO</strong>: No more of that hating, people. It's about unity. It’s real; that’s what it comes down to. That’s where hip-hop started, people coming together. I feel like we have the platforms to make it happen, so that’s what we gon’ do.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><strong>Shine</strong>: Make some dope ass music, travel the world and shit.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><strong>Kidaf</strong>: Yeah, pretty much.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong><span class=\"s1\">You guys have any last words, any last shout outs? </span></strong></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><strong>OSO</strong>: Thanks for the interview man.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><strong>Kidaf</strong>: Shout out to AboveAverageHipHop.com, thanks for having us, yo. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><strong>Shine</strong>: You should check out Camo Assasins when you get the chance. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><strong>Kidaf</strong>: You know what I'm saying, high new hip hop! Shout out to my man, shout out to Captain Mark… mad dope visuals, new films, just stay in the fucking loop with us. Keep out, keep watch, Brooklyn, Queens, all that shit universal. </span></p>\nhttps://youtu.be/bZB1NS4JnsY\n\nhttps://youtu.be/nauo3hNMtuw\n\nhttps://youtu.be/zg0qexTWpqo",

    "content_html": "<blockquote>I was gifted with a voice, but I have a rapper mentality.\n--Tim Vocals</blockquote>\nThere has always been a fair share of R&B \"bad boys,\" for lack of a better term. By that, I mean singers who, well, have more of an edge to them than other singers. I'm not talking about Chris Brown-esque antics either, I'm talking singers like Aaron Hall for example, or (probably a better example) The late Nate Dogg, who crooned about the ghetto lifestyle, and had an unmistakable aura of authenticity that made him a star (even if he did lack actual battle scars). I recently came across a new singer by the name of Tim Vocals when perusing WorldStar, and was an instant fan. Over the infamous White Iverson instrumental, Tim initially came off – content wise – like Uncle Murda, mixed with a more soulful/hungry Usher. Dope right?\n\nI explored his catalogue of music, including his <a href=\"https://www.google.ca/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0ahUKEwiGuoz0v6zKAhWB1x4KHY6UBNcQFggcMAA&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.livemixtapes.com%2Fmixtapes%2F18555%2Ftim_vocals_live_from_harlem.html&usg=AFQjCNEX4UyrV1xsxQ6Piph7NhleTb6WZA&sig2=FlPtPE_7_hOOVhi0LcfjlA\">Live From Harlem</a> mixtape, and found more than a handful of gems, like the bassy drug dealer anthem, <em>Harlem NYC</em>, and numerous \"goon remixes,\" like his recent take on Weeknd's The Hills, titled The Pills. Tim came up on the mean streets of Harlem, and went through his share of real-life experiences, spending some years in and out of jail before putting the streets into the rear view, and hitting the ground running in the industry. You can hear this authenticity in his music, which adds to his brand and makes his voice so relatable throughout neighbourhoods nationwide. To fully understand what I mean, just watch some of his early vids where he's singing in building lobby's back on the block; he lived that life.\n\nHis team is solid, and he's working with the likes of Harry Fraud, Nino Man, Smoke DZA and more, so evidently Tim is on a serious come-up – and someone you should keep an eye/ear on. Tim was kind enough to hop on a call with me to chat about his new album, <em>R.N.B</em>, which is available now, and more. Check the Q&A below. Be sure to grab Tim's <a href=\"https://www.google.ca/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=3&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0ahUKEwiUl5XGoazKAhUJJx4KHdIQBY8QFggoMAI&url=https%3A%2F%2Fitunes.apple.com%2Fus%2Falbum%2Fr.n.b%2Fid1041453972&usg=AFQjCNHNYXOVH8yhGP-0y9Om6ITfjDf4sg&sig2=DYG8eSbHKHw02JHH5yMhbw\"><em>R.N.B</em> album on I-Tunes</a> ASAP – or stream it on <a href=\"https://play.spotify.com/album/7Dy6Ve0VRIMqXzQOl8ioqp?play=true&utm_source=open.spotify.com&utm_medium=open\">Spotify</a>.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jl10vlLyMj8\n\n<hr />\n\n<strong>How did you get into music?</strong>\n\nOh man, that’s a good question. I got into music listening to my older sisters and brothers play music in the house all the time – and certain things stuck more than others. I was always into rap but when I heard R&B, it became something I had to get into. So I got my first tape player and headphones, and then I just started emulating what I heard. Bam, here I am today.\n\n<strong>How big of an influence is hip-hop on your R&B? Because you’re R&B but its more street…</strong>\n\nYeah, I was gifted with a voice, but I have a rapper mentality. I think what’s influenced me as far as R&B, are singers like Jodeci, Chris Brown, Usher, Donell Jones , but the rap -- I grew up listening to LL. Going back to the old school, Kool G Rap, Big Daddy Kane; I listened to a whole lot of rap music to hear what’s going on. That’s how I fell in love with rap and music period. But, I don’t think I have a genre. I don’t think that anything that I’m doing right now has a set stage. I just love music right now. I’m making music that makes me feel good. As far as my <em>R.N.B</em> album, I was going through things in my life at the time – and I just wrote about it. That’s basically what it is right now. I’m loving music again.\n\n<strong>Tell me a little bit about your current project, who you are working with and the process of putting it together.</strong>\n\nI’m working with a label called Next; it’s an independent label. The Orchard is pushing it out – I’m pretty sure everybody knows what Orchard is. My feature artists, well, there’s a couple of people, like Smoke DZA, my son Dash… I’ve worked with a lot of people to get here. It was a smooth process. I’ve got another project in mind that is going to be real heavy; I just wanted to get this out there and get my feet wet.\n\n<strong><img class=\"alignleft  wp-image-3480\" src=\"http://aboveaveragehiphop.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/tim2-1.png\" alt=\"tim2\" width=\"313\" height=\"455\" />Alright, so who are some people that you’d like to work with in the industry?</strong>\n\nNumber one would be like Drake, Miguel -- I’d like to work with Bryson Tiller right now, too. I’d like to work with a lot of people.\n\n<strong>How important is authenticity in your music?</strong>\n\nI think that the more I see, the more I feel, and the more I write while things are fresh – at the time – the better the music (depending on what mode I’m in). If I’m in a deep mode at the time, I can write about anything. But, those feelings at the time, that energy, that's what I’m going to give off. If I’m around good vibes, the music is going to show it. If I’m around bad things, it’s going to reflect too.\n\n<strong>What are you currently working on right now?</strong>\n\nI’ve got something in the works with Harry Fraud; we’re doing a little EP you know what I’m saying? That wasn’t supposed to be told, but I said it anyway -- you know me. I also have another album I’m working on – but that one is something I’m going to do with other people. I’ve got a couple of things you know what I’m saying?\n\n<strong>So, you write for other people as well?</strong>\n\nYes, I do. But the other people I write for are underground artists.\n\n<strong>Do you find that to be a therapeutic process? Are they all similar artists to you?</strong>\n\nYou know, I go into it unbiased to everything. I just write. I think of it as a therapeutic process at the same time, but I just love music from the beat, to the writing, to the actual singing – and references or whatever it is. I love it.\n\n<strong>Do you have any new visuals coming up?</strong>\n\nYes, I have a video coming out; the third single off my album called <em>Things You Do For Love</em>. That’s going to be pretty dope.\n\n<strong>That <em>Black Washington</em> joint was the catchiest shit ever. You need to know that!</strong>\n\nI appreciate that. I don’t even pay attention to stuff like that when I’m around friends. I’ll just be listening to everybody else. I don’t even listen to myself much. I listen to everybody else.\n\n<strong>Yeah, it’s weird; some people are the complete opposite. I talk to some artists that say, “I only listen to my music,” like Wayne. I think it was in an interview someone asked him what he thought of the new Nicki album (when Nicki and Drake first dropped their albums), and he admitted that he didn’t listen to the album all the way through. He’d ever heard them because he only listens to his own shit 24/7.</strong>\n\nThat’s dope for him. It’s crazy for a Libra because I’m a Libra too, we usually show the love. But I don’t know. I’m always listening to somebody else. I like to hear new sounds and new people with their ideas and how they want to express it through music. I’m always for that.\n\n<strong>Do you have any other artists in your crew that you’re working with? Is it just you as Tim Vocals or is there a team we should be looking out for?</strong>\n\nI got a team in mind, but I don’t think I’m going to present them just yet because everything is in the works. But, I’ve got a person I’ve been working with. We’re about to go back and do what we’ve got to do. We’re about to make that shit happen again.\n\n<strong>Tim, do you have any last words or anything else you’d like to leave our blog with?</strong>\n\nYo, just be on the look out for some fire, man. I appreciate anybody and any blogger or anybody that wants to interview me. I think that what I’ve got to say is very important. Yeah, as he said, honestly, I appreciate everybody that wants to know my story and what’s going on with me.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGYxy1dwVOU\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rpNLr9yxHS0\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8oemMd4hbk",

    "content_html": "<blockquote>No matter what it is you decide to do you have two options; give it 0% or give it 100% – there is no in between.\n–Winston Anthony</blockquote>\nIt never ceases to amaze me how connected the world has become, and how worldwide hip-hop truly is. An example was last week, when I came across an up and coming rapper named Winston Anthony, who submitted his latest video <em>All Night</em> via our submission page. It wasn't until I explored his bio that I realized that Winston was from New Zealand – of all places. In fact, our peers over at undergroundhiohopblog.com have dubbed him on of the most prominent artists from the country. That co-sign alone told me that I was missing out on something; a problem I quickly corrected.\n\nWinston has a great visual presentation, a good catalogue of tunes, and more than enough plays – and buzz – to pique the interest of the average hype beast. We wanted to learn a little more about him, so we reached out for a Q&A to get more familiar with his process, his goals and his upcoming projects.\n\nhttp://youtu.be/R9HOwgw6Ew8\n\n<hr />\n\n<strong>How did you get into hip-hop?</strong>\n\nI got in to Hip Hop when I was about 16, I met this kid I was in high school with who was in a rap group with his little brother and another one of our homies. He asked me to join and back then I was way too timid so I offered to make beats and write hooks. I never turned back after that.\n\n<strong>Who were some of your influences?</strong>\n\nI low key hate this question [laughs]; but only because I was raised on R&B as opposed to Hip Hop. So, my answer is never the regular Pac, Biggie, Nas etc. I mean, don't get me wrong, I do love the greats and always pay my respects. But my personal influences were more along the lines of Michael Jackson, Jay-Z, Kanye West, Timberland, T.I. & Eminem.\n\n<strong>Being from New Zealand must give you a must different perspective on today's music industry. Maybe talk about the scene out there.</strong>\n\nYeah, I mean the scene from New Zealand is a special scene I think. It's a country where people aren't afraid to try things you know? It's been interesting for someone like myself though who was raised on quite an American style of music to watch the New Zealand sound grow and evolve organically and, of course, being a part of the industry watching artists who I know define that sound. I would say if you wanted to ever really listen to some Hip Hop that emulated New Zealand's sound, look up these three names to give you a broad view of where the country is at: Home Brew Crew, Raiza Biza & Diaz Grimm.\n\n<strong>Talk about <em>Side Chick</em>, and some of the response you received internationally.</strong>\n\n<em>Side Chick</em> was an interesting project to work on. I wanted to do something that other rappers hadn't done but also I love concept projects, so it needed that aspect. Then I came up with the idea of doing a project predominantly for women with the twist that it was actually about a bunch of side chicks. To be honest, it did better than I was expecting it to do, I was blessed enough to have the support of my fam out in L.A. (undergroundhiphopblog.com) with the drop and it sort of just grew from there. ixDaily from Canada jumped on board, AyeBro from New Zealand showed love, OZHipHop from out here in Australia supported, and it even made a best of 2015 list on Audiocamp. Admittedly it was a project where I let people know that I grew up on R&B. Like, I wasn't trying to be hard, gangster or anything I'm not really and I think that's why people took to it. At least for my fan base, it was something you could relate to. My female fan base related to it the most. I mean, I guess this is the generation of side chicks and side n***as.\n\n<strong>What are you currently working on?</strong>\n\nI am currently working on the follow-up project to <em>Side Chick</em>. But this one is called <em>Main Chick</em>, I don't really want to say too much about it at this stage other than that it sounds stupid good and that I'm going to need everyone to be patient with this one, because I have a couple of things planned for it which I hope can be mad game changers, at least for myself – and anyone else in my lane. Also that I believe that a musicians work should reflect his/her personal growth and this project does exactly that. I mean other than waiting for that, expect a couple of singles here and there to tide you over until the big drop.\n\n<strong>What are your long term goals with your music?</strong>\n\nMy biggest long term goal is to find my place in the Hip Hop world, which I realise can be hard in such a saturated culture. But one of my producers said something cool to me the other day, he goes \"Winston, you're like that sportsman who has trained 100,000 hours already. You know what to do, and you're ready to play, but you're just waiting to figure out how you fit in the team.\" Admittedly I still have a lot to learn, as we all do. But I do believe he was predominantly right. At this point, if my team and I can keep doing what we do, its only a matter of time.\n\n<strong>Are you looking for a deal, or are you going to do it independently?</strong>\n\nAt this point I am focused on doing it independently. I was never raised to wait on anything or expect hand outs and one thing I learn't, while I was in L.A. was that there are a million artists out there. Labels don't really care who you are unless they can see you putting in work. So focusing on the independent grind seems like the only logical move you know?\n\n<strong>What do you want people to take away from you as an artist?</strong>\n\nWinning is Necessary. No matter what it is you decide to do you have two options; give it 0% or give it 100% there is no in between. That's something that one of my mentors taught me a few years back and since then, my team and I have gone on to do a list of things that we were never supposed to be able to do. Other than that, don't fit societies mold. I mean, I am a rapper who nearly has a law degree and is predominantly known for a project filled with songs for women; and I'm still making best of (Insert year) lists. Do you and do it well.\n\n<strong>Do you have any last words for our readers?</strong>\n\nIf you made it this far, thank you, you're pretty awesome haha. If you have been supporting since day one, thank you and I have nothing but the utmost love and respect for you.\n\n<hr />\n\n \n\nWebsite: <a href=\"http://winningisnecessary.com/\">http://winningisnecessary.com/</a>\nFacebook: <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/WinstonAnthonyMusic\">https://www.facebook.com/WinstonAnthonyMusic</a>\nTwitter: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/winston_anthony/\">https://twitter.com/winston_anthony/</a>\nInstagram: <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/wnnrs_szn/\">https://www.instagram.com/wnnrs_szn/</a>\nYoutube: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/WinstonAnthonyTV\">https://www.youtube.com/user/WinstonAnthonyTV</a>\nSoundcloud: <a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/winstonanthony\">https://soundcloud.com/winstonanthony</a>",

The region's mixture of realities that range from carefree beachfront living, plastic Hollywood dreaming, and circles of gang violence, LA has given us a broad variety of artists from all genres and mediums. Just Matthew is one such artist to emerge from the golden glow of Cali. At just 24 years of age, this rapper, singer and songwriter has developed a strong, confident style and sound that has him primed to take things to the next level.\n\nJust Matthew's latest project, the four-song EP <i>Connery</i>, is an excellent example of his range and capabilities as an artist. The lead song, <i>Forget</i>, has a laid back summery vibe that matches the Cali weather. With an almost Drake-esque (in a good way) flow, he bobs and weaves from singing to rapping, delivering a radio-ready performance that leaves a great first impression. <i>Prototype</i> sees him dig deeper beneath the surface as he embraces imperfections, and lets listeners know that he is indeed a work in progress – and his hunger to grow is the raw element that fuels his sound. <i>Understand It</i>, and <i>Bonnie</i>, both have Matthew showing off his flow, which sparkles throughout the EP. Produced entirely by MKSB, the project sounds cohesive sonically, while still managing to deliver four songs that allow Matthew to show four different sides of himself.\n\nJust Matthew's music is very current, catchy honest and personal. He's an artist to keep your eyes and ears on this year. Listen to his four-track EP below.\n\nhttp://youtu.be/0qMTg6qz26Y\n\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"450\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/playlists/137668375&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true\"></iframe>",

After the success of his debut mixtape, <i>The Instrumental Assassin </i>– hosted by DJ WhiteOwl – Phoenix moved to Phoenix, AZ, to work on his EP '<i>Valley of The Sun</i>' produced by Pezey Krack. During 2015 Phoenix produced, wrote, & starred as the main character in his very own short film Valley of The Sun, which sold out at Harkins Theatre (Arizona Mills) & also had huge success debuting in his hometown December 10th. December 19th Phoenix released his latest mixtape <i>Indigo: A New Generation</i>, a strong ten-song project that explores everything from police brutality, injustice, lost love and all the real-life stuff that falls in between. It's a wonderful introduction for first-time listeners – and a welcome addition to his catalogue for long-time supports.\n\nFrom the start of the album, Phoenix establishes the tone with a collection of sound it's from news broadcasts recounting the deaths of iconic artists such as 2Pac, Biggie, Aaliyah, and Jimmi Hendrix. He also includes a collection of news clips discussing the deaths of black youth across the United States. It's this off the top way he's aligning himself with legends that some may find egotistical – something he discusses on <i>Nodus Tollens,</i> which shows off his laid-back flow. Highlights of this album include the <i>Child (All I Ever Wanted)</i>, which discusses the concept of an inferiority complex, <i>S.A.M</i>, a letter to women who cheated on him, and <i>Wabi-Sabi</i>, which received a sexy video treatment.\n\nThe project also includes features from Young Money rapper Cory Gunz, on the remix to the song <i>VGV</i> – the second last song on the album. He claims his ultimate dream is to sign to J. Cole's Dreamville label or RocNation. With a project like Indigo, Phoenix shows promise. He's an artist to keep locked on, as it's only a matter of time! His film Valley of The Sun will be available this spring, but in the meantime, check out the official trailer.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO7vteeStGI\n\n<iframe src=\"http://www.audiomack.com/embed4-album/itsphoenix/indigo-a-new-generation\" width=\"100%\" height=\"350\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe>",

    "content_html": "Sometimes I feel as though I don't put on for my city enough – well, I'm going to work on ending that. I wanted to introduce you all to Capeech Cappucino, a talented brother hailing from Toronto. A devout student of hip-hop, and an obvious comic book head, Capeech has been on our radar for a minute now, so it was great to finally sit down and chat with him. In the Q&A below, we talk about how he got involved in the game, his upcoming project, and more.\n\nGive him an ear, and check the interview.\n\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"450\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/users/1320874&color=ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false\"></iframe>\n\n<hr>\n\n<b>How long have you been making music?  </b>\n\nGoing for about ten years. It started as a hobby of mine; but, I've been doing it serious for about a decade now.\n\n<b>How did you originally get into hip-hop?  What made you make that change from just having it as a hobby to taking it seriously?  </b>\n\nYou know, things were going on in my life. One of my homeboys got popped, and when he died, I started looking around and thinking how many more of us are going to get popped. In the back of mind, I knew that I wanted to follow through and make music; so, I said let me go ahead and do that.\n\n<b>So what do you currently have out now? </b>\n\nI have a single I just put out, <i>6 UP</i>, which is a prelude to this new album I'm currently working on.\n\n<b>Let’s talk a little bit about that album. </b>\n\nRight now I'm calling it <i>Secret Wars</i>, you know what I mean? There is a lot of BS in the industry, and a lot of talented MC’s are overlooked. It's less about being passionate about the artform and more about who knows who. I am going to confront all the BS; I want to speak from the heart and show that if you represent the culture, you should be able to get over. And that is what I am going to do.\n\n<b>Where do you see your career going?</b>\n\nWell, I mean that's a real question. I think everything is building up. I've been getting some serious love for my projects on the CMJ charts and the Earshot charts know what I mean? My last two EP’s started in the top ten – and that was just me introducing myself. I think with this next album, I'm going to cut through and begin to build a name for myself. My music is being felt from all the way out in Paris, France, to San Diego, California. I just think at the end of the day if your music is good enough, no matter who else is out, I think that you'll make an impact.\n\n<b>I like that! So, how would you describe your music?</b>\n\nWell, with me Capeech Cappuccino, I'm from the boom bap era, but at the same time I don’t limit myself. Golden era hip-hop is always going to be in my heart, and I'm always going to feel it, but I'm the next generation of MC. I'm doing it for the love of the art form, the same way that Miles Davis and John Coltrain held it down for Jazz. The way Robert Nester Marley, Bob Marley, held down reggae, I'm saying the next foundation of artists is strictly pure, and speaking from the heart you know what I mean? I'm not in it to get rich. If the money comes, the money comes; but, first and foremost I'm seeing issues In the culture that bother me, and I think they should be addressed. I grew up in a neighborhood where selling crack was as fundamental as learning how to play basketball. Unfortunately, for a lot of my friends their consequences were not the best – so hopefully my music can point some young ones in the right direction.\n\n<b>I like that you're building an organic career, and putting the music first. For some artists, it is like completely the opposite; the money comes first. It's like they want the fame before they even put in the work.</b>\n\nI was always taught that you have got to put in the work first before you reap any of the benefits so I think that with my next album that I am going to drop in the New Year, I want to show the work I've been putting in. I've been building up to something and people have been waiting. My name is on the tip of their tongues, but their not quite getting to digest what I give them. So with this new album, I'm going to give them a full plate.\n\n<b>That’s a good look, and it's a harder way to do it. A more organic approach is slower, but when you do things that way you end up with the bonus of longevity.</b>\n\nI will give you an example. When Jill Scott's first album came out, it wasn’t on a big record label. Slowly but surely people started listening; she was on the tip of everybody's tongue like \"yo, this new girl Jill Scott is incredible.\" You know what I mean? The rest is history, right?\n\n<b>I mean, look at El de Sensei.  Like El’s out there working! He's dropping albums, touring, and selling artifacts gear. </b><b>El isn't a mainstream artist – if you don’t know Artifacts, you're probably not going to learn about them.  But he has been the game for like 20 years?</b>\n\nHe’s a vet; he’s a vet you know what I am saying?\n\n<b>He just makes good music, and he does not waver from it. People who like him, love him; and he's very personable like, like if you go to his show, you could probably go on stage and rap with him you know what I am saying?</b>\n\nIf you build that foundation slowly, they will ride with you forever yo. Like KRS said, I'd have a couple of hundred real heads by me, than one million fake ones behind me.\n\nTo be honest, with you one of the things I have been doing is expanding from the outside in. You dig what I am saying? The track that I just put up, “6 Up,” the reason I put it out was that a DJ from Ohio, DJ Quest, was like \"yo, Capeech we need some new music from you.\" I had no intention of putting anything out until the album was released, but I decided to get this off. Right now, a lot of the blogs are showing me a lot of love. You know what I mean like yours.\n\n<b>We have a cool position – and I know from making music down in Jersey and New York. Everybody thinks we have funky accents, and they're more open than ever to our music; however, we've [Toronto artists] been out there forever. Just the other day I was listening to some Stretch & Bibbito tapes my buddy digitalized. It's crazy, you go back to '95, and they were playing Thrust, Choclair, Saukrates...</b>\n\nI was in Florida, and then I went to New York, and then I came back home. What I found out is that there are so many artists in Toronto, but what happens is that they don’t get the initial reaction they thought they might have gotten, and eventually they burn out. So it’s like a marathon and what I have come to understand is that Canadians are tough people. I met lots of heads in the US they were all trying to hear me, see what I am saying?\n\n<b>It’s true.</b>\n\nSo I made it a point, I said to myself I am going to build from outside in as opposed to going from the inside out, and I have had much more success that way. I would love to get the respect and the love in my city, but you can’t beat a brick wall down with just your fists, so I decided to use my hammer – my hammer is my microphone – and I build from the outside in and then go from there.\n\n<b>And it's a good time for us, I mean, for example, look at somebody like <a href=\"https://youtu.be/Qty7b2jfmlU\">Frankenstein</a>; like, if he came out today his shit would pop so hard in New York City, I mean the time is right for that, everybody is tired of all the other shit.\n</b>\nNo doubt, timing is something that no one can predict, but when you're in the moment, you have got to make the most of it.\n\n<b>100%.</b>\n\nAt the end of the day, it will get you where you need to go, but you have got to put the work in.\n\n<b>That’s just it, and I mean there are cats out here that have put out like 33,000 mixtapes, and then poof, they disappear. </b>\n\nHow good is the music? That is the thing too.\n\n<b>Yeah, but it’s tough. It's very easy to make music these days; it’s not as it was back in the day. People had to work hard to get the music made; you know what I am saying?</b>\n\nI know what you are saying.\n\n<b>Anybody can make music now, I mean if you look hard you could probably find studios for as cheap as $50 a session.\n</b>\nIt's funny when I first started out, I was going around to different studios and so forth, and a lot of people have got the pro tools and the logics, and they were recording tracks and vocals, but truly when it comes to building the artists, they can't do that.\n\n<b>Yip.</b>\n\nYou know what I am saying? And I think for a lot of artists, a lot of times, are lacking those things with the music. They have got nobody in their corner saying you need to change that up, or you didn’t do that right. I can’t tell you how many times people come on the radio, and they sound like Drake.\n\n<b>People always say that the older artists don’t like to pass the torch. They don’t like to share and mentor and stuff, but they do man you know what I am saying? A lot of the lower profile OGs do. I also think if you took an artist to an analog studio, the way they think about making music would change.</b>\n\nYeah, that is a good point, I just saw an interview on that with a producer by the name of Louis Parker. My man was just saying he still records his stuff analog wise, and I was like wow that’s hot; I didn’t think anybody still did that, but that is hot.\n\n<b>Well Capeech, thanks for taking the to chat with me – and AAHIPHOP – today.</b>\n\nNo, thank you. I wish you guys all the best for 2016; I know you guys are going to have a great year!",

Some would say a sonic signature and an unmistakable style that helps shape cultural waves. Whenever the age old debate about producers gets started, names like Pete Rock and DJ Premier seem to swirl in the atmosphere as names that helped to shape hip-hop during it's golden era. Rarely, though, do heads fully give props to the green-eyed bandit, Erick Sermon.\nThe E of EPMD, Erick and Parish brought their brand of Rakim-ish high/low energy wordplay that took the game by storm. They moved units and released three studio albums before they broke hip-hop's heart and split ways – a move that helped to shape the career paths of both the Hit Squad, which counted Das Efx in its ranks, and the Def Squad, which consisted of Keith Murray and Redman. Their breakup had a few theories, including that Erick set up PMD to be robbed, and that there were shady money dealings. Regardless, they regrouped roughly three years later.\n\nAside from his work on the mic, Erick got just as busy on the boards. As a producer, Erick's sound has a distinctive blend of thick funk, deep chunky bass, and a tinge of electro synth. He probably has – in my opinion – one of the most underrated catalogues today. Below I've compiled some of my fave Erick Sermon Productions.\n\n<b><i>How High</i></b>\n\nhttp://youtu.be/08MBkTDTSuA\n\nI'd give a million dollars to be the A&R that had the \"aha\" moment the first time they heard Red & Meth together on wax. These two have had an illustrious career that has given an eternal pass, and a special place in the hearts of all real heads. If you trace their hip-hop lineage, though, all roads lead to <i>How High</i>, which I would argue stands as their most organic and brilliant piece of history. Now this was the 90's, so all songs had a video version, and then the version you heard when you got home and popped in the $14.00 CD you copped from Sam Goody. It was the video version, produced by Erick; that pushed this song over the top.\n\n<b><i>Hey Lover</i></b>\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PnMqk2rrwME\n\nAfter a roller coaster few years, with the critical bomb <i>14 Shots To The Dome</i>, and then his \"comeback\" – but don't call it that – <i>Mama Said Knock You Out</i>, LL Cool J returned with one of his best albums (in my opinion), <i>Mr. Smith</i>. It contained the hits <i>Doin It</i>, <i>I Shot Ya</i> and, of course, <i>Hey Lover</i>. The song featured Boyz II Men, which was the 1995 equivalent of having Jesus on your record. The boys were still popping off the success of their album II, aka the album with <i>I'll Make Love To You</i>. Unlike How High, Erick's connection was almost buried in history, as a  B-side remix. It's one of those songs you either across by mistake, or never really heard. Well, it's incredible – and has all the unmistakable elements of Erick in his heyday. Bump it for yourself.\n\n<b><i>Buy You Some</i></b>\n\nhttps://youtu.be/XS1rdo_ccEY\n\nIf you're under 30, you may get the gist of what Too Short is about, based on his recent music, which he gets a pass for; however, if you missed Too Short in his heyday, you missed the boat. He made independent rap money since the 80's, and quite literally went from selling tapes from his trunk to stardom. In an era where politicians were trying their darnedest to shut down, rap and MTV wasn't playing it off it wasn't ready friendly, Too Short made the type of music you didn't want your kids bumping. In today's landscape, it's average, but in the early 90's, it was insane. Short had released nine albums – 6 in studio – before he dropped <i>Gettin' It</i>, which was meant to be his retirement album. He was the first rapper to do this and fail at it. The lead single from the album was <i>Buy You Some</i>, a super bassy, funk laced joint produced by – and featuring – Erick. The funk was so thick you can hear and feel each (live) bass strum, and Erick's verse had some serious quotables.\n\n<b><i>Whateva Man</i></b>\n\nhttps://youtu.be/1iQMnehWcCk\n\nBy this point in his career, Redman was a mainstay, having released two charting albums, and solidifying himself in the game. While his sophomore project <i>Dare Iz A Darkside</i> was produced largely by himself, he decided to let someone else take the wheel here and there as he recorded his 1996 album, <i>Muddy Waters</i>. This album was the perfect blend of Red you'd come to expect from his past projects, but with a fresher, dare I say brighter, sound. It's regarded by many as his best album, and Red himself has hinted that <i>Muddy Waters 2</i> will drop in time for it's 20 year anniversary. I digress, though, as the album's lead single was the Erick laced <i>Whateva Man</i>, which got an awesome video treatment.\n\nWhat were your fave Erick Sermon joints? Sound off on our Twitter!",

    "content_html": "<blockquote>\"Can’t buy backbone, no wholesale.”\n\n– Jay Ax</blockquote>\nOriginally from Brooklyn, and currently residing in Staten Island, rapper Jay Ax is a magnetic emcee that exudes confidence – and has the skills to back it up. Over the years, Jay Ax has developed a deep music catalog comprised of 5 mixtapes, which have sold over 12,000 copies. Not that many artists these days can claim that. He's also shared stages with industry royalty like T-Pain, Wyclef Jean, Khia, Keith Murray, Jae Millz and others. His latest offering is a twenty song banger of a project entitled <i>Don’t Ax Don’t Tell</i>. It’s a solid offering that has three distinct vibes – trap/street, radio, and soulful. Over the course of the project, which may seem a bit daunting at first based on the length, Jay rides and excels the current trends and sounds that dominate the New York scene, but also gives brief glimpses into his character and personality. Please keep in mind, I'm approaching this project as a first-time listener.\n\n <a href=\"http://aboveaveragehiphop.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/IMG_3359.jpg\"><img width=\"200\" height=\"200\" alt=\"\" src=\"http://aboveaveragehiphop.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/IMG_3359.jpg\" title=\"\" class=\"alignleft size-custom\"></a> \nSongs like the radio friendly <i>Match My Fly</i>, featuring Brodie Jaymz and Bianca Bonnie, and <i>Bank On Fleek</i> show off Jay’s commercial appeal, and ability to craft joints that are timely and relevant to the current market; however, his more shining moments appear when he steps out of his lane slightly. The album’s opener <i>Commencement</i>, for example, is a slow, soulful production that features his nephew, Fortune. This flow/vibe – and even subject matter – doesn’t pop up again until later in the project. He gets more personal, and delves below the surface, on tracks like <i>Barz, </i>and the ultra hype <i>Giant</i>. On the later he drops lines like: “rebel born a pebble, now I wanna be a boulder.”\n\nMust-listens have to be the album closer, <i>Curtain Call</i>, which is a letter to a fallen comrade, and the anthemic <i>New York Gritty</i>, featuring the Brooklyn bully – and former Roc Nation soldier – Uncle Murda. As well, Jay speaks on discriminatory law practices, and the overall degradation of the relationships between police and citizens in urban areas on the songs <i>They</i> and <i>These Laws Ain’t Right</i>.\n\nJay Ax's music has a sonic confidence that comes along with both longevity and dedication. Based on his past sales, and the plays on his various profiles, his fans are eating it up. Rightfully so; this time around, he’s cooked up a hardy (long play) feast for your rides and music playing devices. Jay Ax displays – on wax – why he was considered among the best male performers at the Underground Music Awards in NYC in 2014, and why he’s ready to take his career to the next level.\n\nhttps://youtube.com/watch?v=PhoY0KBMHyQ\n\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"450\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/211066487&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true\"></iframe>",

    "content_html": "Critics have already proclaimed that Florida rapper JS is about to have his best year yet. His new single “100,” featuring Toronto hit-maker Tory Lanez is making serious waves in industry circles. The song is an old school duet song that's reminiscent of the days of Mary J. and Method Man. If the old saying “everyone loves a love song” reigns true, then this record is sure to hit big.\n\nJS, aka \"JS THE BEST\" is the son of 80's R&B/Pop Star Mini Curry – whose single \"<a href=\"https://www.google.ca/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0ahUKEwjYvtTh5s_KAhUnu4MKHQXGCf0QyCkIHjAA&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3D3X1zIobkwaI&usg=AFQjCNEBFTTCebMpubSeMKvGeXbfQcQUPw&sig2=Bq-kzWqALn-j37cMQHEbRw\">I Think I'm Over You</a>\" peaked at #34 on Billboard's Hot Black Singles chart back in the day. She also ironically had a song called \"<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KTHD7zlOaU\">100%</a>\" – different song, but still an  interesting piece of trivia. As well, his father is legendary Saxophonist Al Chisolm III. With family credentials like that, it isn’t any wonder why the people around him claim he was born for the music business. His roots can be traced from the Midwest to the Dirty South—all of which have created a profoundly eclectic style and outlook in music. He credits his influences in Motown, Rhythm and Blues, Jazz, Hip-Hop and Theater. When asked how he would describe his music, JS replied with, “<em>…hardcore, conscious, and modern.</em>”\n\n100 is the first release since his <a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/jsthebest/js-the-best-weupnation-reloaded-full-mixtape\">WEUP Nation Reloaded Mixtape</a> – and is a great to start to the year.

I have been independent, but I can see myself on a label like MellowMusicGroup or a similar situation.",

    "content_html": "<blockquote>\"If ppl are gonna just pray for the 90's sound to come back (which I respect), shit is gonna be the same forever...\"\n\n– Gavlyn (via Facebook)</blockquote>\n26-year-old LA-based rapper Gavlyn has it factor that's so prevalent it's impossible to ignore. She's been on my radar since she dropped <i><a href=\"http://brokencomplex.com/releases/from-the-art/\">From The Art </a></i>four year ago, and she has yet to disappoint. Debuting around the same time that Kreayshawn and her White Girl Mob were rising to notoriety, Gav went left, and set herself apart as an artist by building her sound around a 90's hip-hop aesthetic, which went over well – as you imagine.\n\nHer confident, (sort of) deep, distinctive voice – and actual bars – have earned her a massive following, and millions of YouTube spins. She's dropped four albums and has rocked six international tours, gracing stages with royalty in the game, like Wu-Tang Clan for example; all this before the age of 26. With her latest album, <i><a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/ca/album/make-up-for-your-break-up/id1052187301\">Make Up For Your Break Up </a></i>available for purchase worldwide, her upcoming European tour with her homegirl <a href=\"https://twitter.com/reverieLOVE?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\">Reverie</a> this April, and her imprint – <a href=\"https://facebook.com/peachhouserecords\">Peach House</a> – in effect, she shows no signs of slowing down her momentum.\n\nShe was kind enough to take some time out to do a quick Q&A for AAHIPHOP – see below. Be sure to cop <i>Make Up For Your Break Up</i> today!\n\nhttps://youtu.be/JELwIujC5-U\n\n<hr />\n\n<strong>How did you get involved in hip-hop (originally)?</strong>\n\nThe way I got involved with hip-hop originally was – obviously – being a fan of it, and growing up listening to it. I was also around cyphers as a kid and just hopped in jokingly and feel in love with it\n\n<strong>You truly do seem like an \"old soul\" – can you explain how you initially gravitated toward your sound?</strong>\n\nI have a lot of siblings that put me onto old school hip hop, and parents that introduced me to old school music in general. Not to mention, I always used to steal their CDs as a kid.\n\n<img class=\"alignleft size-full wp-image-3727\" src=\"http://aboveaveragehiphop.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Gavlyn-20-1.png\" alt=\"Gavlyn-20\" width=\"300\" height=\"430\" /><strong>\nWho were some of your influences as you were starting out?</strong>\n\nMy influences starting out were Jean Grae, Typical Cats, Little Brother, 9th Wonder, Guru, Dj Quick, Sugarfree, Snoop Dogg, and Helta Skelta.\n<strong>\nThere is so much growth from your first two albums to <em>Modest Confidence</em>. It seemed as though you/it had a different vibe (sonically). Was that something that was intentional, or was it more organic?</strong>\n\nMy growth was a little bit of both. It was intentional to show people the new direction that I was trying to go, but it was also organic trying to show people where my mind was at the time and what I was going through in my life.\n<strong>\nTell me about <i>Make Up For Your Break Up </i>– what was the concept behind the album? Was it the product of a break-up?</strong>\n\nThe meaning behind the album is whenever women go through things in life, such as a break-up, bad fight, or struggles in general, she tends to wear more makeup to cover up her emotions and how she feels.\n<strong>\nWhat advantages do you see staying independent? Have you had any interest from majors thus far?</strong>\n\nOne of the biggest advantages of being independent is being able to be your own creative director. I have had interest from majors, but none that have sold me yet.\n<strong>\nYou’re so young, but you have such an impressive catalogue thus far…what’s next for Gavlyn? What are your career goals?</strong>\n\nWhat's next for me is to define my lane and to be a voice for the young people in my generation because they haven't had the pleasures that 90's kids like myself have had to learn from the OG's of my time. I want to be able to teach kids what real music is, as opposed to all the watered down stuff that's out right now that they are unfortunately learning from.\n<strong>\nWhat projects do you have in the works for 2016?</strong>\n\nI'm working on a project right now with DJ Hoppa called 'Why Wait', which is basically about not waiting to make things happen for yourself. :) Other than that, I have a European tour in April 2016 with Reverie. Lastly, some tours in the States that will be coming up. So stay tuned for that!\n\nhttps://youtu.be/FBYM80Uwr8w\n\nhttps://youtu.be/a8F9scwwDWo\n\nAlso, she was on GGN – no big deal.\n\nhttp://youtu.be/mEu2-5Rqje0",

    "content_html": "Today, the weather was unusually warm for winter; the sun came out this afternoon, as the city (of Toronto) hit a high of 50. So, as I hit the street to make the most of this anomaly, I decided to give the homie Neb Doe a spin. The West LA native's latest EP, \"<i>3-2-1</i>,\" is the perfect blend of bassy low tempo goodness. With influences that span from Wu-Tang Clan, Nas and Eminem, to Gorillaz, Kid Cudi and Mos Def, his approach to hip-hop is sonically innovative, without being so out of the box that he loses ears. This project does an excellent job of speaking to what's in while hinting at what's next.\n\nIt kicks off with the soulful jazz saxophone driven \"<i>Intro (Symphony 35)</i>,\" where Neb's love of film bubbles to the surface amidst film stock and camera angle references. The sampled singer and echoey snaps on \"<i>They Know</i>\" create an atmospheric sound bed where Neb comes through with introspective – yet yolo-ish – live for the moment raps. The piano-driven \"<i>Oh My!</i>,\" and the Sister Sister sampled hook of <i>\"Go Home Roger,\" </i>show off Neb's ear for production. I was pleasantly surprised when I learned that all the beats were by entirely different producers, as they all have a cohesive feel.\n\n<i>\"3-2-1\"</i> has a cinematic feel to it, making it ideal soundtrack music for your movements. Neb is a wonderful example of the diversity the LA scene currently has to offer, especially with the Compton vibe dominating the airwaves. This is perfect music to bump as the sun begins to hide in the horizon, and you're rolling through the city with your windows down. Take an ear, and keep your eyes on Neb Doe!\n\nWest up!\n\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"450\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/playlists/183298522&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true\"></iframe>",

    "content_html": "Today, the New York hip-hop scene lost a prominent figure, Keith Carter – better known as DJ Big Kap. He was a member of many crews and cliques, including the Flip Squad DJ's, which also included names like Doo Wop, Biz Markie and Mark Ronson. For those of you not too familiar with Kap, he rose to notoriety in the NYC scene alongside Funkmaster Flex as a resident DJ and host at the notorious Tunnel Nightclub, which was a 90's institution, as far as urban clubs go. The club was a hangout for many of the city's, and industries, icons during our culture's most important – and grimy – hip-hop era. Every name that mattered in the 90's performed there, giving Kap unprecedented accessibility to artists.\n\nAfter much prodding, Funkmaster Flex, who by the later 90's had become a staple in the game, teamed up with Kap to release his most notable project, <i>The Tunnel</i>. In an interview, Kap lovingly referred to the project as his baby, and a three year \"labour of love.\" Although Kap failed to release many more commercial projects of that caliber, he was far from off the scene.  He was a resident DJ at numerous clubs in the big apple, toured overseas, hosted internet radio, and had plans to release a few new projects this year.\n\nHe was also a DJ for Biggie Smalls. In fact, he once notoriously (no pun intended) had a water bottle thrown at him for messing up on stage during Summer Jam 1995. He later revealed in an interview that the heat that day was causing the records to warp literally in front of his eyes. When he explained the situation to Biggie backstage, He laughed and told him that he knew the situation, but spazzed so the crowd wouldn't think he was messing up his performance. I'm sure that Kap and Big are in the clouds right now, laughing and recounting the good old days, when everything in hip-hop was lovely.\n\nHis cause of death is still unknown.\n\nI'm going to leave this with the record that put me on to Big Kap back in 1995, <i>Ladies In The House</i>, featuring Bahamadia, Lauryn Hill, Precise, Treep & Uneek.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/DlFgVf23OIk\n\nRIP to Kap, and prayers and condolences to his family.",

    "content_html": "<blockquote>\"We on to the next one, on to better things and better dreams that's in my temple, I write em' with my pencil.”\n\n– Egypt Taylor</blockquote>\nPhiladelphia has a long and prestigious history in hip-hop. One of our contributors <a href=\"http://aboveaveragehiphop.com/sounds-of-philadelphia/\">once began to break it down</a>, but a timeline that starts with names like Schooly D and Fresh Prince, and leads to names like Beanie Siegel and Meek Mill, the city has long emblazoned its unique mark on hip-hop culture. But it’s a new day, and new voices are emerging. Once of these new voices is Egypt Taylor – a member of The <a href=\"http://www.foursevenmgmt.com/#music-section\">Prodigies</a> collective. Currently, on tour with the collective, Egypt has been busy prepping a new EP, but – alongside the release of Kanye’s <em>Waves</em> album – is dropping a new song titled <em>Champion</em>, produced by Kanye West himself.\n\nNeedless to say, having a song produced by Kanye West is a great look for such a new artist; actually, that's an understatement. A Kanye West beat in 2016 is something most artists will <em>never</em> achieve! We wanted to learn more about the song, so we linked up with Egypt for a quick Q&A. Check that out below, and take an ear to <em>Champion</em>, produced by Kanye.\n\n[wonderplugin_audio id=\"3\"]\n\n<hr />\n\n<strong>How did you get into hip-hop?\n</strong>\nI got into hip-hop growing up around my cousin Kravitz, who was a producer at the time. He would make beats on his AKAI pad, and I would try to make my poems flow over his beats.\n\n<strong>Who are/were some of your influences?\n</strong>\nMy main influences would have to be MF DOOM, Jay-Z, Kool & The Gang, and, of course, Kanye.\n\n<strong>Can you describe your sound?\n</strong>\nI don’t have a particular sound that I consistently aim for when writing a song. The sound I hope to deliver varies from project to project and usually depends on how I'm feeling on that particular day. But I usually get that I have an old-school hip-hop sound in a lot of my tracks.\n\n<strong>Tell me about your new track champion? How did the song come together?\n</strong>\nChampion is a crazy song. It’s different from my other projects, mainly because of the production. Kanye’s influence and work ethic makes the song stand out, which is great because it allowed me to write from a different creative perspective.\n\n<strong>Have you been sitting on this track for a while?\n</strong>\nYea, we were sitting on this track for a couple of months. The sound didn't fit the tone of my upcoming EP or anything I had planned on releasing soon, so we decided it was best to release it as a single along with the upcoming release of “Waves.”\n\n<strong>With the release of waves, this is pretty great timing on your part. Besides Ye What other artists are you currently working with?\n</strong>\nYea, the timing is bittersweet. Kanye is a great producer and artist and has established himself as such. Having the exposure from a music legend is helpful for an upcoming artist, but it can also overshadow your work as a relatively underground artist. I am currently working on a track with Lil 100 from SODMG and a project with my collective member APEX Predator.\n\n<strong>What should we be looking out for?</strong>\n\nYou should most certainly be bracing yourself for APEX Predator’s self-titled, debut EP dropping on Feb. 15. As well as a few tracks featuring me and Kurt from Good Money Empire.\n\n<strong>Do you have an LP on the horizon?</strong>\n\nNo. There is a debut EP on the horizon though with some crazy features. Look out for that around late spring/early summer.\n\n<strong>What can you tell us about the prodigies?</strong>\n\nThe Prodigies is hip-hop collective and the title of the collective’s debut EP. Collective members APEX Predator and Vaniah, are the main artists featured on the EP. It was released to give listeners a glance at the different vibes and sounds the collective hopes to deliver on their individual projects.\n\n<strong>How has the tour been thus far?</strong>\n\nThe tour has been amazing. As an upcoming artist, it is always great to get that initial support from your fans and listeners. Seeing people rock with you to your art at a live performance is motivating and encouraging.\n\n<strong>What has been your favorite show thus far?</strong>\n\nThe Philadelphia hip-hop scene as a whole has been my personal favorite place to perform. From the El to the venues, to Love Park, Philadelphians have always shown support, and that’s mad dope being a non-native to Philly.\n\n<strong>Are you guys working on more projects like this?</strong>\n\nYea, we hope to release more projects like this from other members of the collective to bring together the various sounds of different members on one whole project.\n\n<strong>What are your goals in the music industry?</strong>\n\nMy goals as an artist are to continue to inspire others to create long lasting, and call-to-action music. Music is an excellent form of communication because it reaches the general public daily. Aside from writing about wildlife experiences, I hope to create meaningful songs that inspire others to do good and bring unity to humanity.\n\n<strong>What is one thing you'd like your listeners to know about you as an artist?</strong>\n\nI want my listeners to know that I am human, and I have emotions. They change daily and sometimes hourly. Those emotions and feelings can be heard and felt in my projects and may seem to produce an inconsistency. But I am always the same person despite the sound of my music.\n\n<strong>Do you have any last words for our readers?</strong>\n\nIf you can think it, you can do it.

    "content_html": "Have you ever dreamed of starting your internet radio station? Although you'd think that Internet technology would have made such a task incredibly easy, until late, it was quite cumbersome and expensive – almost unattainable by either those without a serious budget or above average computer skills. Services like Shoutcast were not for novices on a broadcaster or listener side, and the logistics of streaming 24 hours were, well, hard to overcome.\n\nThat was then; this is now. New service, <a href=\"http://ScatterRadio.com\">ScatterRadio</a>, is allowing artists and wanna-be shock jocks the ability to start their free streaming radio station, and stream 24/7 via the web, or the ScatterRadio app. As an artist you can stream your entire catalogue, as a company/brand, you could stream commercials or infomercials. As a connoisseur with an awesome collection of music, you can simply play curator and share your playlist with the community.\n\n<a href=\"http://ScatterRadio.com\">ScatterRadio</a> is more than just a radio playing application, though, as it allows users to chat and discuss the topics and music being played on the various channels. This could be an incredibly important feature and engagement measure for artists/labels looking for feedback on new/unsigned acts, or brands looking for feedback on products or services they're offering. It truly is a platform for the people, by the people.\n\nIf you're an unsigned artist who doesn't have the time to put into creating your station, or you simply just want to get your name out there, ScatterRadio is also offering to play unsigned artists on their <a href=\"http://scatterradioblog.com/2016/01/28/newmusic-trending-now-on-scatterradio/\">new/trending music channel</a>s. That means you can send your music to ScatterRadio, as they curate channels specifically for new music the ranges from rock to hip-hop and rap.\n\nSo give ScatterRadio a try; if not to start your channel at first, at least, to take a listen to what other users are currently doing on the platform.",

We got a chance to catch up with <a href=\"https://twitter.com/boozshi\">Boozshi</a> Music executive <a href=\"http://www.bmi.com/news/entry/shawn_campbell_songwriting_and_starmaking_his_way_to_the_top\">Shawn Campbell </a>and get some good advice. Shawn is a Grammy-nominated producer and songwriter who has worked with musical heavy hitters like Missy Elliott, Jay-Z, Chris Brown, Foxy Brown and others; so, he knows what he's talking about!\n\n<hr>\n\n<b>Thanks for spending a little time with us!</b>\n\nNo Worries!\n\n<b>So pull back the veil a little bit for us. What is the music business like?</b>\n\nMan (shaking head) it is not for the faint of heart, that’s for sure. But I love it. It’s exhilarating. It is the kindof business where everything is oversized. When you win, you do so in spectacular fashion. When you fail, you do so in spectacular fashion.”\n\n<b>What would you say is the most consistent quality or an artist to have to make it?</b>\n\nThere are 2 qualities to have that can help you thrive where others don’t. My experience is that the truly successful people in this business have a high tolerance for rejection. They are also great sales people. Notice I didn’t mention talent in that list.\n\n<b>We did. Why is that?</b>\n\nTalent is obviously a big deal but most artist suffer under the delusion that once talent is demonstrated, that labels will come looking for them. The truth is that labels reject the most mind blowingly talented artist every day. Then they turn around and sign lesser talented artist. Why? Because the lesser talented artist is a better salesman and sold his music to the public in a convincing manner.\n\n<b>Is that how you were able to get so many artists signed?</b>\n\nYes. I have pitched acts to everyone from Justin Timberlake to LA Reid. But I never introduce an artist until we have proven that there is public interest. That takes the “No” away before they even have time to think it.",

    "content_html": "It's been ten years since the great J.Dilla left us; however, his legacy is still burning as strong as ever. There are a few reasons for this. One is that his collaborators, friends, and family continue to keep his brand relevant, with new releases and merchandise. Two, his – awe inspiring – catalogue contains timeless classics that will never fade.\n\nAs a writer, I'm well aware that my opinions might not always match yours, the reader. That's because music is a very personal experience, often tied to very specific memories, emotions, etc. My personal relationship with Dilla's music dates back to 1995 when I was on a school trip. While at a mall in Montreal, I purchased a copy of The Pharcyde's <i>Labcabincalifornia</i>. It's a tape that was not only a turning point and catalyst for my twenty plus year odyssey into the hip-hop rabbit hole, but is also something I still own today. There were other producers on that album, but Dilla's bassline on the album's into song, <i><a href=\"http://youtu.be/UhecITFLbPs\">Bullshit</a></i> had me open from the first lick. <i><a href=\"https://youtu.be/co3qMdkucM0\">Drop</a></i> was another joint that really f@&ked my head, and the Spike Jonez video took it to a whole other level. In fact, it stands as one of the coolest most original videos I've ever seen. The most important record, though, was <i>Runnin'</i>. I will stand and argue with anyone who disagrees that <i>Runnin'</i> was not Dilla's best beat; period. Much like Will Smith's <i>Summertime</i> and Aaliyah's <i>One In A Million</i>, the song will always have a place in my heart – as it's been with me thoughout some high highs and low lows in my life. Funny how music can do that.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/BxoFScgRFIY\n\nDilla's production was captivating, and right down to his final days, he put everything he had into his music. He was his music, and his music was him. I think this deep connection and his creative aura was what made his music so...charismatic...so, timeless. Dilla was an innovator who fathered in a neo-soul vibe into the hip-hop landscape and inspired a generation of crate-digging hip-hop producers, who in turn will inspire the next generation.\n\nSo, I'll end this piece with an RIP to one of the greatest producers who ever did it – the late, great, J Dilla.\n\nHappy Dilla Day. Here's a 12 minutes Dilla Video-Mix.\n\nhttp://youtu.be/X72wmdXNJHs",

I took a few listens of their super bassy <em>On & On</em> record on Soundcloud, which has well over 400k plays thus far, and knew I wanted to get these guys up on AAHIPHOP. With some impressive social traction and some radio spins under their belts, they seem primed to take things to the next level. Check out their latest <a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/leavingtheecstasy/sets/quickfix\">mixtape</a>, and the Q&A below!\n\nEarly!\n\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/239500105&color=ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false\"></iframe>\n\n<hr />\n\n<strong>How did you guys get together as a group?\n</strong>\nSully: We were friends years before we ever started recording together. Dee had already had a mixtape out called dreams and nightmares way before Meek Mill ever came up with it. We were at my house one night and talking about music; I showed him some of the stuff I had recorded when I started recording a few years ago and then it was like instant working chemistry. \n\n<strong>Tell me about<em> The Quickfix Mixtape</em>. Are you guys also working on solo projects?</strong>\n\nSully: <em>The Quickfix Mixtape</em> is a short collection of songs 5-7 from us that gives a taste of what we're doing while we are working on our solo projects. It's usually just composed of songs we wrote and had fun with, like when you hear something that you know you should have another rapper on, I immediately call Dee and that's another one for the Quickfix. \n\nDdaboi: <em>The Quickfix Mixtape</em> is a series that we're working on consistently. It's a unique yet addictive sound it's giving you the feeling of something new but something you want to hear again, something that you crave, kind of like a drug, that's why we call it the <em>Quickfix</em>. \n\nSully: We are both working on solo projects. Mine is going to be called <em>Silver Lining</em> which might end up a working title. I\nwant it to be a mixture of sounds and jazz and soul influences like \"section 80\" and \"acid rap\". \n\nDdaboi: My project is called <em>The Event</em>. It's based on life experience I've been through, kind of like a story. Similar to how The Weeknd vibes on his projects, It'll be a combination of R&B and rap. \n<strong>\nWhat are you guys working on next?</strong>\n\nDdaboi: <em>Quickfix Volume 2</em>! (Laughs)\n\nSully: Pretty much. It's Vol. 2 first because we're getting a real push for it, especially on SoundCloud. We've had songs on the radio, been added to artist rosters; we haven't \"blown up\" yet -- but we damn sure have opened some doors, but Vol.2 is going to knock the whole wall down. \n\n<strong>What are your goals in this industry?\n</strong>\nSully: I just want to be big enough that I can do this for a living. That I can take a hobby that I enjoy and put energy Into and it becomes who I am instead of something I do. That would be an ideal life for me. \n\nDdaboi: My goal is to get signed to a good label that I can depend on that will put out my album instead of constant delays. Earn a lot of fans. \n<strong>\nWhat do you want people to take away from you as artists?</strong>\n\nDdaboi: That I'm going to be one of the greatest inspirations in music, and you're watching me on the come-up. This is the moment before it happens. \n\nSully: I want them to see that we're young with almost no resources and we're already making moves. Like from where I'm from you can't do this type of stuff.\n\nSully: They don't allow this kind of shit, nobody wants you to be successful; but, only the actual artists get that. We're doing it for everybody, if one of us makes it, there's a chance a lot more people can make it. Because musically, it feels like a wasteland here sometimes, but it's just starting to bubble for us, and it's happening. \n\nDdaboi: We're young, but it already feels like we have enough talent to push up into the big leagues, it just takes one good chance. This is just the first tape, imagine how much we're going to progress on to the next. \n<strong>\nAre you guys looking to get signed -- or stay indie?</strong>\n\nDdaboi: I'm not looking for just a deal, I'm looking for the right deal. \n\nSully: Only if it's right. So many artists get shit deals, yes they're okay, they got money, and they got, at least, top 10 hit, but it limits their creative freedom and growth. I'd like some freedom when it comes to my music. I don't mind a slight push in a particular direction, but I'd like to do my own thing as well or what's the point?",

    "content_html": "<blockquote>“All that talk and you ain’t saying nothing; real ones get it done, end of discussion…”   \n\n--Rochester</blockquote>\nAs a longtime resident of the fine city of Toronto, which has since lovingly been renamed as the “6,” I've watched – and heard – the local scene grow through a few eras. I’ve become increasingly aware of the substantial amount of NYC content we've been serving here at AAHIPHOP, and I’m starting to feel like a dick. In the wake of the city’s newfound fame, It seems like a perfect time to put on my metaphorical Jay’s cap and start repping my city a little more.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PYTdQiPUaI\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V4iUQHcshE\n\n<em>Don't call it a comeback, he's been here for years!\n</em>\nThis time around, I want to talk about a cat named Rochester aka Juice. After winning Flow 93.5’s (the city’s primary mainstream urban radio station) Flow Search Showcase in 2002, he pretty much hit the ground running. My first introduction to him as an artist was his Caribana themed video for the catchy single <em>Do It</em> off of his <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V4iUQHcshE\">debut album</a>. The years that followed saw him drop numerous songs/videos, rock stages with industry elite like G-Unit, and become the face of numerous campaigns for brands like the -- now defunct -- Athlete’s World stores, and  Much Music’s Much Vibe, a 24/7 urban video station. Now, a decade since first bumping Juice, I’m sitting here checking out his latest EP, KARMAZABXTCH. It’s an eight-song offering that’s fresh, relevant and a wonderful way for Juice to reassert himself on the Toronto music landscape.\n\nKicking off with the club banger, Bad Girl, Rochester shows off an evolved flow that’s very “2016 Toronto.” His production is handled by some dope local beatsmiths, like J.Staffz and Anon London Beats. If I had to sum up the albums content, I’d say it ranges; He gets sexy on the bassy joints <em>Say When</em> and <em>Karma Sutra</em>, he gets personal on the lost love/broken heart vibe of <em>Wounded Lips</em> and goes all out on the EP closer <em>Now Or Never</em>.\n\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/236011608&color=ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false\"></iframe>\n\nRochester seems like he was a decade too early; the level of notoriety he gained up here would have been mega-amplified within the scope of this “New-Toronto” wave that Drake, and cats like Jazz Cartier and Tory Lanez, seemed to have set-off. KARMAZABXTCH is sure to reignite the flame Rochester has ignited many times before. This time, though, all eyes are on the 6. With a few well-placed visuals (which Juice is known to drop), he could be looking at a whole new career plateau.\n \nEarly!\n\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"450\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/playlists/182536872&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true\"></iframe>",

FDA took things to the next level, though, after his hit single <i>Trap House</i> generated over 500,000 hits via YouTube. His solo album, “Made It,” sold over 5,000 hard copies and 20,000 digital copies online. Not bad, right?\n\nFresh off of the release of his solo album <i>Fame</i>, I had the pleasure of taking in his newest EP, <i>Keep It 1000</i>. It's a solid collection of tracks, with heavy hitting trap production and features from the likes of \"Mr. Never Tired\" himself, Kevin Gates, on <i>I Know It</i>, and Billboard top 100 artist – and 2013 XXL Freshman – Kirko Bangz, on the \"steal your girl\" anthem, <i>All Into Her.</i> The EP is a poignant message to rappers who talk a good game, but are ultimately unable to live up to the opulence and street life they preach. He also spends a great deal of time highlighting his hustle, on tracks such as <i>Grind</i> and <i>No Time</i>, where he drops bars like: <em>\"no time to turn up, this hustle isn't a side grind.\"</em> While you're out partying, FDA is putting in work. That`s probably why his social networks are revving and buzzing like chainsaws.\n\nIndeed, he's focused, primed, and taking no prisoners. The name of the project alone, suggests that he's curbing the supposed authenticity of his peers, which seems to suit him just fine. The trust issues he discusses at various points throughout the project are likely due to the industry's obsession with keeping it \"100\" for the gram. With a solo-dolo work ethic, crisp accompanying visuals and features definitely beyond the budget of your favourite neighbourhood rapper, FDA's stroll to the to the top of the pack looks leisurely.\n\nEarly.\n\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"450\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/playlists/193363648&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true\"></iframe>\n\nhttp://youtu.be/qGjCaE3Zlp8\n\nhttp://youtu.be/oNncb-rCtr4",

    "content_html": "Remember the song <i>Ghetto Bastard</i> by Naughty by Nature? Well, when I was coming of age (mind you, a few years after it's initial release), that song connected with me on multiple levels. In my grown-up hindsight, that song did a fantastic job of detailing the dire environmental influences on the lifestyle so many urban youths both portrayed and lived in the early-mid 90s. That's what was running through my head as I was listening to a young Palm Beach County Florida rapper by the name of Stackz. His latest mixtape <i>Trill Thoughts Book 2</i> had me thinking about both the crazy shit a lot of youth have to live through today, and how the next generation's unprecedented access to everything makes it possible for more and more young voices to paint pictures of life in America, which is often a dark place.\n\nLike fellow Florida rapper Stitches, Stackz portrays rap life, complete with guns, drugs, bitches and, well, you get it; albeit, he much less aggressive than Stitches, which allows you actually to take in what he's dropping. The jump-off track on this mixtape, <i>Yea Hoe</i>, as well as, songs like the bassy <i>Bidness Only Bidness</i>, and <i>We Gon Get It N---a</i>, give a sort of flat first-impression. By that I mean, they are sonically solid, but do little to distinguish Stackz from any other artist currently riding the trappy-wave. It's in later songs, though, like the revealing <i>No Apologies</i>, the super dope <i>Letter To My First Love</i>, and the unapologetically west-coast <i>Ride</i> that we get more of a glimpse of Stackz' trials and tribulations. He allows us his hear him explore different types of production, and – in essence – find his sound. A standout for me was the last track he served up, <i>Welcome Back</i>, a soulful joint that really showcases his flow.\n\nAt just 21, Stackz is off to a great start. He covered a lot of ground with this effort, so it will be interesting to see where he takes us next. He's noted that he's dedicated to bringing lyricism and polished flows back to the southern hip hop genre. If he's any indication of the potential the next generation of cats the Florida rap has, then the south may rise a la No-Limit-days again.\n\nEarly.\n\n<iframe src=\"http://www.datpiff.com/embed/mee00ca6/\" width=\"525\" height=\"270\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe>",

Known professionally as T.B, the Memphis, Tennessee-native and Fire Proof 1 Records artist is actually “walking on faith.\" From feeding the homeless to ministering at local churches, T.B isn’t giving back to the community for a photo opp or more likes on social media; it’s truly his passion to use his platform as an artist to be of service to others. His selfless volunteer work even earned him recognition – and an award – from President Obama, who proclaimed “Your volunteer service demonstrates the kind of commitment to your community that moves America a step closer to its great promise.” Pretty impressive right?\n\nShortly after accepting his award, T.B made headlines for turning down a deal worth six figures. He decided not to roll with the force behind two of the most successful artists in the industry – Yo Gotti and Future –  because he didn’t want to be “subconsciously influenced” to change his music. That’s a bold statement; although, he clearly has a good head on his shoulders. In 2015, he wrapped his Sinner 2 A Saint 2 Tour, become an MTV Artist, and released the official Memphis Grizzlies Song during their playoff run.\n\nCheck out T.B's new Single <em>Walk On Gold</em>, featuring Swift (formally known as R-Swift).",

    "content_html": "It's crazy that 19 years have elapsed since the rap game lost Notorious B.I.G. By many accounts, he was one of the most influential artists ever to touch a mic. you'd be hard-pressed to find a New York, New York, emcee (over 30) who doesn't name him as a figure of artistic admiration – and why not? He was a true rag to riches story. In fact, I'd argue that his breakthrough Juicy is one of the greatest \"we made it\" musical-mantras in hip-hop. He was loyal, funny, and innovative. He put a LOT of artists on and is the reason many artists are eating today. He was a nucleus of New York street-hop, and had he not been killed, he'd likely be a jigga-esque figure today.\n\nIndeed, a lot of careers would have played out differently. His group, The Commission, which included Jay-Z and Charlie Baltimore, never saw the light of day; however, had he survived, their debut would undoubtedly be a hit. Where, though would that have left Kanye West? Jay-Z intertwined work with Biggie may have left listeners with fewer solo albums. As well, Diddy's Hitmen production team, which included the likes of D-Dot and Stevie J, would have handled a bulk of the Commission, and as a byproduct, Hova production.\n\nOne can only speculate about his love life, but (assuming things played out exactly as they did), you may see Jay and B sitting coutside with Biggie and Kim – or maybe Biggie and Charlie Baltimore? Where would many of the lost/forgotten Bad Boy artists have ended up? Would Brooklyn Mint have become as monumental as Rocawear?\n\nSigh; so many what ifs.\n\nThere have been an endless stream of Biggie remixes, blends, and faux features, but it's especially fun to consider who he'd work with if he were alive today, and putting in work. We've compiled a few ideas below.\n\n<iframe src=\"http://www.audiomack.com/embed4-album/aboveaveragehh/what-if-biggie-collabo-mash-up-verses\" width=\"100%\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe>\n\n<b>Drake</b>\n\n<img src=\"http://static.spin.com/files/2015/10/Drake-Chunky-Knit-Sweater-Hotline-Bling.gif\" alt=\"\" width=\"100%\" />\n\nIt's hard to imagine than an artist as big (no pun intended) as Biggie wouldn't work with Drake. A definite sign of making it (in today's landscape) is collaborating within the circle of royalty that includes Ye, Jigga, T.I and Jeezy. Biggie would have rounded out that list. Imagine Biggie verses on Drake's biggest hits, like The Motto, or his classic posse cut with Ye and Eminem. Biggie may have certainly had some beef, assuming he'd been defending his crown for over two decades. So, imagine – if you will – him addressing his grievances on Drizzy's newest hit, \"Summer 16.\" Wow.\n\n<b>Kanye</b>\n\n<img src=\"https://m.popkey.co/4c3cb0/vzy7J.gif\" alt=\"\" width=\"100%\" />\n\nNo brainer, assuming Kanye's career path happened exactly as it did, by this time he would have likely collaborated extensively with Biggie. Perhaps he would have had him talking his fly shit over the chimpmunk soul wave that drowned the airwaves circa 2001 (the Oh Boy era). It's especially interesting to imagine Biggie riding along with this new Yeezus chapter of Kanye's career. We've imagined BIG dropping bars on Ye's The Life Of Pablo album, specifically on the ultra dope Friends. Perhaps a verse dedicated to Puff and the Junior Mafia?\n\n<b>Kendrick Lamar</b>\n\n<img src=\"https://49.media.tumblr.com/dbe8e470cdc48124c552973f11efc71c/tumblr_nqziq4Jlje1uyj9d2o1_500.gif\" alt=\"\" width=\"100%\" />\n\nKing Kunta, the Compton wonder-child, would almost have certainly been a worthy collaborator for the King Of New York. This rings especially true if you stop to consider Biggie's infatuation with the West – as heard on the epic Goin Back To Cali off of Life After Death. It's likely that we might have seen a slew of West Coast collaborations throughout the late 90's and at the turn of the century. Who knows, his love of the warmer coast may have seen him cross paths with Madlib or Dilla during Stone Throw's rise to infamy. Kunta's grandeur within the circle of rapper's rappers seem to suggest that he'll remain name on tongues for years to come – a pillar of the game not unlike B.I.G. Let's imagine Biggie dropping a verse on K.Dot's Alright joint; hot right?\n\n<b>Justin Bieber</b>\n\n<img src=\"http://popcrush.com/files/2014/02/tumblr_n0wjsnrsaY1traztgo1_500.gif\" alt=\"\" width=\"100%\" />\n\nWith the success of Hypnotize, and Mo Money, Mo Problems, Biggie was clearly able to attain and mainstream crossover success. With label-mate Ma$e also following in his footsteps and helping Bad Boy rake in mad dough, it's clear that making radio friendly shit, and dropping 16's on charting radio hits was a profitable endeavor. The formula has always existed – and it's likely Bieber may have tapped the Brooklynite for a verse, or perhaps vice-versa. It's all business and these days, Bieber is good money! Can you imagine Biggie's vocal tone blessing uptempo club records like Sorry\n\n<b>Beyoncé</b>\n\n<img src=\"http://photon.hypb.st/hypetrak.com/images/2016/02/beyonce-formation-gif-18.gif\" alt=\"\" width=\"100%\" />\n\nNo brainer – just saying.\n\n<b>Taylor Swift</b>\n\n<img src=\"https://media.giphy.com/media/GlYeU30GX4rnO/200w.gif\" alt=\"\" width=\"100%\" />\n\nFollowing the same logic I applied to the Bieber example, there's a chance that Biggie may have worked with someone like Taylor. Before you say anything, she collaborated with K.Dot on Bad Blood – imagine an alternate remix with Biggie, though?",

    "content_html": "It’s been 19 years today since the Notorious BIG passed away; although, it seems like yesterday for OG heads. Often included in the average MC’s top list, Biggie was a highly influential figure in the NYC scene, and was responsible for helping a lot of people solidify their names in the rap world. For the past (almost) two decades since his passing, many DJ’s have tried their hand at crafting remixes and re-working the (sadly) limited amount of material he left us with, attempting to give fans a new B.I.G experience. I’ve taken the liberty of rounding-up three of the best – and most creative – Biggie tapes I've come across.\n<b>\n“Rap Phenomenon”\nDJ Vlad & DJ Dirty Harry</b>\n\n<a href=\"http://www.livemixtapes.com/mixtapes/21/rap_phenomenon.html\"><img width=\"100%\" alt=\"\" src=\"http://aboveaveragehiphop.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/img_1716-1.jpg\" title=\"\" class=\"size-custom\"></a><b>\n</b>\nIf you’ve never heard this tape, it easily stands as one of the finest – and most iconic – Notorious B.I.G mixtapes out there. This installment of their award winning \"Rap Phenomenon\" series was an example of both Vlad in his prime, almost a decade away from launching VladTV.com, and DJ Dirty Harry's legendary blending. The two traded over forty mind-blowing original mixes; keep in mind, this was pre-torrent days, so their stock of Biggie accapellas was a big deal. Especially the (then) rare ones like “Cars Sex,” “Buddy X,” and “House Of Pain.”\n\n<b>“Best Of Notorious BIG”\nDJ M-Rock</b>\n\n<a href=\"https://m.mixcloud.com/themixfeed/dj-m-rock-the-best-of-notorious-big/\"><img width=\"100%\"' alt=\"\" src=\"http://aboveaveragehiphop.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/img_1736-1.jpg\" title=\"\" class=\"size-custom\"></a>\n\nAward-winning Toronto DJ, M-Rock, has made massive noise over the past few years. He rocks parties as a resident DJ in the 6, had MTV nodding to his mixtapes, and had CNN mentioning his remixes. He’s received widespread blog love for his “Best Of” mixes, including Beastie Boys and Kanye West, but this Biggie mix is a sheer masterpiece. Unlike some of the mixes out there, it’s heavily cut up – making it an extremely original/exciting listen.\n\n<b>“The Notorious BIG Tribute”\nDJ Drama & Cookin Soul</b>\n\n<a href=\"http://aboveaveragehiphop.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/img_1737-1.jpg\"><img src=\"http://aboveaveragehiphop.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/img_1737-1.jpg\" width=\"100%\" alt=\"\"></a>\n\nThis one is more of a tribute in the literal sense. Drama and Cookin’ Soul rounded up a who’s who of NYC rappers, like Tek of Smiff N Wessun, Skyzoo, CL Smooth, Jean Grae, Uncle Murda and more. It features original and remixed production, as the artists pay tribute to one of the greatest to ever touch a mic.\n\nSalute the king of Brooklyn.",

    "content_html": "I'm always blindsided but lengthy milestones. That's part of getting older, though. I remember like it was yesterday, being a young cat at summer Caribbean street festivals copping mixtapes (like actual tapes) from local and out of town vendors. One day I came across a cassette from a name I'd heard before, Tony Touch. The tape in question was the first instalment of the illustrious Power Cypher series, better known as the 50 MC's. I spent that evening blown out, wearing down my rewind button, trying to memorize quotes. Apparently, that was 20 years ago – ouch!\n\nThe tapes featured three volumes, and a who's who of golden era New York City artists, most in their 90's prime, dropping freestyles – at various levels of off the top-ness. The sheer coordination of all 150 original freestyles, is a work of art. With the added touch (no pun intended) of actual turntablism, these tapes stand as a time capsule that represents a particular segment of not just my life, but that of many heads that grew up within the bubble of 90's hip-hop. It's a humbling listen. Next to 5 Fingaz Of Death, it stands collectively as my fave mixtape of all-time.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/UjZQvNDpLFQ\n\nNow, a seemingly distant twenty years later, Tony is planning to celebrate the milestone with live dates and parties throughout the summer. In the meantime, we've compiled all three instalments here for you to jam – complete with the tracklisting.

    "content_html": "The West-Kardashian clan certainly knows how to command the internet's attention. A few short days after Kim announced via Twitter that she had paid off Kanye's massive $53 million debt – and broke the web with her NSFW Instagram post – Ye took to Twitter and announced that Adidas was set to produce one million pairs of Yeezy Boosts in 2016. This is welcomed news for those anxious to get their hands on the coveted sneakers. The move would make sense, considering that upon their initial release last year -- and subsequent drops -- the sneakers have sold out in mere minutes; however, the production run was dramatically lower than one million. In fact, the last Moonrock drop was around 80,000 units.\n\nThe lack of availability has had mixed responses from sneaker heads, and driven up prices online, which have surpassed $1200 dollars on many online marketplaces. This enormous ramp-up in production could help more fans get their feet into Boosts this year.\n\n2016 has been fruitful thus far for Kanye, with TLOP enjoying a positive reception from fans, Season 3 selling out Madison Square Garden in ten minutes and streaming around the world, and the birth -- and grand reveal -- of his son, Saint. This announcement, which has yet to be confirmed by Adidas, comes fresh on the heels of the news that TLOP physical copies would be available within a few weeks.\n\nWe'll have to wait for official confirmation, as Kanye's Twitter has been known be a mix of both informative truths and ranty pie-in-the-sky rhetoric. Perhaps in 2016, though, Yeezy will definitively \"jump over Jumpman.\"",

In 2009, he claimed the position as the 8th most popular non-music profile on MySpace, which is a big deal. Since the fall of the Ill-fated social behemoth, Steve has managed to stay relevant – launching numerous fashion and web endeavours. As of late, he's been hitting various after-hours spots dropping a crazy new early 2000's, PC-sound/hip-hop infused set – and recently he announced he's dropping an official mixtape dropping the end of the month via Soundcloud.

    "content_html": "Meet The Family -- a ghost production team out of Sydney, Australia, and New York. They've been working on the global hip hop scene for over a decade and are now coming out of the dark to start working with upcoming talented rappers. This is sure only to be the beginning of the sounds we hear from this uber-talented outfit. Get to know a little more about them in the Q&A below.\n\n<hr />\n\n<strong>how did you guys get together?\n</strong>\nBeen friends for over ten years. Started out meeting one another through club nights as all members were DJ's in earlier careers before moving across to production.\n\n<strong>How did you get involved in hip-hop?\n</strong>\nWe work alongside a range of fashion and technology companies – and over the course of this have met numerous urban industry based celebrities. A big part was the music, and the members of The Family truly fell in love with the sounds that are currently being put out. We had to get involved!\n\n<strong>Who were some of your influences?\n</strong>\nBiggest influence by far is 808 mafia. Southside & TM88 are truly gods when it comes to rap production, not even rap, but production -- period! For years, they have inspired us and continue to be on the absolute front foot of any new sounds being developed; most of the time, they are the developers.\n\n<strong>Tell me about your music -- what are you currently working on?\n</strong>\nWe are mute about the production work we do until it is available. We have swiftly brought our attention to the booming rap scene indeed starting to emerge in Australia, Brisbane as a hub for all of this. Over the coming months, you will see some releases from some talented individuals, again all being Australian artists.\n\n<strong>Who are some of the artists you've produced for?\n</strong>\n99% of what we do is ghostwriting. We don't discuss who and what we write for, this being the sole reason we are venturing out on our own so we can share the whole process and everything we are doing with fans of the music.\n\n<strong>How would you describe your sound?\n</strong>\nUptempo BPM / Driven 808 Lines / Energetic & Explosive Leads - In short, an absolute power punch of sound. \n\n<strong>What's your creative process like?\n</strong>\nIt varies. We can make music inside the studio or come together with ideas almost complete. We usually try to approach every production with no pre-meditated plan, what sounds good and is up to the standard is what we do! Our team takes inspiration from everything such as fashion and technology.\n\n<strong>What are your goals in the industry?\n</strong>\nWe want to bring Australian hip hop to the masses with a much more professional and modernised approach.

    "content_html": "Atlanta, home to acts like Usher and the entire Dungeon Family, is busting at the seams with urban talent. One of the city's newest voices we've come across is hip-hop singer Tre Cartel. His latest EP entitled <i>Real M.C.</i> is currently available pretty much everywhere you can acquire digital music. It's a single producer project, with Mizunderstood Ru helming the bulk of the work,  aside from production collabos with BeatzByNasty and BassHaus. It's a solid project, and admittedly my introduction to Tre. His sound is unique; it's hard to put my finger on, but it makes me think of a slowed/screwed up Bone-Thugs-N-Harmony, blended with cadence elements of A-Plus from Souls Of Mischief -- it stands out. The EP is full of slow, bassy, intoxicated ballads -- perfect for midnight movements. Tre notes that His main influences are artists such as Tory Lanez, PartNextDoor, The Weeknd, Jimi Hendrix and Wiz Khalifa. <i>Real M.C</i>., which stands for stands for Mizunderstood Cartel, is a subtle nod to all the above while breaking new ground.\n\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"450\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/251204260&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true\"></iframe>\n\nStandout joint here is the \"Lost Boyz\" tinged <i>You Bad</i>.

    "content_html": "This morning as I woke up -- sort of -- for a (brief) few minutes, my wife broke the news to me: Phife, of A Tribe, Called Quest, had passed. His cause of death was not immediately disclosed, although, as intimately disclosed in their Michael Rapaport produced documentary, he had in the past suffered kidney failure and required a transplant to survive. It's likely that his death was the result of complications of diabetes, a condition that also claimed the life of my biological father.\n\nHis passing hits me -- and I assume most hip-hop heads -- quite hard. I consider A Tribe Called Quest to be my favourite group of all time. That's not just something I say, either. I walked into a store at the age of 11 and purchased <i>Low-End Theory</i> on Cassette, and often consider <i>Midnight Marauders</i>, the second album I ever purchased on CD, to be amongst my most treasured. The Tribe have been a mainstay in my life, and the passing of Phife closes a chapter in hip-hop that many of us never wanted to close. Phife was a true emcee and a living/breathing testament to everything we loved about New York/Eastcoast hip-hop in the 90's. \n\nIt's a beautiful thing that he was able to patch up his differences with Q-Tip, though. The fact that he was able to reunite, as recently as November, to perform classics, and celebrate the 25 year legacy of the group is a magical thing that Phife got to experience, and that we -- as fans -- got to see him experience. I can proudly say that I saw A Tribe Called Quest (in their entirety) live in concert, and will treasure the moment forever.\n\nHe leaves behind a legacy that will never tarnish; Phife will always remain a timeless figure in the foundation of the culture us purists hold dear. Prayers and condolences to his family -- and peace to the Zulu Nation.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/KZS_uKhNff4\nhttps://youtu.be/85mVr_TMf18\nhttps://youtu.be/WHRnvjCkTsw\nhttps://youtu.be/1QWEPdgS3As\nhttps://youtu.be/OIah18jcJko",

    "content_html": "<em>Photo credit: Mamboso.net\n</em>\nHip-hop, in it's current iteration, comes -- and goes -- in waves. The waves all have catalysts (like Drake, Kid Cudi, or younger drill gods like Keef, Santana, and Dirk), and set the stage for a tsunami of similarity. Rappers, influenced by other rappers, borrow flows which influence other rappers; you see where I'm going. The cycle continues until one brave soul goes against the grain and challenges the norm, setting off another chain reaction. It's hard to imagine fully an artist without a direct influence or at least a point of reference. Well, perhaps you haven't heard of Coke La Rock, widely accepted to be the first rapper ever to touch a mic.\n\nHistory shows that at the <a href=\"https://www.google.ca/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=11&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0ahUKEwi0xtqHjOvLAhUKs4MKHbRnDZoQFghHMAo&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.history.com%2Fthis-day-in-history%2Fhip-hop-is-born-at-a-birthday-party-in-the-bronx&usg=AFQjCNEVpQFve97pu83LUtdheD5Il3FywQ&sig2=onse4sIKIrO6MlAqG5jWKg\">infamous 1973 party that DJ Kool Herc threw for his sister Cindy</a>, hip-hop was born, in every way possible. Herc changed the game, of course, but -- most important to this conversation -- a young (street) rapper who was then known as A1 Coke, or Coco, grabbed the mic and changed the world. Amidst playfully calling out his homies, using an echo chamber, he dropped the following:\n\n<em>\"There is not a man that can’t be thrown\nA horse that can’t be rode\nA bull that can’t be stopped\nThere is not a disco that I Coke La Rock can’t rock.\"</em>\n\nJust like that, the first rap infected the crowd and quickly spread and took on a life of its own. Coke, shortly after Kool Herc was stabbed a party some years later, walked away from rap. A move, he said at the time, was partly to let some of the younger cats have a chance at wearing the crown. Unfortunately, Coke came up in an era that pre-dates a constant documenting of experiences. Thus, we're left only with stories and beautifully preserved digital copies of 1970's and 80's party fliers.\n\nIs there a point or lesson to this? Yes. Coke La Rock often describes what he did that night as just having fun with his friends. He had no preconceived notions of fame, no desire to sign a deal -- he didn't even have rhymes written. He didn't record any records! It was improvisational, organic, and inspiring. It was, quite literally, the purest example of hip-hop ever.\n\nThe lesson is that artists need to take some time to listen to their inner voice, and find a way to materialize that into their music. Music doesn't have to be a jumble of influences outside of your experience. As well, genuine admiration for an artist doesn't have to lead directly to similar music. Stop trying so hard to fit in, and work harder at standing out. Listen to your heart -- it will tell you if you're truly in this game for the right reason. If Coke La Rock can do it, you can to!\n\nStop biting!\n\nTo learn more about Coke La Rock’s Story, check out this great video by Steve Hager. Steve Documented hip hop's birth and founded the Cannabis Cup -- amongst other things.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hqi-_g894ss",

    "content_html": "While on the hunt for a digital artist to help him design a mixtape cover, entrepreneur Lee Holloway discovered a huge niche. Many of the providers that existed in the market either used cheap looking templates or lacked the intimate knowledge to create credible urban artwork, which resulted in low-quality results. Lee, better known as the Mixtape Cover King, began offering custom, one of a kind cover, and before long things took off, in a major way. Once he had over 100 orders, he realized he needed to find a way to make this into a business that could help feed his family. In 2012, Mixtape Cover King officially launched online and has since done notable covers for the likes of the dab-gods, Migos, Mr. Never Tired, Kevin Gates, Twista, numerous Coast 2 Coast DJ's and much – much – more.\n\nWith a commercial on Vh1's signature urban series, Love & Hip-Hop, to international acclaim, Lee and his team clearly have the game on lock; although, their breadth of offerings doesn't stop at mixtapes. Take a look at the commercial/review below of the custom iced out jewellery you can have produced.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJEY2NFSxBw\n\nBottom line, if you're an indie artist, you need to put your best foot forward. Rather than suffer from lack of media due to poor graphics, why not let Lee and his team get you looking right for the summer.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.mixtapecoverking.com\">Check them out</a>!",

    "content_html": "Native Brooklynite, Jimmy Heights, is making a b-line towards the front of the new school movement taking place ion the NYC scene. After a solid listen to his first mixtape, \"Don Quixote,” and his latest mixtape, “Black AmeriKKKa,” it's clear to see he goes over and above the booty and bling, delivering sociopolitical messages to his listeners. Jimmy Heights is establishing himself at the head of the young hip hop class, and demonstrating that he’s a force to be reckoned with; get to know Jimmy, below, as he takes our world-famous AAHIPHOP Q&A\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nzHeBPSM5I\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IW9PTFvTTeU\n\n</ hr>\n\n<b>How did you get involved in hip-hop?</b>\n\nBelieve it or not, the first hip-hop song I ever heard came from Bow Wow. I just remember getting ready for school and the song played on the TV. I was probably like 5, and I was only used to soca that my parents played around in the house or Michael Jackson, who was my favorite artist at the time. Ever since that day, I followed hip hop closely. Starting off with Bow Wow and my love elevated even more after 50 Cent debuted. I was about nine at that time. He made me love the art of hip-hop.\n\n<b>Who were some of your influences?</b>\n\nI'm influenced by just about everything. Growing up my biggest influences were 50 Cent and Kanye West even though my style was pretty different from both. These days, I got a lot of Young Thug in my playlist along with plenty other of these young artists out here. I just gain influence from everyone or personal experiences. I might like the way a certain Lupe Fiasco beat sound along with the cadences of a Lil Durk hook. I listen to just about everyone’s music which in turn just betters the product I’m trying to put out.\n\n<b>Tell me about your music – what are you currently working on?</b>\n\nI’m still working on my first EP, “Skinny Dippin’ With Naked B*tches in Poland”. I have a video that I recently recorded that's supposed to drop next week called “Potent” featuring my boy Ravage Roc. I got a lot in store. I’ve been writing every day. A lot of work in the arsenal. I’d love to release a new video every month. So we’ll see what happens.\n\n<b>How would you describe your sound?</b>\n\nMy sound is refreshing, harmonic, melodic, emotional, ravishing and raw. I might be one of the few young guys that can put a hook together but also keep it “lyrical”. I try to cater to both sides of hip hop fans. The ones that like to sing along to the hooks and the fans that decipher each and every word in the verse. Songs that could be played on the radio and in the club but also could be played when your alone and going thru it or just bumping. \n\n<b>What are your goals in the industry?</b>\n\nI don’t think I would want to be an artist forever. Probably have a good successful little run as an artist. In the latter years, I want to move around behind the scenes. Work with other artists songwriting, producing and all the other good stuff. Hopefully by my 40s, I could lead a successful entertainment company.\n\n<b>What do you want people to take away from you as an artist?</b>\n\nThe works of a creative genius. I put a lot of work into my music and videos. Obviously, my budget isn’t huge for my whole idea to be put on a platter, but when I reach that platform appreciate my creativity and uniqueness. There’s not another Jimmy Heights. \n\n<b>Do you want to remain independent or sign to a major label?</b>\n\nOf course, I’d love to stay independent. With the way that the music industry is moving with all resources available to unsigned artists, it makes sense to stay independent. But if the right deal comes along that could set my family for life, it would be stupid and selfish to pass up on it.",

    "content_html": "Psycho Les and JuJu, better known to the world as the Beatnuts, are not only the only Latin members of the infamous Native Tongues Collective, they're also two of the dopest producers from the golden era. From the onset of their debut, which included such records as \"Reign Of The Tec\" and the classic \"Props Over Here,\" they established themselves as formidable voices on the NYC scene. Throughout the heyday of 90's East Coast music, they did a gang of damage behind the boards, becoming b-side kings as they remixed numerous hit records for some of the biggest names in hip-hop.\n\nThey're immortal status, though, was signed, sealed, and delivered, when they dropped the record, \"Off The Books,\" featuring Big Pun. Other certified, charted hits by the Nuts include \"No Escaping This\" featuring Greg Nice and \"Watch Out Now,\" which were club/radio mainstays. They are still active and are currently working with the Alkoholiks, with whom they've formed the super group Liknuts.\n\nPlain and simple, if you haven't explored their vast catalogue, do so.

    "content_html": "As promised, TDE is off to a stellar start to 2016; after the massive success of Kendrick's untitled unmastered, Schoolboy Q is gearing up to drop his new project. The interwebs went nuts with the release of his newest effort,\"Groovy Tony;\" however, the new song ruffled more than a few feathers.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7iJDXIOk0bg\n\nRapper and visual artist BlankFace, <a href=\"http://aboveaveragehiphop.com/blank-face-walking-through-the-jungle/\">who we've interviewed in the past</a>, and his team saw and heard some stark similarities between their movement and the style on Groovy Q joint. As BlankFace's manager explained:\n\n<i>\"We developed the concept BlankFace 3 years ago. Two years ago we introduced the concept of BlankFace to a few execs (can't give any names), and a few days ago the song Groovy Tony came out. I automatically saw similarities from the first words he spoke. The first words that came out of his mouth were \"BlankFace.\" His rap style sounds changed from what he usually does. It's more demonic and blasphemous which sounds very similar to my artist's style. Then today I got in touch with the guy who shot the video. He told me the video was shot last year which is perfect timing because we introduced the BlankFace concept about a year and a half to 2 years ago. He calls himself the no face Killah and his first original name was BlankFace Killah [sic].\"\n</i>\nUnsigned artists calling fouls amidst allegations that major artists unlawfully borrow their artistic content, or in this case simply sounding oddly similar, is nothing new; however, not all are dignified with a response. When BlankFace's management questioned Q via Instagram, he provided a lengthy response.\n\n<center>\n<a href=\"http://aboveaveragehiphop.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/img_2985.jpg\"><img src=\"http://aboveaveragehiphop.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/img_2985.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"70%\" /></a>\n<a href=\"http://aboveaveragehiphop.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/img_2984.jpg\"><img src=\"http://aboveaveragehiphop.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/img_2984.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"70%\" /></a> </center>\n\nBoth of his responses have since been removed, likely because PR stepped in. Regardless if anyone is aware of an artist, taking portions of someone's swag -- no matter how small -- without credit isn't Bueno. BlankFace, though, is no stranger to taking shots at the upper echelon, as we heard/saw on his song \"<a href=\"http://aboveaveragehiphop.com/blank-face-walking-through-the-jungle/\">Jungle</a>.\" Not one to let it slide, he promptly dropped his version of Groovy Tony. Give it a spin below. What are you thoughts on the subject? A case of a big guy stepping on the little guy?

    "content_html": "<blockquote>I work on music EVERY SINGLE DAY. Not because I have to...but because I owe music. </blockquote>\nGrind and hustle can never truly be appreciated by the general public; unless they're your day ones, they probably can't comprehend that you've been through a gang of peaks and valleys to get where you're at. Producer/DJ Supe is a great example -- from making music and rocking parties while living in his car, to a  successful run as a radio station DJ, and active figure on the concert, festival, and club scene, he's put in work.\n\nCurrently, he's hitting the streets hard promoting his new release, \"Guilty,\" a silky new tune with singer <a href=\"http://www.ayannacharlene.com/\">Ayanna Charlene</a>. We caught up with DJ Supe, who told us about the track, his influences and how he got started in the industry.\n\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/247922210&color=ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false\"></iframe>\n\n<!-- hr-->\n\n<b>How did you get started?</b>\n\nI used to listen to \"The God Emcee,\" Rakim, like all the time in elementary school! So I started rapping and getting my flows tight. My dad had an old reel to reel player, and I used to record myself over old Funkadelic records. I had to splice the tape together when it broke from hours of playing it. I got pretty good chopping them tapes together right on the beat and made my own mixtapes. Started rapping freshman year but got drawn to deejaying my senior year. My high school friends and I started a group called Flo-Magnum, and eventually Ebro called me to guest DJ when he had a radio show in my hometown Sacramento.. (peace to DJ Tone Pesci for letting me cover for him). The rest is history.\n\n<b>Production/DJ wise, who are some of your influences?</b>\n\nSome of my influences on production are DJ Premier, Dr. Dre, and The Neptunes. My DJ influences are DJ Qbert, DJ Kid Capri and DJ Jazzy Jeff (he is going to spin at my wedding one day). I like these guys because they cut and scratch, but they also know how to rock a party. They won't scratch all off beat just to show you how fast their wrist is. They do it fluidly – that's how I do it. Most importantly, I can't forget the guys around here in California that raised me, DJ Gino, DJ Racer X, Sam Starks, and DJ Tosh who gave me a lot of good advice while spinning on the air.\n\n<b>What are you currently promoting?</b>\n\nRight now I am promoting a single I produced called \"Guilty\" which is on iTunes, Google Play, Tidal, Spotify, etc. The artist who sang on the track is Ayanna Charlene, and the song is from her EP called <i>The Cut Off</i> that I wholly produced due out later this year. I am also working closely with artists to showcase their videos on my #DJSupeQuickMix series. They are 15-minute music video mixes that you can find on my <a href=\"http://www.djsupe.net\">website</a>. They are also available on my app DJ Supe Mobile, which is on The App Store for iOS and Google Play for Android devices. Look for a few artists I am producing for on my EP called <i>Weirdo</i> due out Fall 2016; Tanjanae, Pacific Sunrise, Ruben Eaton, Carla Lawrence, and Genesis.\n\n<b>How would you describe your production?</b>\n\nMy music is a fusion of modern Hip-Hop drums, Trip Hop, and downtempo ambient sounds. I combine that with R&B/Soul chords and instruments like Rhodes and organs to create a darker but still melodic flow. Singers love it; rap artists that like to experiment with me find the groove, too.\n\n<b>What are your goals in the industry?</b>\n\nMy goals are to make a living at what I do. It's not about getting rich. It's about establishing a legacy. I love to spin records, but I also love to spin my records! So I guess deejaying is the foundation. Been doing a few concerts with Bombay VIP, which is the direction I want to go...more festivals and concerts. Want to keep that going while I continue to develop artists under my production. Having a hot single doesn't hurt either!\n\n<b>What do you want people to take away from you as a producer?</b>\n\nMy tenacious work ethic is what I want people to recognize me for. I work on music EVERY SINGLE DAY. Not because I have to...but because I owe music. I used to be homeless living in my car and making music and rocking parties AT THE SAME DAMN TIME! That was the only thing that kept me going. That is how I fed myself, so I am going to feed it back. Give and take you know?",

    "content_html": "Female hip-hop artists have – arguably – had a much harder time commanding the respect they deserve in hip-hop. It’s no fault of their own, but rather that of the old boys club structure that, although accommodating, was somewhat slanted towards male counterparts. Indeed, it’s impossible not to argue that the golden era of hip-hop only had a small handful of notable female voices. Names like Queen Latifah, Monie Love, Salt-N-Pepa, and Mc Lyte all saw success in the early 90’s. However, as hip-hop grew, [some] female rappers started to become less artistic, and more strategic (marketing wise).\n\nAlthough still solid pillars of the culture, they relied on sexuality (and behind the scenes influence) to stand out as the prominent female member of their click — as if merely being a woman wasn’t enough. Not all artists prescribed to this recipe, though. One notable name that went against the grain was Bahamadia, straight out of the city of brotherly love, which has a long history of churning out successful hip-hop figures.\n\nDiscovered by the late Guru, Bahamadia was an MC in the purest form -- all bars, and doing what she was born to do. She’s not a female MC; she’s an MC, period. Her classic album, Kollage, which featured production credits from the likes of DJ Premier and Erick Sermon (amongst others), is celebrating 20 years this month — and it holds up. We recently spoke with Bahamadia, who shared some background on her classic debut, lessons learned from Guru and more. Check out the interview below.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIxNPJqKGS4\n \n<strong>So, you were part of the Gang Starr foundation, right?\n</strong>\nYeah, I was under Guru's Tutelage...\n\n<strong>Okay, so that’s interesting. You're under Guru’s tutelage. How did he guide you, or how did he help influence Kollage? How’d you connect with him?</strong>\n\nWell, I had a [regional] hit out in ’93 called Funk Vibe that me and another producer out here at the time, named DJ Randy, who was one of the leading DJs on Philadelphia commercial radio. Through a friend, I found out he was searching for a female vocalist at the time. He reached out over the phone, I got with him, and the next thing you know I'm in the studio. Funk Vibe was released on a label called IQ Records and began to chart. From there, the who’s who of people, names like Dr. Dre, were all interested in signing me -- based on this one single.\n\nIt just happened that a friend of my sister was dating Guru at the time. I found out about it, and got this friend to take a tape to the girl; she passed it along -- and he liked it. I was already a fan of Gang Starr and felt that would be the best fit for me at the time. The rest has been what it has been.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kYrEl5gHiS0\n \n<strong>What was the process like, putting together Kollage?</strong>\n\nYou know people go in the studio, and they do songs for an album, and they might do 50 to 100 songs. They pick the best out and narrow it down to what will be considered for the project. Well, every song I did for Kollage, I never had any surplus material, so everything that I did went on the record. Guru and I got in the studio and recorded, and I thought that was going to be a batch of songs, but the next thing I know it had led to a video and all this kind of stuff. It snowballed into touring with the Fugees and… you know, so that’s how that happened.\n\nI felt like I was at home when I met Premier and everybody that was in the studio -- we just gelled, and it unfolded on its own. You know how sometimes you may be a part of something and, in hindsight, it wound up being something monumental?\n\n<strong>You know, I think every great thing that ever happened to someone was like that. I don’t think people ever stop and say, hmm, this is monumental! </strong>\n\nI've been in a dream state ever since l started professionally, honestly. Haha. It’s crazy. And you never, like, you're never not famous to somebody -- you think you're under the radar for years, somebody at the supermarket, somebody at the airport, somebody's on you, like \"Yo!\"\n\n<strong>Absolutely. And you had a lot of features too like you popped up on a lot of records randomly. The first time I heard you as an artist was the record \"Ladies in the House.\"</strong>\n\nThat was real dope. It was dope. That was a fun record. I experienced first hand in the early days that a lot of stuff used to be staged -- it was all political, like marketing you know? Strategies and things like that; but, all my stuff ended up being organic. I only work with people that I have a connection with, and I'm natural with, you know, so, that’s the way I approach my music [even today].\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiseew6ead8\n \nI don’t create unless I'm inspired by something. I'm disciplined to write and create on the spot, but, I prefer to do it organically, you know? Because that makes it art, to me.\n\n<strong>Did you find any pressure around that? In you early days, a lot of female MCs were using their sexuality to sell records. Did you have any label pressure to keep up?</strong>\n\nFirst of all, I don’t consider myself to be a female MC. I'm an artist number one. Secondly, I don’t feel pressure about something I was built to do. I didn't have any restraints and was afforded the luxury of navigating my path regarding what I do, and who I collaborate with. When it comes to me feeling pressured about something that I was born to do—no.\n\nNever pressure, because I don’t measure my performance by any standards except for the one I’ve been given, but that’s the way I look at things.\n<strong>\nI love that, because female MCs became such a focal point in rap crews, and it just got...I was like they wanted people to be hyper-aware that they were women. I never felt that about you. You were just a lyricist. </strong>\n\nMy approach had never been that because when I came out, I mean of course you knew I was a woman -- and you can look at me when I show up and know that I'm African-American, too.\n\n<strong>Yeah, haha!</strong>\n\nLet’s get down to the bottom line which is the talent, the art, and the message in the music. I'm not even concerned about reaching a target audience, just reaching people that get what I'm doing, and that gravitate towards what I do. That's the way it is for me. I mean the female thing, though, I guess that’s a business in music. That’s not the culture in hip hop. I'm an organic, authentic hip-hopper so…\n\n<strong>Absolutely. I mean that era was right on the cusp, you know what I'm saying? Hip-hop got bigger and reached extreme heights, so business took over.</strong>\n\nEverything was still developing at that time. When I came on as a solo artist, a solo female, I didn’t even know that the majority of women that were in the music industry at that time, especially from the traditional hip-hop standpoint, didn’t pen lyrics. I thought that everybody wrote their lyrics ... all the men did their lyrics, all the women did their lyrics. You know, I didn’t know that. When I realized it was structured as a business like R&B and all the other genres, I was like wow, okay.\n\nSo that being said, I didn’t have any influence because Guru and them, they gave me knowledge regarding the business I was doing and taught me not to compromise my art. He taught me things like not letting anybody put a time restraint on when I should put music out. He told me all that stuff about publishing; making sure my publishing was straight. All those things.\n\nJust being afforded the opportunity to express me in an organic place is just… I don’t have a lot of words for it. A lot of women were used as a novelty in this game; you know what I mean? A majority of them had men behind them, and they were using them just to articulate a vision or an idea or concept they had [as men], having them express themselves the way they think women 'should' express themselves. My experience came from a different place—I was talking about parenting, a lot of different things that was like...people weren’t really in touch with those topics at that time. And again, that was just me doing me; art is an expression of life -- and I feel like that’s why I was just talking about the things that I know from my heart, you know? So that’s how that happened.\n\n<strong>So what are you working on now?\n</strong>\nI'm into app development a little bit, and I have a series that I do strictly on my phone. As well, the 20-year anniversary thing is coming up; and [at the universal hip hop museum] we’re having our first event celebrating women’s contribution to hip hop, in the industry, and in the culture. That's starting June 3rd.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxiZMfEeh-c\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyGUesyG7bU\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F63qual4lzk",

    "content_html": "Surprise albums have become a the staple marketing strategy of the past 365, which has been quite exciting -- for the most part. The latest out of nowhere release came this week from legendary Compton OG, DJ Quik, and buzzing CPT native Problem with their joint EP, Rosecrans. The name is a nod to Rosecrans Avenue, the main street that runs through several cities including Compton and Hawthorne in south Los Angeles County. \n\nMuch like the infamous street, the project's lead song, \"A New Nite/ Rosecrans Grove,\" is long and varied, clocking in at just over 9 minutes in length. It features thick, west coast production you've come to appreciate from Quik over the years, with a host of video-game inspired elements infused. The track, which was my highlight of the EP -- BTW -- almost comes off as a jam session instrumentally. Lyrically, both artists give exactly what you'd expect; no surprises, but no disappointments, either. The Game, Wiz Khalifa, Candice Boyd and more appear throughout the concise six-song effort delivering strong bars. \n\nThis is top down, real-deal, summertime west coast hip-hop, coming from one of the most respected rappers in the history of the city. From his 15-year on wax beef with MC Eiht to his work with the West's upper echelon, Quik has never really put out anything that wasn't solid -- in my humble opinion. And if you haven't been following the upward trajectory of rapper Problem, it's not too late to get on the train. These two rappers gel so well together that's hard to imagine we won't hear more from them as a duo. Give Rosecrans a spin; it gets two W's up.\n\nEarly. \n\nhttps://youtu.be/02LzLA8B9j0",

    "content_html": "A lot has changed in the three years since the hood pope last left us with a collection of songs to knock. For one, the A$AP team lost their rock, Yams, who died of a drug overdose in January of 2015. Secondly, he’s gone back to his [fashion] roots in a major way, teaming up with Adidas to produce signature sneakers and gear; however, Ferg could only keep his day one fans waiting for so long. With a significant buzz that began with the single/video \"Next Level\" featuring Future, his latest album <em>Always Strive & Prosper</em> is here – and it’s full of surprises.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Srns7NiO278\n\nAs a self-identified Ferg fan, the album has an unexpected aura to it. Unlike his <i>Trap Lord</i> LP, <i>AS&P</i> is much more introspective and personal. He walks us through his past, gives us a look at his family, speaks openly about his relationship, and pays respect to his fallen comrade. He sets the tone for the album on the second song – and first leak – “Hungry Ham,” a reference to his  OG stomping grounds of Hamilton Heights. The Skrillex produced banger sees Ferg opening himself up and speaking on finite personal anecdotes, like his mother’s reaction to him dropping everything to rap. He talks more about his family on the [two-part] “Psycho,\" where he breaks down his relationship with his gangster uncle, and the influence it had on him; the story continues seamlessly with the song “Let It Bang,’ featuring Schoolboy Q.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2foQwkKQgc\n\nThe surprises on this album, though, are his professions of love on “Let You Go,” and – the damn-near marriage proposal – “I Love You.” As well, his pro-positivity techno-infused dose of reality, \"Strive\" (featuring Missy), is bound to the song of the summer. He also drops a very gentle/surface call to [#blacklivesmatter] action on “Beautiful People,\" and pays proper tribute to Yams on “Yammer Style,” which ends with (Yam’s) mother proclaiming that they are keeping his legacy alive.\n\nAfter three solid listens to the 18 song effort, I feel as though I’m more into Ferg as a person; he gives listeners a chance to get to understand him a bit more clearly. From fashion to rap, Ferg is ahead of the curve. <em>Always Strive & Prosper</em> is a fantastic notch under his belt and a perfect start to the warm season. Give it a bunch of spins!\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUhPM6PyzLo\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4Co_H50hUw",

The Brooklyn-native has earned himself some competitive accolades and high-profile performances over the years; in fact, his talents have been in demand on the club scene since he was only 12, leading to sets in Miami, various legendary New York City nightclubs (Marquee, Cielo, and Pacha), and an East Coast college tour. He's the Dougie Howser of the DJ game!\n\nNow, after two decades in the game, John has done everything but slow down. From rocking private events and charity functions to producing progressive house and hip-hop remixes, he's continuing to grow his brand in a major way. We recently took some time out to chat with John about his career, his influences, and so much more. Check the interview below.\n\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/190507957&color=ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false\"></iframe>\n\n<b>How did you get involved in DJ'ing?</b>\n\nIt kinda started by accident; I was curious about radio sounds and\nmessing around with equipment in the house. Got my first Turntable at 9, started doing College parties for my sister around 12. From there I knew I wanted to keep going… I liked it too much, and I never looked back.\n\n<b>Who are some of your influences?</b>\n\nDJ Kool Herc! A significant influence for doing what he did [helping build the genre]. Most DJ’s and Artist forget about that. DJ AM has been a huge influence on me growing up; I loved his musical range and creativity. DJ Riz DJ Sizzahandz -- The Crooklyn Clan. I have a lot of respect and admiration for the pioneers of the game who elevated the craft.\n\n<b>Describe yourself as a DJ -- what's your sound? What do you love to spin?</b>\n\nI pride myself as an open format DJ, so my sound is high-energy and all over the place. Depending on the night and crowd, I’m doing anything from Hip-hop/R&B and dancehall reggae to tribal house, Dance - Trap, reggaeton or bachata; I even hit the crowd with some slow jams this past weekend! And they LOVED IT!\n\n<b>Do you create your own music?</b>\n\nYeah, I make my music, but I wouldn’t consider myself a producer at this point. My primary focus is on getting better with my technical DJ skills and finding new creative ways to get the crowd moving. I'm a DJ 1st!\n\n<b>What makes you unique as a DJ?</b>\n\nMy energy for sure; I try to develop a relationship with the crowd every night, so they stay connected Battle/party rock hybrid.\n\n<b>What are some of you fave venues you've performed at?</b>\n\nI’ve had some great experiences playing at Marquee, Cielo, and Pacha in particular. Some of my other favorite spots are Studio Square, Public House, and Lexicon. For me it's all about the vibe you create in a room.\n\n<b>Tell me a story of your wildest gig.</b>\n\nA little while ago I did a set at Studio Square with “Quiet Events.\" There was something about the crowd and their energy that night, very different in all my years. I’ve never had a room like this; from girls rushing and twerking on the stage to girls jumping on the stage to dance with me. The crowd was screaming the words to songs back at me like I’ve never seen -- it was dope.\n\n<b>What is your fave track of 2016 thus far?</b>\n\n\"Promise,\" by  Kid Ink ft. Fetty Wap. The vibe is everything on this record, and I appreciate the message they put forward in the video.\n\n<b>Any last word for the blog?</b>\n\nI’m just incredibly humbled by the experience so far. It’s been a wild ride, and I’m grateful to be on it. 2016 has been my best year so far, and I’m very excited for more big things. Big shout out to my sponsors Pamplona Unltd, Quiet Events, Onfyre  Managment, and Big Shout to all my Supporters!\n\nhttp://youtu.be/whgMX028zwI",

    "content_html": "Not to sound all DJ Khaled-ish, but the keys to success in the rap game are a combination of both quality and consistency. With over a decade of solid bars under his belt, Sacramento/San Diego's rapper and CEO, Smigg Dirtee, walks the line -- and he has the war stories and strong fan base to prove it. His latest project, <em>#Dirtee</em>, is a little bit of everything; but it all adds up to a balanced plate sure to satisfy even the hungriest hip-hop head.\n\nThe album kicks off with a flip of the EPMD classic, \"Please Listen to My Demo,\" where Smigg asserts his lyrical dominance and prepares listeners for the journey ahead; but that's just the appetizer. It's the second track, though where things get started. It's within the first 16 bars where he drops probably the most telling bars of the album: \"Intelligent hood life -- I'm like Chief Keef and Lupe.\" This sentiment stayed in my head for the bulk of the audio experience. He traverses the rawest manifestation of street life on the dope boy anthem \"Drug Dealer Paranoia,\" flashes his certified mack card on the self-titled \"Dirtee,\" and lives up a Chief Keef level of trapness on \"IDGAF\" and \"Stupid Loud.\" There is also a healthy dose of introspective, down to earth music here, though, like \"Special,\" where he pays homage to those often left out of 'thank you' tracks, like his step-father, and his friend who -- after a string of tragedies -- turned to drugs. A stand-out for me was \"2 Different Worlds,\" a modern day Romeo & Juliet-esque story of a love affair with a girl from a more well-off background.\n\nhttp://youtu.be/ApQhh4ajrt0\n\nThe album closer, \"Bout This Life,\" is the real gem here, as he confidently drops braggadocious raps, while sharing nuggets about himself: \"I've been through too much shit to swag rap.\" As a listener, that's what makes Smigg so relatable, because I've [also] been through too much shit to <i>listen</i> to swag rap that dominates the airwaves. <em>#Dirtee </em>is, at points, intelligent and ignorant -- see? Chief Keef and Lupe. It's a well-balanced project that gives listeners glimpses into the ups and downs of an artist who's been doing this since the 90s era. A must-listen, in my humble opinion.\n\nEarly.\n\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"450\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/playlists/8171304&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true\"></iframe>",

    "content_html": "<blockquote>\"Tryin' to buy my mom a crib and until then -- can't even sleep at night.\"\n-- Kidd Napp</blockquote>\nRapper Kidd Napp may have been born in Los Angeles, CA. But the city of Jackson, MS, helped mold him, along with the struggle his mother, raising five children alone. It was during a deployment in Afghanistan when he made the decision to pursue music as a career. One night, while outside of their living area, he was listening to one the tracks he recorded when his fellow soldier, Tre (K-Sino) Baity, asked who was he listening to. After he had told him it is him, they were both became locked in with one common goal as they headed back state side to Savannah, GA. Shortly after pushing out a few songs recorded in a local studio, Napp received an email from the Brown Sugar Festival Committee, asking if he could perform at the festival in May 2016. Napp started production on his first project <em>Under Construction</em>, and released it this past March. \"Long Day\" is the most recent song -- and believe me, it's worth a few listens.\n\nWhen I first popped in his full-length release, Under Construction, is a little of everything; there is a blend of melodic mid-west swag, backpack rap, and even bass-filled contemporary trap sound. All that to say, though, the project is super cohesive, and nothing feels out of place. From the hunger bars of \"Kill 'Em Slow,\" the slow/sexy vibe of \"Come Over,\" to the declaration of his determination on the west coast vibed Count Me Out. \"They count me down, but can't count me out,\" is the overarching theme that seems to drive this album. He started at the bottom, and the sacrifices and grind it took to bring him to this project (literally a lifetime worth) all seem to have shaped his sound. That isn't that common these days -- this is real life music.\n\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/248235730&color=ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false\"></iframe>\n\nStandouts here are \"Some Trouble,\" a track dedicated to an unnamed female -- featuring singer Maskerade -- and the album's outro, \"Life.\" \"I take my pen and write my story to life -- although I stumble, I scratch an error and write till it's right,\" Napp proclaims confidently on the knocking beat.   \n\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https://api.soundcloud.com/tracks/227632638&color=ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false\"></iframe>\n\nHis latest release, the single \"Long Day,\" is more of the same positive professions of hard work that pays off -- in a good way. The song is a reference to more than just a day, really; long day refers to the years he's put into this. The song makes references to his desire to help out his mother and his time in Afghanistan (as he contemplated his chosen career path). It's super lyrical and deeply personal.\n\nHis openness as an artist is what will ultimately take him to where he wants to be. To like and relate to his music, is to like and relate directly to him, as he's put so much of himself into it. It's well-produced, and curated. Kidd Napp is definitely an artist to add to your playlist this week!\n\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"450\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/257723993&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true\"></iframe>",

They have the type of sound and imagery that gives writers like me what can only be described as a \"writer boner.\" Self-professed semi-conscious hip hop, you can feel the aura of these cats, and can pretty much deduce it's only a matter of time. Their latest song/video, \"Rake Cat,\" is dark, lyrical, and fun to watch. In case you missed it, their previous video \"Scopolamine\" had over 100-thousand hits on Youtube.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWjYAOKj8JA\n\nAfter you're done with the latest from Dead Rep, you'll want to check out NXUS' latest EP, the six-track <em>Bando Music The Tales Of Peter Pyraxx</em>. \"Recycle Raps,\" and \"Foreign,\" should find their way on to your playlist this week.

    "content_html": "We've featured rapper MPYRE here on AAHIPHOP in the past -- here's a refresher. This time around, though, I sat with his full mixtape, <em>TWO-STOCK</em>. Let me back up, I'm getting too excited. MPYRE is a Philapino rapper who hails from Chicago, which is arguable one of the most eclectic musical melting pots anywhere. Ground zero for some of the most groundbreaking jazz music ever, drill music, and conscious hip-hop from the likes of Common and Lupe, artists emerging from the street of Chi-town could go many ways. MPYRE is bringing a very jazzy, mid-western hip-hop vibe that at a time takes me back to early days of Kanye on the ROC (aesthetically). <em>TWO STOCK</em> is eight tracks long -- very concise, well paced, and well organized.\n\nNow the goods. He covers a broad range of topics and directions, from police violence, terrible luck with relationships, some good old fashioned macking, depression, and more. The soulful hooks by Becca Brown on tracks like [one of my faves], \"Rosetta Stone\" -- probably one of the more unique 'trying to holla at a girl' concepts I've heard in a while -- is perfect. She also kills the vibed out \"Chiberia,\" where MPYRE calls out Chicago politicians and references Laquan MacDonald's murder while simultaneously airing frustrations over the state of \"Chiraq,\" and the cities chilly climate. \n\nAnother huge record and big look for the rapper is the mixtapes closer, \"Step By Step,\" which features Saba, whom Some of you may have heard on Chance The Rapper's \"Angels.\" \n\nThe album is well-arranged and flows like a lake. The vibe feels like it would translate well into a live performance with a live band and horn section. It's personal, real, and just a good clean listen to free-of filler. For a debut mixtape, it shows a ton of promise. MPYRE is another artist we're putting on our official watch-list. If anymore talent falls on our laps, we'll have to open an office out there!\n\nBe sure to add <em>TWO STOCK</em> to your playlist this weekend.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cy6E2F5VLcY\n\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"450\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/playlists/209631295&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true\"></iframe>",

    "content_html": "<blockquote>I keep asking myself, how did I break through the competition, and make it right through to the top?\n\n— Menace</blockquote>\nSome producers work their whole lives hoping to reach their opus; their signature beat that puts them in the history books alongside the production elite. Pete Rock’s opus will always be the iconic \"T.R.O.Y.,\" for example. Some younger producers, like RunWay Star and Young Chop, who produced \"Teach Me How to Dougie,” and Chief Keef’s seminal hit “Don’t Like,” respectively, have been lucky enough to sit behind huge, culture shifting records that have helped to propel their careers. It would be impossible to argue, though, that young Menace (a 22-year-old from Birmingham, UK) hasn’t bested them all. In fact, he’s dramatically shifted the sound of 2016 and produced one of the biggest records in years. He has over a decade of production under his belt, and his Youtube/Instagram accounts give us a look into his all-in, relentless production regime. It wasn’t until he sold the beat “Panda” to a US rapper named Desiigner for $200, that both their lives changed — forever. From hitting over 121 million plays on You-Tube, to being used by Yeezy on his critically acclaimed <em>Life Of Pablo</em>, the song is literally everywhere.\n\n“Panda\" just recently reached platinum status, which is mind blowing if you consider it didn’t even have an official video until this week. Menace’s stroke of luck has put him in a position to not only work with names like Lil’ Wayne but also led to him signing a lucrative production deal with Stellar Songs. The US-based company has collaborated with artists ranging from Beyonce, Katy Perry, Rihanna, and Ne-Yo to Michael Jackson, Mary J Blige and Elton John [no big deal]. He also, until recently, had a part-time job. He’s now working full-time on his music, and shopping for a new crib — crazy.\n\nMenace was recently kind enough to chat with me about how his life has changed, how he connected with Desiigner, and more. He’s a super humble kid -- it'll be amazing to see where he goes from here.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsJLLEwUYZM\n\n<strong>Tell us a little more about yourself.</strong>\n\nI’m from the UK obviously, Manchester. I started producing beats at the age of 12; I’m 22 now, so I've been at it for ten years. I used to have a part-time job before all of this happened. I’m now proudly doing music full-time, since signing a production deal with Stellar Songs.\n\n<strong>How did you originally get in contact with </strong>Desiigner<strong>?</strong>\n\nSomeone in his circle bought the beat. I used to have a beat store up. Maybe a month after he bought it, he hit me up on Twitter, and was like, \"you need to check this out, this is fire.\" Everyone was saying it had potential [in the comments], but when I heard it, I knew it was going to be huge.\n\n<strong>What was your reaction to the (almost) overnight popularity of the song?</strong>\n\nI didn't even really understand how it just blew up all of a sudden, which obviously is a good thing. But, it just felt like one day it was uploaded, and the next it exploded.\n\n<strong>There has been an ungodly amount of remixes to the song. What has been your favourite so far?</strong>\n\nRight now, I would say T-Pain; he just incorporated so many different musical elements into it. I mean, of course, there's been some great remixes, like Meek Mill, and Lil'Kim, but I give T-Pain that respect. He destroyed Panda. Desiigner made the song what it is, but I think if the original was T-Pain, the song might have done just as well.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1385O4D-gC0\n\n<strong>Have you had any artists reach out to you since the track exploded?</strong>\n\nRight now I'm working with Lil'Wayne, French Montana, and Partynextdoor -- so lots of projects on the go.\n\n<strong>Are they all asking for a “Panda” type beat? [laughs]</strong>\n\nExactly, they heard the production, and everyone wants the Panda type beat now. That's the new sound of 2016. Well, I hope it is. That's what I've been sending them. Wayne and French Montana are quite versatile, though.\n\n<strong>How has your personal life changed — are you still at home?</strong>\n\nYeah, I'm still living with my family right now -- but, I'm looking for a new home. It's crazy the opportunities that are popping up.\n\n<strong>It is mind bending to go from living with your family to even consider purchasing property in the UK at the age of 22...</strong>\n\nIt's all about using the opportunity. It's like a disease, to be honest. In a good way. It just kind of spread everywhere and took over. If it kept spreading, we'd probably see endless remixes.\n\n<strong>It’s interesting to think, though, that Desiigner is going through the same thing right now!</strong>\n\nWe both started from the bottom -- and now we're here.\n\n<strong>Have you two met in person?</strong>\n\nWe haven't -- we've been in contact, though, and we're planning to get together soon. We're planning on working on another project shortly.\n\n<strong>How wild is that? You two have this weird bond now...</strong>\n\nWe do.  It's hard to process because, first of all, it was fast -- lightening fast. I didn't expect that I'd be sitting behind the biggest single of 2016. Just luck I guess, or maybe I was destined for greatness. It’s kind of like DJ Mustard. Everyone started hearing his stuff, and were like \"I want that, I want that.\" That's kind of what happened to me, just on a much bigger scale.\n\n<strong>It is; I mean, some producers will (and have) worked their whole lives, and will never have a song as culturally relevant as \"Panda.\"</strong>\n\nI keep asking myself, how did I break through the competition, and make it right through to the top?\n\n<strong>Do you remember making “Panda?\" What was going through your head?</strong>\n\nTo be honest, somebody commented on my Instagram video, where I was in the process of making the beat -- I was in the process of making \"Panda.\" That was 2014. I forget I had even made that video. I knew I had something special, though.\n\n<strong>What do you think is the biggest thing producers do wrong?</strong>\n\nThey make music, but don't know how to market music. They don't know -- or consider -- the age group and demographic the beat is for. They just make beats and hope people hop on it.\n\n<strong>So where do you go from here?</strong>\n\nThe next singles I'm working on are going to be even bigger than “Panda\" -- that's what I'm hoping. I have to see this as a stepping stone. Keep the momentum up and carry on. Let's see what 2016 has in store for me. I'm looking forward to it.",

    "content_html": "Full disclosure, I'm over three decades old. I'm a father of two young children, and I've been immersed and plugged into hip-hop culture since the early 90s. So, like most older heads, sometimes the newer generations [there's been a few now] of artists make me feel old. One such movement was led by the based god, Lil' B. I didn't get it. I gave it repeated attempts, but couldn't grasp the appeal; however his sheer cult status intrigued me, and I eventually wrapped my mind around the direction that he and the artists affiliated with him were going. One young producer, along the same vein, is SlurRty. I've had his name pop up a few times in conversations, which prompted me to delve in. Why is he notable? Well, off the top, he's produced for the based god, as well as Tyga's artist, Honey Cocaine, Love and Hip Hop Hollywood star Soulja Boy, and much more. So, as far as production is concerned, he has a pretty solid resume.\n\nAs an artist, he comes off a little more polished than some of the artists's he's produced for -- personally. His music is often slow, hypnotic, and full of distorted, varied style. But he also shakes shit up. For example, you think you have him pinned when listening to his last record \"Baddest Bitch I Ever Seen,\" but the he drops jazzy boom-bap hip-hop on \"After Party.\" He's quite eclectic. Kind of like a new-age Kool Keith. He doesn't seem to prescribe to a standard and does so consistently. Not unlike Lil'B; when I previously said that I suddenly understood the movement, it was Lil'B's consistency. SluRty's music takes some risks -- that's his constant. He has a youthful vibe.\n\nTake a listen to his latest joint, \"Time,\" fresh out of the studio. You'll also want to go through his production catalog.\n\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"450\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/264282742&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true\"></iframe>",

    "content_html": "In their latest <a href=\"https://youtu.be/TZZB2gDYlkk\">Great Hip-Hop Debates</a> podcast, XXL's EIC Vanessa Satten, Jack Thriller, Dj Suss One, and Torae, debated whether younger heads needed to be schooled on the history of the culture. It was mostly in direct response to a recent controversy surrounding a tweet referring to Nas as Esco, which young-Twitter immediately jumped all over, accusing XXL of making an error [infuriating older heads in the process]. One of the great takeaways, though, was that we need to take the initiative to teach younger generations about the history of the culture, when at all possible.\n\nWell, today is the 18th anniversary of DMX's debut album, <i>It's Dark and He'll Is Hot</i>, and rather than merely pointing it out, I felt it necessary to be part of the solution and discuss why the album matters. Today DMX is a shell of his former self; unfortunately, most 90's babies missed D in his heyday, so they may not understand why he gets a consecutive pass from the hip-hop community.\n\nAllow me to break it down.\n\nBy the time May, 1998, rolled around, buzz for DMX’s impending full-length album was at a fever-pitch. He’d made some serious noise dropping 16’s on some massive records the year before, namely Ma$e’s Debut album, <i>Harlem World</i>, LOX’s debut, <i>Money Power Respect</i>. Not to mention, his verse on LL Cool J’s \"1,2,3,4\" — the song that started the beef between Canibus and LL [more on that another time]. So, when It’s Dark and Hell Is Hot hit the streets, hot on the heels of the single, Get At Me Dog, people lost their minds. What Jeezy had (regarding an aura of authenticity) when he first dropped, X had in overabundance. He was a hyper example of NYC’s gritty streets, circa the early 90s (think Onyx Bacdafucup) mixed with this inexplicable [because I'm a guy] appeal that had females open. The record was a product of the good old days of Def Jam, when über meticulous attention was paid to creating full bodies of work. The album was personal, aggressive, insightful, and catchy. Records like Ruff Ryder’s Anthem and Get At Me Dog become anthems in the big apple, and nationwide.\n\nRecords that have always stuck out to me were \"How’s It Goin’ Down\", a record that sees D essentially letting go of a relationship with a married/taken woman, and \"Damian,\" where D sells his soul to the devil in exchange for success — a storyline he picked up on subsequent albums.\n\nThe album sold over 200k in its first week, and two years later, was certified 4x platinum. A mere seven months later (within the same calendar year), he released his follow-up album, which also reached 4x platinum status. He became the first rap artist to have two number-one albums within one calendar year. It may be younger heads to grasp how large DMX was, but numbers don't lie. And those numbers are reductions. He helped usher in names like Eve, Swizz Beats, and a host of others; and, was an inspiration to countless artists. I'm not even going to get into Belly, and his other movie roles, or his other albums. But, DMX's place in (hip-hop) history is well deserved.\n\nHe still packs shows, though, and as of late, seems to be on a more positive path. It's been well publicized that his issues with drugs and alcohol have been a dark cloud over his career -- and more importantly his life -- for a better part of the last decade.\n\nListening to this album as I write, 18 years after first pumping it in my blue Sony Walkman during the summer of 1998, takes me right back to that time in my life. It's true that much of the love D still gets is due to the nostalgic value of his classic catalog; however, the album is timeless. It more than holds up -- and stacks up -- today, just as well as it did when it first dropped. I still get the same feeling as I listen \"How It's Goin' Down,\" reminiscing about an era that seems like yesterday, but is a lifetime ago.\n\nIf you've never indulged, give the album a spin. If you're a real head, re-indulge. All hail the Dark Man.\n\n[Dark Bark] ... What the deal?\n\nhttps://youtu.be/H1iuokGmZTU\n\nhttps://youtu.be/v-J_BuumkuU\n\nhttps://youtu.be/ThlhSnRk21E\n\nhttps://youtu.be/P5L1WtHwJF0\n\nhttps://youtu.be/4AognXgM9FQ",

    "content_html": "<blockquote>\"Never did it for the business it was all sport, still my greatest fea is taht I fall short.\"\n\n--Jamon</blockquote>\nLooking for a dope addition to your weekend movements? Look no further than Samoan rapper Jamon – a San Diego, California, native. Originally 1/3 of Da Block, he started his career back in late 2011 when the trio released their first mixtape, <em><a href=\"https://noisetrade.com/dablock/the-ride-home\">The Ride Home</a></em>, which was highly praised on DatPiff.com; it was categorized in their top three mixtapes for the latter portion of that year. Since then, the guys have been on the road, performing with heavyweights like The Game, DJ Quik, YG, Big Sean, Cataracs, Kid Ink, Suga Free, Faith Evans, Mann, Mickey Avalon, Travis Porter, El Debarge, Warren G, and much more. A handful of their mixtape singles also received radio spins around the world.\n\nJamon has more recently stepped out on his own, with the release of his newest mixtape, <em>Afakasi Raps</em> — a 13 song mixtape full of quality production, eclectic vibes, and real depth. He delivers that west coast vibe on the track “Soulville,” a radio-ready reggae vibe on “Day Fade” and “Talk To Ya,” and deeply personal (emotional) bars on “Family,” and the stand-out track, “Letters.” There are guest vocals from Joe Budden collaborator Emanny, and Universal/Motown artist Pac Div.\n\nWe heard a rumor that Jamon recently turned down a couple of indie record deals; it’s likely that he can feel the bigger and better things on the horizon. We can certainly hear it!\n\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"450\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/playlists/220352190&color=ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false\"></iframe>",

    "content_html": "<blockquote>\"I’m not an Instagram model; It’s hard when people want to put you in one box and keep you there.”\n\n—Shelah Marie</blockquote>\nMaybe it’s because I’m a father of two wonderful daughters, but I find myself relating verbatim to Nas’s “Daughters.” Whenever I see women being negatively or unfairly portrayed in the media in any way, I see my daughters, and my heart breaks a little. This was the case when I started seeing the [extremely surface] fashion in which some outlets were shining light on Ace Hood’s girlfriend, the lovely Shelah Marie. She’s a yoga loving, theater performer that’s easy on the eyes — no question. But she’s also a well educated, articulate, and creative soul, who’s used theater as a philanthropic tool to create positive change in the world. Definitely, more than just \"Ace’s Bae.\"\n\nI decided to reach out to Shelah and learn a little more about her background in the arts, her work, and her relationship.\n\nCheck out the interview below.\n\n<style>.embed-container { position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; } .embed-container iframe, .embed-container object, .embed-container embed { position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; }</style>\n<div class=\"embed-container\"><iframe src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/147909369\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"\" mozallowfullscreen=\"\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe></div>\n\n<hr>\n\n<strong>Tell me a little bit about yourself.\n</strong>\nI'm an actress, a playwright, and a meditation enthusiast. I focus on self-love in no matter what avenue I’m using. Right now I’m focusing on planning the #curvyandcurly conscious tour for summer 2017.\n\n<strong>Maybe tell me a little bit about that [#curvyandcurly]. How did it come together?\n</strong>\nWell, It began when I was just starting to get (Instagram) followers beyond people that I already knew. I was like, \"What -- people that don’t know me want to follow me, why?\" You know, so I started to think, \"Okay, I should make a hashtag that resonates with me so that everything can be in one place.\" I just thought of something that was true for me; I was curvy and curly, and that’s how the hashtag started. I began to notice that it seemed to draw people in. Women appeared to be drawn to it as a support system for body love, and men were drawn to it because -- well -- they love curly and curvy women. I mean, mean who doesn’t?\n\n<strong>Something that is interesting about you [that seems overlooked] is that you’re insanely well educated -- and you’re deep in the theater community. How did you get involved in theater?\n</strong>\nI started acting when I was in high school. At that time, l worked at TGIF Fridays. This agent came for lunch there one day, and she saw me and she was like, \"You should be modeling.\" Long story short, she became my first manager, and I started booking every single thing I went on an audition for. I didn’t have any training at that point, and decided I wanted to hone this tool and make it work for me. So I have a bachelors degree in theater from Florida University, and I also have a master's in performance studies from Tisch School of the Arts at NYU. With that education I transitioned into teaching artists training, which means I'm an artist first, an educator second. So I use the skills that I learned from the theater – from acting to developing other skills – with people both in school and outside of school.\n\nI’ve also written and produced plays that have traveled throughout the country. I’ve performed on TV; I’ve performed on film, and in many theaters in New York City. So acting is something that I love to do, and I’m looking forward to manifesting that more here in South Florida which is like a whole new world to me.\n\n<strong>Tell me a little more about the teaching work you do.\n</strong>\nRegarding teaching work, I was very lucky. New York has a high standard of education in general and especially arts education, and I worked for one of the biggest and oldest theaters for children and families in the country called The New Victory Theatre. While I was there, I gained a lot of skills. They trained us all the time; they gave us workshops and professional development.\n\nInside of the school, I worked from eight through 12. I’m wasn't a full-time teacher so I could push in and out of the school. I could do workshops for four weeks, three months, or even one-off workshops. In New York, my curriculum was surrounding a work of art or a live performance. But now what I do is I work with all kinds of groups. I work with homeless groups, I work with the elderly, and I work with young people. And I work with them to use skills learned from theater to make their lives better.\n\n<strong>How do you do that?</strong>\n\nOne of the things I used to do is audition prep for young people that were going to audition for programs, like a theater program for example. What I found in doing that, is that I don’t like teaching acting. I do not like teaching drama skills for performance. I do not like what it does to people, like for example; I was working with a girl, and I thought she was great -- and she works hard. We were like three months in and then she doesn’t get into the school, all of a sudden she feels like a failure. I didn’t want to be associated with that. So what I do is I use skills and tools in the theater, for example, communication, eye contact, and being present, and I use all of that to teach life skills.\n\nI just finished working with inner city girls that were kind of on the edge; I used theatrical tools to develop self-esteem and self-love. So I do not teach acting.\n\n<strong>That’s really interesting.</strong>\n\nThank you, I love it. I live and breathe it.\n\n<strong>It’s a really interesting approach; it's more like using theater as therapy.</strong>\n\nOne of the things that I was going to do was drama therapy -- and I do it in a weird way. I’m not a certified drama therapist, but a lot of my work looks like drama therapy for sure.\n\n<strong>Explain to me how your sustainability theater workshops came together.</strong>\n\nI haven’t done one in years. But the sustainable theater workshops is something that I created following my first trip to Haiti; I’ve since been to Haiti four times. First time I went, though, I was shocked. I was teaching kindergarten at this time in Harlem, and while I was in Haiti, I was teaching five-year-olds that were working so that their families could afford for them to go to school. I was affected by that. I just couldn’t come to terms with the fact that five-year-olds in one place get so much privilege and then five-year-olds in another place are working all day. With that, I was like, \"Let me see which tools and skills I have that I can bring into areas where they don’t have them.\" What the workshops did was use theater help the children to tell their stories as a form of therapy.\n\nI held the Sustainable Theatre Workshop in Haiti first, then I did it in Jamaica, Senegal, and I did it in conjunction with the United Nations here in New York City. It's about giving a group of young people the skills to create their work of art.\n\n<strong>Is it something that you think you are going to do again in the future?</strong>\n\nI am going to do it again in the future, it just needs reworking in my mind, because I found that it wasn’t sustainable. There’s something about it at the core that I think needs to be revisited, and that’s why I haven’t done it again. Because I can’t do anything, I don't feel totally passionate about. Like everything I do, I have to believe in it 1000%.\n\n<strong>Which is fair – makes for a better product, right?</strong>\n\nRight, exactly. I’m not here to bullshit anybody; you know what I mean?\n\n<img src=\"http://aboveaveragehiphop.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Untitled-1-13.jpg\" alt=\"Untitled-1\" width=\"620\" height=\"375\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-5372\">\n\n<strong>So tell me about you and Ace – you’re the new hip-hop \"it\" couple.</strong>\n\nReally? That’s a huge compliment, thank you.\n\n<strong>How did you guys meet?</strong>\n\nOh, we met on Instagram. Every time I say this, I think of the fact that like when I first got an interview about this -- and I was like, \"What do I say to this?\" I called him, and I was like, \"Ace should I make up a story about how we met?\" He was like, \"No, you should tell the truth.\" We were just following each other for a long time, and commenting back and forth and, you know, it was a year full of that kind of stuff. I was like, \"Why is this guy following me?\" I’m thinking that I'm not his type; I’m not on that – you know, if you think of every rapper's type, I’m not that type. So I didn’t think anything of it.\n\nI was living in NYC at that time, and he was visiting, and my friends dared me to write him. I said, \"No way, I’m not going to write him, because it does not go down in the DM -- he’ll obviously think I’m a thot.\" You know what I’m saying, right? I am not about that life. Anyways, they broke me down, and I wrote him, and that was it. I think we met up the next day, and there hasn’t been a single day that we haven’t talked since.\n\n<strong>A lot of hip-hop industry couples end up on TV. Do you guys see yourselves being on Love and Hip-Hop, or that kind of thing?</strong>\n\nWe were already approached by Love and Hip-Hop a few times, and we have both decided against reality TV. We don’t want to be a reality couple. We don’t want to be identified as reality stars; we want our work to speak for us. Ace is an artist at the core. He does care about fame, he does care about money, but really, he cares about his music, and he wants to be known as an artist. I feel the same way. So no reality for us, as it stands now. Unless the face of reality just completely changes out of nowhere. I mean, where it is now, no. And I don’t want people in our fucking business, to tell you the truth. I feel like I’m a little bit of a shit show now and then, and I don’t want people judging me. I don’t want people in my relationship, you know. I just think it’s too much access.\n\n<strong>I don’t want to say it can destroy you, but it can destroy you. Everybody in America can think you’re an asshole because of the way the show makes you look, right?</strong>\n\nExactly, and then the thing that I’ve learned is that one-minute people can love you, and the next minute people can hate you, and you just never know when it’s going to be. You can never predict it. And I don’t want to get too wrapped up in that. Because It could twist in the drop of a dime, you never know.\n\n<strong>I mean look, LHH has been notorious for that. Where someone steps out and tries to do something and it just flops.</strong>\n\nIt’s so funny too because that’s one of their talking points. Look at Omarion; they were trying to explain to us that it can enhance us as artists – I was like, “It’s the exception, but that’s not the rule.\"\n\n<strong>What it can do is completely change your perception of how you look at those people. I mean, LHH Hollywood made Soulja Boy look like an asshole — as a legit bad person.</strong>\n\nAnd guess what? It makes a difference. It makes a difference because now do you listen to his music as readily? Like Stevie J; he lost all his credibility. But Omarion and his girl, they had a very good team. Like they had a very good balance of visibility and private life — and they came out pretty good. But I think just like I said, the exception is not the rule.I just don’t want to put myself in that. I don’t want to be a reality star; I know I’m better than that. No shade to any reality star, just for me.\n\n<strong>And then if you try to do other things they’d be like \"oh yeah, you’re that reality star.\"</strong>\n<blockquote>I don’t want to be a reality star; I know I’m better than that. No shade to any reality star, just for me.</blockquote>\nExactly, and I’m like, “No.\" I mean like even now, it’s a challenge for me not to be on some Instagram model shit. I don’t even know what that is. I’m not a model. I’m not an Instagram model; It’s hard when people want to put you in one box and keep you there — in anything.\n\n<strong>I mean, that’s part of why I wanted to interview you too. Because when I started looking you up, you do a lot of things, but I saw articles like, \"Ace Hood’s Bae, Top Ten Sexy Photos on Instagram.” I thought that downplayed you as a person...</strong>\n\nI hated that. Let me tell you; I cried the first time I saw it.\n\n<strong>I was like, \"Come on guys!\"</strong>\n\nXXL did something, Bossip did something a while back, a few other ones, but I mean, that’s what they do. It was a bit tough in the beginning when you have your whole family, and all of your extended friends, and everybody watching you and reading those articles, but you know...it’s much easier.\n\n<strong>What’s your favorite Ace Hood song?</strong>\n\nI like \"No More Mr. Nice Guy,\" because I’m a theater person, and I think that song is so theatrical. I just love it; it's dramatic. Then I love \"All The Way G,\" because he’s honest throughout that song — and he addresses a lot of things that he would never talk about. To me, that song marked his transition to being able to articulate himself more in his music.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Re9F1036Lss\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-dquhmPBTs\n\n<strong>On a personal level, what are you working on right now?</strong>\n\nI’m working on the Curvy,Curly, Concious tour for 2017; we are going to go to six different cities over the summer of 2017. We’re trying to decide the cities right now, and we’re getting funded together. So that's one of the things that I’m working on right now. And then I’m also writing a one-woman show because my creative side is something that I haven’t been nurturing as much lately, and I need it. So I’ve been writing, it’s been a few months. I write every day --I’m in the process.\n\n<strong>Do you have anything else you want to leave the interview with?</strong>\n\nI think no matter what you do, no matter how you do it, I think people should find ways to love themselves — and each other -- more, and just be more positive. I see a lot of it happening on my social media, and Ace’s social media, and if I can leave anything, it would be that.",

    "content_html": "Rapping came easy to Far Rockaway's Bynoe – it was second nature. He came up influenced by artists like Mobb Deep, Bob Marley, CNN, 50 Cent, Maroon 5, Biggie, Nas and Mary J Blige; his break in the game came when he began to start working on music with the late Stack Bundles. In June of 2002, they created Starting 5 [later renamed The Riot Squad], which was made up of members Stack Bundles, Cau2g$, Mike Millz, Bishop, and Bynoe. Two years later, the late Chinx joined the group in 2004 shortly before Mike Millz, and Bishop decided to call it quits. Stack signed was to DJ Clue's \"Desert Storm\" Imprint, which opened a lot of doors for the foursome. They recorded with the likes of  Kanye West, Jim Jones, Maino, Lil' Wayne, Tony Yayo, French Montana, and Mobb Deep. Also, they also worked with many DJ's such as DJ Clue, Pudgee P, Superstar Jay, Kay Slay and Scoob Doo. \n\nUnfortunately, Stacks was tragically gunned down in his neighbourhood in 2007, and eight years later, Chinx suffered a similar fate; he was killed in a drive-by shooting after a show in Queens last May. \n\nHaving suffered so much loss, which sandwiched a three-year weapons bid, Bynoe realized that music was/is his savior. He's now putting on not just for himself, but his fallen homies. He took a few minutes to chat with AAHIPHOP about his new music, his background, and his goals in the industry as a solo artist. Check his latest single featuring the late Chinx, and the short Q&A (below).\n\nhttps://youtu.be/un_VyuvaBKM\n\n<b>How did you originally get into hip-hop?</b>\n\nI got involved by listening to artist like Mobb deep and reciting their music and then putting it into my words. My older brother was a massive influence because he played music 24/7.\n\n<b>Tell me about your music.</b>\n\nMy music is raw and uncut. I write from a more aggressive standpoint because of my neighborhood -- but I can write and do any genre of music. I feel music has no boundaries depending on the vibe and type of beat; I write with that approach. \n\n<b>What do you want people to take away from Bynoe, the artist?</b>\n\nI want you to take from me as an artist as I'm just like you; I go through the same struggles, wins, and losses. I'm just like any average person, so I want you to see me as YOU -- and to always see the message in my artistry.\n\n<b>Are you aiming for a deal?</b>\n\nI love the independent grind and building from the ground up -- it's like a high for me. Rocking small venues, getting in touch with the people; it's more Intimate because I'm all about touching the people. I would do the major thing if it's the right situation, and I can expand my brand and agenda further without any boundaries.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/FV7bS11tivY\n\nhttps://youtu.be/6zJUlm-pjsA\n\nhttps://youtu.be/cEHhYN1LDG0\n\nhttps://youtu.be/ZFoFLjgmllg",

    "content_html": "Hailing from across the pond in Southampton, England, comes Hayze, who’d I’d classify as closely related to Trap. It’s funny upon my initial listen, I didn’t even notice he wasn’t from the US — that is until I realized I didn't fully understand the geographical references he was dropping. I’ll start with some background. Coming from a poor household, Hayze notes that he focused on music as, “It was truly all I had growing up.\" He refined his craft and developed a sound that is all about connecting with listeners through high-energy production, uplifting melodies, and a thought-provoking lyrical flow. His debut EP featured a random and unusual collaboration with Bizarre from Eminem’s infamous D12 crew — and a ton of gems worth multiple spins.\n\nAlso, he’s white — get over it. Some of his YouTube haters seemed to think that mattered; it doesn’t.\n\nNow, his music is insanely quality — like, at a level that most of the big dogs in the industry are at. Production wise, he works almost exclusively with [currently] with Jojo Farinella, Multi-instrumentalist, producer, singer and songwriter from the UK, who is lacing him with some of the filthiest trap beats we’ve heard in a while here at AAHIPHOP. Hayze is currently in the lab finishing off his debut full-length project but graced us with three cuts from the release. They had us open! Let’s start with the drug trafficking anthem, “Mayans! ” featuring Triggz, where he proclaims that he wants to “make enough dough to disappear like the Mayans.” The beat here is bonkers; and, we’d be surprised if you didn’t start hearing some major players in the (US) market rocking to Jojo Farinella beats. Menace is turning the UK into a go-to-market for beats. Next up, he professes his desire for girls around the globe on the record “She Whoooo.” This track is club/radio ready, so DJ’s should get up on it while it’s fresh. Lastly, “Loyalty,” is chalk full of quotable like, “They try to tell you they ain’t fake, funny, that’s what fakers say.”\n\nHayze is a good look, and his album — based on the samples he has chosen to share — should be a dope listen as well. His colour shouldn’t be an issue, unless he starts talking in a southern (US) accent [*cough Iggy]. Bump his latest, and stay tuned for his greatest.\n\nEarly. \n\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/253234266&color=ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false\"></iframe>\n\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/254895801&color=ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false\"></iframe>\n\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/250312147&color=ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false\"></iframe>\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSzhYj358iY\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dhJfj0SrpY",

His album Melanin is available for streaming and purchase on ITunes. Aesop Storyteller was a featured act for last week’s Vibes In the City. \n\n<b>AAHH: Cool name, how’d you come up with it? </b>\n\nAS: I got the name ASAP  from when I used to hustle in the streets in the late 90’s and early 2000’s. I had to change the spelling, so there’s no confusion with any other rappers. Storyteller came from my propensity to reenact or put a comedic twist on things that happened in the hood. Once I started making music professionally, I combined the two elements of my brand in the streets to create a modern-day version of the Great African storyteller and the creator of Aesop’s Fabbles who goes by the same name and spelling. \n \n<b>AAHH: Your Album <i>Melanin</i> is now available on ITunes and available for streaming on Apple Music. What was it like making an album like that? And what's your favorite song off there?</b>\n\n<b>AS</b>: Creating an album called <i>Melanin</i> took a whole lot of reading and watching boring YouTube documentaries about Africans worldwide. I came up with the concept while in Jamaica speaking to some Rastas about how best to honor our skin pigment and soulful expression. It is critically important that this album is in the marketplace at a time where collectively people are awakening to the fact that natural melanin characteristics and features are a sacred gift from God. My favorite song on this particular album is “Single and Ready To Mingle” because of the instant positive energy it spread. It’s a fun record to dance and be silly to. \n\n<b>AAHH: Five years from now, where do you see yourself as an artist? </b>\n\n<b>AS</b>: Five years from now I see myself touring the world, spreading my message of knowledge, self, and the growth of mind, body, and soul. But more importantly, I would love to continue to develop young people so that they can accomplish more than I ever did. \n\n<b>AAHH: Any social media? </b>\n\n<b>AS</b>: I’m on all major social media sites.

He also been featured in commercials, and even  apprared on movie screens -- you may have seen him without realizing it. He's rocked stages with the likes of Diddy, iLoveMakonnen, Barry Manilow, A$AP Rocky, Mario Winans, Rich Homie Quan, Robin Thick, Lil' Kim, Teddy Riley, and Jordin Sparks [just to name a few]. Also, he has been featured in New York Times, VIBE, Seventeen Magazine, and more. \n\nI mean, look, he took vocal lessons from Aretha Franklin!

Well, you don't have to start combing Google for a unicorn DJ blend that doesn't exist -- instead take a listen to Primo's cool new artist, Torii Wolf. Their wicked new song \"1st,\" is a blend of (almost) gloomy/haunting, ambient sounds you'd expect from someone like Adele, mixed cuts and a piano driven beat from Primo himself.\n\nTorii, who Preme lovingly referred to as \"weird in a good way\" in a press release, has an upcoming album called <i> Flow Riiot, </i>coming down the pipe, produced entirely by the famed hip-hop DJ. In the meantime, the single \"1st\" not only has a video, but a remix she recently dropped featuring the LA duo of Evidence and Rakaa, better known as the Dilated Peoples.\n\nIf you're not sold -- trust Premier 's ear. Torii is the first female artist to have an album entirely produced by him, which is a big deal!

    "content_html": "<blockquote>\"Can't be caught asleep if you the one these niggas sleeping on.\"\n\n—Sir B</blockquote>\nJust got my hands on a new project from the land of beautiful girls and palm trees, California. It comes from  Sir B, an artist who started getting some industry buzz back in 2013, both for playing Quentin Miller for a multitude of ATL rappers and dropping his debut mixtape, <i>SIR’tified</i>. His latest mixtape, which I've been playing all day, is <i>Letters From Rehab</i>, a tape that I fear may slide under the radar. I say fear, because while it does have some elements that may blend in with what's out there today, Sir B himself is incredibly charismatic -- he has that inexplicable \"thing\" that most big artists tend to have in common. This is the kind of tape that could [easily] become a staple of your summer.\n\nHere's the goods, the project, which is 15 joints long -- plus a bonus tune -- boasts a very well-curated blend of radio/ready production. It ranges from songs to play when your girl is in the whip, joints to knock when you're with the fellas, to more introspective music to bump solo while you ride around at night collecting your thoughts. There are a lot of new names gracing the producer credits, but I'd be demise not to mention that one of the bigger tunes here, \"Low Tho,\" is produced by the UK phenomenon, Menace, the young producer responsible to 2016 XXL Freshmen Desiigner's platinum record \"Panda.\" No biggie. The album is loosely conceptual, and is framed around a girl [presumably, his girlfriend] going off to rehab and writing a series of progressive letters. Didn't understand fully how it tied in beyond the interludes, cover art, and the song \"Amy Winehouse,\" but it still seemed to work, which is odd and difficult to explain.\n\nContent wise, he goes from Weekend drug use, straight up hip-hop bragging, chasing dreams, relationships. I had a few Standouts here I wanted to mention. \"Can't Buy Love,\" is a slow and sexy track that sees Sir B explaining to a young lady why she should let her walls down and follow her heart. On the same vibe is the zoned out \"Then Comes The Drugs,\" which you'll want to make the theme song to the post-Netflix portion of your summer 'Netflix and chill' sessions. Also, he spazzes on the album Outro, \"Leo DiCaprio,\" where he tackles studio gangsters always bragging on record: \"You ain't gotta tell us, we ain't even ask that; You got PTS? Always having flashbacks.\"\n\nIf you're a fan of what's out and about musically, you'll -- without a doubt -- enjoy this project. It's current, industry quality, and lacks any real filler material. Where Sir B excels, though, is his lyrical content and wordplay. The kid can rap, and had a wicked ear for beats. Add <i>Letters From Rehab</i> to your summer playlist -- because, dope. Be sure to follow him on <a href=\"https://exit.sc/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fsuperboisunday\">Facebook</a>.\n\nEarly.\n\nhttps://soundcloud.com/itsmesirb/sir-b-low-tho-prod-by-menace\n\nhttps://soundcloud.com/itsmesirb/cant-buy-love",

    "content_html": "<blockquote>\"I love reintroducing the songs that I know and love to another generation.\"\n\n—F. Carpé</blockquote>\nAn interesting artist landed in my inbox this week; Fantastical Carpé, shortened to F. Carpé made his way onto my watch list, and likely for a few reasons he didn't expect. First some context, he's a 27-year-old devout disciple of hip-hop from Oakland, California. He's self-produced and has a great sound that seems to draw from an eclectic blend of heads that came before him.\n\nHe credits names like Dilla, Common, Lupe, and Pharrell. When I listen to him, though, I thought about Oakland native <a href=\"https://youtu.be/3Dc8I23sCeI\">Saafir</a> [and his no-pen freestyle flow], LA producer <a href=\"https://youtu.be/tQ4osAh5t4o\">Madlib</a> [with his jazzy/scratchy loops], and his alter-ego <a href=\"https://youtu.be/IKphlX5XZ5k\">Quasimoto</a>  with his choppy yet intricate song arrangement. I began my trip through his Soundcloud by listening to his project <i><a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/fcarpe/sets\">F-am</a></i>, and was enthralled with his seemingly off-the-head style at certain points, the sometimes sporadic/ jarring beats with obscure samples woven in, and the overall structure. Tracks like the Beatles sampled \"Money,\" the jazzy \"Love Machine,\" and the standout \"The Family,\" really show off what he's capable off.\n<blockquote>Hip-Hop is my way of expressing the things that I can’t always articulate. It’s poetry for the soul.\"\n\n—F. Carpé\n</blockquote>\nSome tracks that you should use to \"introduce yourself\" to his sound is the über soulful \"Yes I,\" and \"Workin,\" which seems to be a staple of his live sets. Start there, and see where it goes -- he has lots to explore. The more I tried to put my finger on it, he reminds me of MF DOOM; not to say that he conceals his identity in any way, but similar to the villain on his pre-Madvillain gem <a href=\"https://youtu.be/xOYkjt9F81c\">MM...Food</a>, he takes chances. His music as a whole has a certain weirdness to it, which when played as a collection has numerous moments of gritty brilliance. He's very much a \"method to the madness\" type of artist.\n\nThis is headphone music for real heads -- I'm talking music lovers who like to float on clouds, bump dusty jazz loops, and give local and underground artists a chance. So put on your Raiders cap,  put on F. Carpé, and let it ride while you spend the afternoon cruising in the sunshine. Hit his <a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/fcarpe/sets\">Soundcloud</a>.\n\nEarly\n\nhttps://soundcloud.com/fcarpe/workin\n\nhttps://soundcloud.com/fcarpe/yes-i-do-it-smoove-najee-amaranth-of-oakland-mind",

    "content_html": "<blockquote>\"I don't think that there's pressure on any females to be lyrical. I don't think anyone looks for us to be lyrical anymore.\"\n\n– Intelligenz</blockquote>\nWhen it comes to contemporary hip-hop, there seems to be a definitive blueprint that's been etched out for a sea of artists to follow. This is particularly the case for female artists. Luckily, though, we have a handful of femcees -- or rather emcees -- cut from the cloth of pioneers like Mc Lyte, who put bars over everything. The lovely, and talented, Intelligenz, is one such artist. Are you type that needs a cosign to subscribe to an artist? She was the winner of MC Lyte’s Next Top Female MC Competition after driving from Las Vegas to LA to battle against Femcees from all over the country. Also, she's the first female artist signed to HiPNOTT Records, founded by [hip-hop blog G.O.A.T] Kevin Nottingham. That's a great start. She was approached by the label after reps saw her open for the Ruler Slick Rick.\n\nUntil now, we've only had a handful of [official] singles to go off, but she's currently working on her debut album, which should see the light of day soon. She recently sat with us here at AAHIPHOP to chat about her music, her career, obstacles female emcees face, and ageism in the game.\n\nGet to know Intelligenz!\n\nhttps://soundcloud.com/iamintelligenz/round-of-applause-intelligenz\n\nTell me a little bit about yourself -- and how you got into music.\n\nI'd say the most significant value to me is my faith, then my family; they're vital to me [my siblings, sisters, and brothers]. I got into music as a child; writing was kind of like my outlet. I started writing poetry and tapping into myself. I also used to draw and play with the keyboard a little bit. When I got to high school there were people in there rapping around my sophomore, and I was like, \"Oh, that's easy.\"\n\nAnd so we'd have little competitions, and instead of a 16, I'd come with like a 32 [laughs]. But, everybody had such a positive reaction. I had already been writing for years, but it was the first time I merged that with the beat -- and I just fell in love ever since. That was it. It was almost to a point where when I did write poetry I couldn't have music on because I couldn't detach from the rhythm.\n\nTell me a little bit about the projects you've done so far.\n\nI’ve just been putting out singles. I started late -- like 27 -- to get out there because I battled stage fright. So I spent the first couple of years just really trying to push a single called \"If You Ever Doubt It,\" get over stage fright, and just try to have a presence and connect with people. To be honest, at that time I was seeking validation for my talent. I mean, I'm talented but just to know if I believe in myself enough like that.\n\nAnd so I was getting ready to release my album, and I learned so much more about copyright law and realized that everything that I had I couldn't release. So I have projects that are unreleased. \"I'm a Movement,\" though, is my baby -- and the first song that I ever put on iTunes. It (really) introduced my story, paid homage to Nas and how I look to him as a mentor from a distance, and also spoke about the actions of female hip-hop artists in the game. Also, at the time, I was married, and I wanted to pay honor and tribute to my husband because he was my number one supporter.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCN6E8hF0uA\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oe_HjC77J3o\n\nSo there were a lot of tributes on that album. Also, I was hoping that people kind of pick up on me lyrically and my ability to construct a song as well from a writing perspective.\n\n<strong>What are you working on now?</strong>\n\nRight now I'm working on Everything I Am, which is going to be my debut album, which will be released under HiPNOTT. So that's important to me. I'm looking at potentially doing an EP to put out just to get some movement on the album before it drops, so I can give heads something to expect.\n\nI can tell you the goal of my album, which a lot of people aren't going to know, is that I don't want features on it. All the writing will be done by me, including any singing parts. There won't be anything except for maybe a singer. When it comes to rapping, I will be the only emcee that's on the album. I don't want to feel like that a beat has to carry me or another male emcee has to carry me. I want to stand on my own. So it will be a statement piece.\n\n<strong>Do you feel that, as a female emcee, there are more obstacles to getting into the industry?</strong>\n\nI'd say to be recognized as a solidified emcee, yes -- and I think there was a point in time where we could blame it on the males. But, I believe that now the blueprint is to put on stilettos and the closest pair of leggings. And that's the problem. We're focusing more on imagery than we are on the talent. So as far as pressure, I don't even feel the pressure from people go hard. Nobody cares about that; nobody cares about quality or consciousness.\n\nBut, I don't think that there's pressure on any females to be lyrical. I don't think anyone looks for us to be lyrical anymore. They look for sex appeal. So if there's any pressure I feel that I have, it's the pressure to deliver something that can captivate the minds that have already been molded only to expect sexualized content from me. There's pressure to see how can I penetrate those minds and make them appreciate music -- quality music\n\n<strong>Who have been some of your influences?</strong>\n\nNas number one. I feel like almost anything I write, I think if he [Nas] was in front of me, would I spit that for him? Then, Lauren Hill is everything to me. She's the perfect combination of artistry, consciousness, risk taker, authenticity. Then artists like Jean Gray (who's incredible of course) and Mc Lyte -- she's opened so many doors for us queens. Just people more so on the lyrical side, though.\n\n<strong>What would you say is your goal in this industry?</strong>\n\nMy goal is to break the barrier. My goal is to be challenged; my goal is to give back to hip-hop what it gave it to me. Some songs impacted me and changed my life; some songs prevented me from mistakes, and there are songs that gave me encouragement. Some songs kept me out of the club as opposed to the ones that are only putting people in there. My goal is to give them diversity again; to make people hungry to step in the ring again -- especially for women to give the other side. Today, it's almost like the only way that we define women as breaking barriers and being totally free is to be completely naked. We forgot about the power of being a minimalist and being in the forefront. I'm kind of tired of not seeing that other representation. If you don't want me to judge the other side for being revealing, then don't judge me for being less revealing. Let's just get back to the talent. My goal is to say \"it's never too late, we've got to follow our dreams.\" My goal is to break the stigma of how we age in the industry. Maya Angelou was able to do poetry until she died, but when you put a beat behind it and call it hip hop, all of a sudden when I hit a certain age I'm no longer authorized to be able to follow that same path.\n\nSo I'm just trying to uplift people who feel like maybe they're at a certain point in their life where they think, \"Oh, I didn't do it by this age. That's too late.\" Says who? We're living longer than we ever have. It's never too late!\n\n</ hr>\n\nStay tuned for part two of my conversation with Intelligenz.",

What he lacks in flashy gimmicks, he more than makes up for with a refreshing dose of realistic insight and knowledge of self.

With achievements that include nailing sponsorship deals with brands such as Casio’s G-Shock and Marc Ecko's once coveted clothing brand, and sharing the stage with Missy Elliot, Cee Lo Green, Akon, and many more, Sain (pronounced Sane) is on his way.\n\nHis latest release, the remix to his record \"They Don't Know,\" is at one a comment on his endless grind, and a universal anthem for persevering.

    "content_html": "<blockquote>\"As long as you have life, you can put up that fight!\"\n-- Cost</blockquote>\nBack in 2011, Bronx rapper, Cost, was looking for a band to back him for live performances. What he found is what we now, 5 years later, know as the Track Seven Band. Their latest EP, <em>The Try And The Fail</em>, which is ironically seven tracks, is a very deep, personal music journey through Cost’s life, set to rock/rap/pop infused live instrumentation that really takes everything to the next level. From come up to scathing commentary of social injustice, the record is a real winner.\n\nI’ll start with the elephant in the room, Cost, the lead singer/rapper, has a cadence that [sometimes] sounds like Brooklyn legend Jay-Z. It’s not a bad thing, and doesn’t appear to be any imitation; rather, it’s more of a Nas/Your Old Droog type of thing. By that I mean, he less like Jigga the more your bump the record. He isn’t oblivious, though. For example on the song “Doubt Me,” his “You’re now tuned into the most real,” sounds like a subtle nod, if nothing else. \n\nEnough of all that, though. I’ve been playing the EP on repeat for the past few days — it’s refreshing, original, and works on so many levels. First, let me give you the goods. The album is a rollercoaster of emotions, as we take a spin through the mindset of a man who’s seen the lowest lows, and made tough choices and leaps of faith to stand before you today. Cost, as we learn through the EP, lost his mother to cancer, which was extremely rough on him. On the record “Die,” he details both depression and insomnia. He even at one point makes a slight mention of suicidal thoughts. He also opens up about his past, his rough upbringing in Brooklyn, his past-life in the streets, and the hard choices that many marginalized heads at the bottom are faced with. “Go Get It,” which is an uptempo chase your dreams anthem; he makes reference to being \"mentored by BK crooks,” and having “packs in his backpack.” These both [among a bevy of other references] let listeners that this music is clearly a concession he made towards a better life. \n\nHe’s not in the clear, though, If I'm to take his song “I See You Boy,” at face value. The song, with a slight reggae tinge, details his homicidal plans to get revenge on an acquaintance that double crossed him. This record may add a bit of fictitious element to Cost as a character — if you’d like to see it that way. The 'never give up, followed my grind to get here' vibe is carried across other records on the EP like the title track, “Today,” and “The Message [which was my fave track].”\n\nEarlier, I mentioned that the project worked on so many levels. To clarify that point, the record is really (really) hip-hop. Cost is an amazing lyricist, and his bars and delivery are electric. However, the live instrumentation and the [at points] almost radio friendly aura of some of the records seem to suggest lots of crossover appeal. You could easily listen to this whole project without listening to the depth of the content, and just enjoy it for what it is. “I See You Boy” is an excellent example of what I mean. \n\nThe album is a breath of fresh air; the band compliments Cost entirely. I thoroughly enjoyed <em>The Try And Fail</em> and highly recommend you getting on board with these guys before they inevitably get where they’re going.\n\nTwitter: https://www.twitter.com/tracksevenband\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/tracksevenband\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/tracksevenband_official\nSoundcloud: https://www.soundcloud.com/tracksevenband\nWebsite: http://www.tracksevenband.com\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgxpfGwpC5U",

    "content_html": "<blockquote>\"Playing her (Angie Martinez) was like a dream.\"\n\n--Lian Toni Amado</blockquote>\nThe hip-hop community is buzzing about the release of the long-fabled Tupac biopic, <em>All Eyes On Me</em>. Like most of the world, we’ve been following the movie’s progress — and actual existence — through scattered Instagram pics that showed signs of, if nothing else, fantastic casting. One confirmed actress I found particularly exciting was the gorgeous Lian Toni Amado, who announced to the world via Instagram that she’d been cast in as the role of “The Voice Of NYC,” Angie Martinez. Many may, or may not, be aware of her <a href=\"https://youtu.be/N9gYXMr1BDA\">infamous interview with Pac at the height of the East/West drama</a>; however, only 12 minutes was ever released, with the remaining hour and forty-eight minutes staying in the vault. The casting of Lian was not only incredibly well-done, but it signified the overall care, and level of detail that the film had in store for us.\n\nLast week’s release of an official theatrical trailer has me more excited than ever to see the movie.\n\nLian, while busy packing for a trip to Miami, was kind enough to chat with me about her time on set, how she landed the role, and more. Check out the interview below.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQ0Tj2NgtaE\n\n<hr />\n\n<strong>How did you get into acting?\n</strong>\nI've only been doing it seriously for a couple of years. I started out just doing for fun. I had done a music video for an international artist from Australia and – long story short – I ended up getting an acting coach, and she helped set me in the right direction. This acting coach trains a lot of great music artists who convert into acting. After that, I took it seriously. I started to think I could do this as a real job.\n\nUp onto this point, everything I worked on has been film and a lot of it has been independent; like, I've had a film in Cannes, so I got to go to France for that. This is definitely like my biggest thing so far.\n\n<hr />\n\n<em>We dug up the video she mentioned, which featured Ja Rule. She was one of the twins sitting with Ja on the couch.</em>\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9QzSwLIKzI\n\n<hr />\n\n<strong>How did you originally audition for the role?\n</strong>\nIt's funny; I was going through something [personally] and had just stepped away from acting for like a month at that point. And two of my actor friends -- at different times -- had sent me the breakdown for the role and they're like, \"You should audition for Angie.\" But I was just like, \"No, I'm working. I am good right now.\" And then once my agent had sent it to me, I kind felt like I had to try. She sent it to me, and I put my (audition) on tape -- she sent it to me like 1:00 pm on a Friday night, and I was supposed to have it in by like 3:00 pm. So, I only had a few hours to work on it. Saturday morning, my agent called me and asked if I could be in Atlanta by Monday for a callback. After the call back I didn't hear anything for almost two months.\n\nI went into the callback and auditioned for Carl Franklin, who was the second director that was on board. The next day a <a href=\"http://www.indiewire.com/2015/11/carl-franklin-exits-tupac-shakur-biopic-benny-boom-replaces-him-will-the-film-ever-get-made-166540/\">press release comes out that he had dropped out of the film</a>. So I was like, \"Well, there goes my audition.\" I felt like I came to Atlanta for nothing.\n\nSo this was like maybe mid-November, it was around Thanksgiving. It was almost the middle of January when I got the call from the office that I was their first option and asking if I would take the part.\n\n<iframe src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/146469516\" width=\"640\" height=\"1138\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe>\n\n<strong>So, what was the experience like?\n</strong>\nI loved playing her. I have a really, really, really big passion for music; if I could sing, I would have been a singer. When I was younger, I interned at Def Jam as well as at some other big music companies. I'm really into music. So any project that involves music and film is like a dream. Like, Selena. That type of movie. When I got the part, I remember thinking \"This is what JLo felt like when she booked Selena.\"\n\nUsually, anytime I book anything, or I'm working on stuff, it's always stressful. But I didn't feel like that with this character; I learned so much. I played young Angie, so I played her back in the 90s when the whole East Coast/West Coast thing was going on. So I was young at that point, I didn't know how serious it was. So, while doing my research, there was a lot of things that I learned that I didn't even know happened. I didn't know about the drama that happened at the <a href=\"https://youtu.be/JpgpS3ogvMM\">Source Awards in '95</a>.\n\nIt felt right. I just remember sitting on set and then getting into the wardrobe; it just...felt really good. Good to play her. Playing her was like a dream.\n\n<strong>Did you connect with her or did you talk to her before you like played the role?</strong>\n\nNot before. She didn't know that she was in the film. I had sent her flowers just to introduce myself a couple of months ago, because I was like talking to a friend and it's like, \"It's weird, you're playing somebody who's alive -- maybe you should like to introduce yourself.\" So just sent her flowers to introduce myself, and she went on the air and talked about how she didn't even know that she was in the film. But, she's setting up an interview, cause she was all like, \"I want to know who you are, what's happening, and what I'm doing in the film.\" She has no idea. So I didn't meet her yet, but I will soon.\n\n<strong>Have you seen any cuts of the film yet? </strong>\n\nI saw some when I was there. It was cool cause when I was on set, one of Pac's uncles was there. They were playing some of the scenes from the Black Panthers movement. I didn't know much about the whole movement, so I had to do my homework. It was strong, though. Danai Gurira --the actress playing Afeni Shakur was on set the same time as me. I was watching the scenes that she was in, and they looked amazing.\n\nI don't want to give too much away. Yeah, I got to see some of the stuff on set, and it all was really good. Even seeing the actors on set dressed as who they are, it was real.\n\n<strong>The more you start seeing pictures, and even when I saw you in costume on Instagram, it hints at how deep into the story (the film) gets, which is exciting!</strong>\n\nThey show everything. A lot of (the film)has to do with his life, his upbringing -- so it's not just his music career. My part is towards the end of the movie, once he was full blown, but I felt the same way. Angie is a legend herself; she's classic. She reminds me of that era -- and on top of that -- she has all but 12 minutes of her <a href=\"\"http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/magazine-feature/7356952/angie-martinez-tupac-shakur-interview-remembrance-memoir-excerpt-exclusive”\">(epic) interview with Pac</a> that she never released. So she's a really big part of the story. I feel like she might know more about Pac and anybody. And I know her book just came out, and she put some stuff out about the interview that she has yet to release. He put out so much out to her. So yeah, I feel the same way. It's cool. It just adds a classic piece of history to have her in it.\n\n<strong>The hope is that it does for Pac what <em>Straight Out of Compton</em> did for NWA, which was put a whole new generation onto his legacy.\n</strong>\nI agree. I feel like even when I watched <em>Straight Out of Compton</em>, being from the East Coast, I didn't know all the West Coast stuff, so I learned a lot watching that film.\n\n<strong>I'm assuming every Tupac album will be number one on iTunes after the film’s release. So, what's next for you?\n</strong>\nI'm working on a play, but I can't say a lot about it. But I'm working on a play that’s going to happen sometime in late 2017, and it has to do with the hip-hop culture. But, it's just in the beginning stages. Besides that, just staying in the same hustle that I was in before -- just auditioning. After I had got home (from doing All Eyes On Me), I was like on a high for like a month, and then I was like, \"Okay, I have to get back to where I was at right before all of this.\" So we're just grinding. I just came back; I was in LA for pilot season. I'm just in the same hustle as before, ready for whatever is next.\n\n<iframe src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/152478745\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe>",

    "content_html": "Here at aahiphop, we're still not a level like Complex or Fader, so we had to watch Kanye's new visual, \"Famous,\" like everyone else -- live on Tidal X. What an experience. It was difficult, but I tried not to read anything about the video, so I could honestly go in blind. Wow, what an experience.\n\nSo, there's not much to it; however at the same time, there's a lot to it. Let me set the scene. Kanye's recreated <a href=\"http://aboveaveragehiphop.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/img_5396.jpg\">Vincent Desiderio's painting \"Sleep,\" from 2008</a>. In Kanye's version, he's assembled Taylor Swift, Donald Trump, Anna Wintour, Chris Brown, Rihanna,Kanye, Kim Kardashian, Bill Cosby, Caitlyn Jenner, George Bush, Amber Rose, and Ray J. Close inspection would suggest that they are incredibly life-like mannequins -- but, there has been no confirmation yet. That's part of the fun, though, right?\n\nThe video, in my opinion, does a few things. One is that it makes you feel incredibly uncomfortable. Although all naked, there isn't anything sexual about this situation. Rather it almost feels invasively voyeuristic. Perhaps this is a subtle comment on how we put celebrities underneath the microscope. This is extreme, but how far is too far? Is this what we want? When the music drops out, and all we hear is snores, and breathing, it's over the top  awkward, but also the most powerful.\n\nAnother thing this video does is humanize the subjects. They are just bodies. Just humans. Like anyone else. We get so used to seeing celebrities at their most glamorous, but this video [literally] strips all that away, leaving people; sleeping.\n\nThis isn't the first time Kanye has drawn inspiration from <a href=\"https://youtu.be/L53gjP-TtGE\">artwork for his visuals</a>, but it's certainly going to go down as the most memorable.\n\nWas that Taylor though?\n\n<a href=\"http://aboveaveragehiphop.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/img_5401.jpg\"><img src=\"http://aboveaveragehiphop.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/img_5401.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"620\" height=\"620\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-5837\"></a>",

    "content_html": "\"First N--ga taught that crippin' to your kids, huh,\" proclaims Snoop Dogg -- and rightfully so. Unless the average middle class American [white] kid was jamming to groups to Compton's Most Wanted, which wasn't a sure bet in pre-Internet hip-hop, Snoop's brand of 'Gangsta Rap' on the much-lauded Doggystyle was an eye opening experience. So much so that they tried to shut the genre down, ironically giving it more allure (like telling kids to stop smoking). Since then [1993] Snoop has soared to unbelievable heights; from making too many classics to list here, to television appearances and cult status. He's the most recognizable face in hip-hop history, his latest album, Coolaid, seems like a victory lap.\n\nLast week Snoopy unleashed the project's lead single, \"Super Crip,\" produced by heavyweight Just Blaze. The track was an exciting reworking of the iconic west coast funk of yesterday, with an undeniably current feel. Over the electric soundbed, Snoop sounded reinvigorated, and fresh. Coolaid, as a complete package, is much the same. Snoop is a legend, and he knows it -- he spends a good portion of the project's 20 tracks exploring his status, reminding everyone that he's the nucleus of west coast hip-hop, and giving long-time fans the refreshed, focused Snoop Dogg they deserve.\n\nThe album seems to have three very distinct lanes, thick, syrupy, west coast funk, music to crip to, and filler.  The latter includes songs like the \"My Carz,\" and the album's intro, \"Legend,\" with an awkward slow-flow on a one-off trap beat that seems out of place. Snoop hits his stride, though, as soon as the second joint, \"Ten Toes Down,\" drops. From the Paid In Full excerpt, we can begin to understand that Snoop wants listeners to know that he (just) can't leave the game alone. Perhaps, he wonders if completely abandoning his core audience would render him forgotten, much like Mitch contemplated in the emotionally charged scene [in the film]. On the song \"Coolaid Man,\" Snoop subtly let's other artists know that not only does he not sound like anyone else out -- but that he's aware of who's been borrowing his style. \n\nWith multiple collaborations with Alicia Keys' beau Swizz Beats and Just Blaze, and guests verses from the likes of his smoking buddy (and Mac & Dre co-star) Wiz Khalifa, Detroit Capo Trick Trick, and west coast legend in his own right, Suga Free (amongst a host of other), Snoop delivers a solid track list. If the west side street-hop doesn't hit you, the radio-ready vibe of \"Point Seen Money,\" featuring Jeremih, the funky \"Feel About Snoop,\" or the club-ready \"Double Tap,\" featuring E-40 and Jazzy Pha, will. There's something for everyone, no matter which era/iteration of Snoop you've come to most closely identify with.\n\nFrom the super dope artwork to the overall vibe, the project is worth a spot on your summer playlist. Roll a fatty, turn up, and beat the summer heat with tall glass of Cool Aid.",

Then you have the conscious types like Kendrick and J.Cole…I incorporate all of that in my music.\"\n--F.A.A.N.A.N.</blockquote>\nF.A.A.N.A.N. -- an acronym that means Forever ABOVE the Average, Never Ask for Nothing -- is a 26-year-old artist from Ensley, which is one of the roughest parts in Birmingham, Alabama. A self-described laid-back guy, he tends to describe his sound as backpack, as opposed to trap or gangster hip-hop. People who know him say he rolls down a similar lane as Wale, Chance Tha Rapper, Childish Gambino. How can you not be intrigued?\n\nHis latest release, <em><a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/contradiction-feat.-quentinsounds/id1128310114\">Contradiction</a></em>, is interesting because it seems like an apparent contradiction to his personal description of himself, whether he meant it to be or not; it's anything but straightforward. While it has some classic hip-hop songs/elements intertwined throughout the thirteen tracks, there is also some sexy radio-ready R&B, a few moments that border on neo-soul, some southern vibes, and -- of course -- some of the bassy braggadocious sounds of the day. There isn't much filler on this LP, and it seems well paced and produced.\n\nHe proves himself as a lyricist off the rip, with the horn-filled intro, \"True 2 Me,\" which actively positions his skill level, and depth of socio-political awareness. He starts to seemingly switch up focus over the next few tracks, from the 'things won't change' themed \"<a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/f-a-a-n-a-n/never-quit\">Never Quit</a>,\" to the focused female records that follow [and dominate a heavy portion of the project's first half]. That's not a bad thing, though. \"Pick Up,\" and \"New Things,\" are two of <em><a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/contradiction-feat.-quentinsounds/id1128310114\">Contradiction's</a></em> highlight [IMHO]. \"New Things\" actually puts me in the mind of \"Marvin's Room\" by The 6 God, Drake, from his Sophomore release. The project -- lyrically -- is full of truths, experience, and soulful, glimmering positivity.\n\nThe must-listens here are the soulful \"Feels Good,\" the jazzy \"Golden,\" and the \"Bumpy's Lament\" sampled \"Playing In The Wind.\" \n\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/261060211&color=ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false\"></iframe>\n\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/239303047&color=ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false\"></iframe>\n\n<em>\"I want people to see the hard work I put into every song I make. Every work you hear on my song I wrote and came up with myself. Even if I have a singer featuring, I wrote the melodies and the words. I put a lot of time into making sure I am competitive with those already in the industry because I don't feel that being unsigned is an excuse. I want people the listen to my music and hear the lyrics and understand that you can have a conscious rapper and still enjoy the music at the same time.\" \n—F.A.A.N.A.N.</em>\n\nF.A.A.N.A.N.'s <em>Contradiction</em> [his third full-length release] seems incredibly well put together, well produced, and well packaged. You'll wonder why he isn't much bigger; well, the music industry is a crazy place. He sounds like he's one chance meeting or good look away from the next-level. Somebody sign this kid, ASAP.

    "content_html": "Twenty years later, Summer 2016 stands as a pivotal period in hip-hop. Let's set the scene -- Bill Clinton was running for re-election, VHS was still a viable format, people were still waiting for N64 to drop, EBay launched, and Donovan Baily set a world-record at the Atlanta Summer Olympics. It was also the year that hip-hop was blessed with [what in hindsight] can be considered as bonafide, game-changing classics.\n\nFor one, Jay-Z dropped his classic debut Reasonable Doubt. Although at the time we couldn't have known, it stands as the rawest, most hungry -- and crucial -- project in his catalog. He's often noted that it's the album that took his whole life up to that point to write. It's ultimate success held Jay's future in its palms. Had it flopped, Jay admits that he would have stuck to what he knew best, hustling. We, of course, know how the story went. Nas also had an album drop just over a week later. This is more significant if you consider the [on wax] battle they engaged in roughly six years later. It Was Written was a departure for Nas -- well, sort of. At the time, he was criticized for lacking the emotion of Illmatic, which seems ridiculous now. It was much more successful commercially, led by the single \"If I Ruled The World,\" featuring Lauren Hill, whose group The Fugees had dropped their debut The Score earlier that year.\n\nDe La Soul also dropped a record that summer. Although not as widely commercially viable as the other two previously mentioned, it was a huge turning point for the group For one, it was their first time not collaborating exclusively with Prince Paul. The result was a much more varied sound and was the last project the group released in the 90s. It also was one of the first major appearances of the now incomparable Mos Def. Tribe Called Quest also held the Native Tongues down with the release of Beats, Rhymes, & Life. If their biopic rings true, the album was many things. It was the last album where the original members all had their heart in it from cover to cover. It was also the first time we were introduced to Consequence on the classic summer-record “Stressed Out,” featuring Faith Evans. “1nce Again” was also a big single that ruled airwaves and boomboxes.\n\nOn the south side of things, ATL duo Outkast released their critically acclaimed sophomore album, ATLiens. A lyrical departure from their debut, the album (which has since gone double platinum) ruled the latter part of the season with the ultra-catchy slow-flow of Elevators. Also from ATL, underground legends, UGK dropped their [often cited] Ridin’ Dirty. With no videos or actual singles, the project remains their most successful. Many artists, including Drake, have given it a place on their top lists.\n\nTwenty years is a long time, and it hits home when you realize it. We older heads are often hard to the younger generation for not being fully up on some of these classics, but they dropped a lifetime ago. Literally. For those of us who spent the long hot summer of 1996 chanting “Jay-Z and Biggie Smalls, nigga shit your drawers,” debating on the commercialization of hip-hop (a topic prevalent since artists like Hammer broke through), and sweating out Kani t-shirts under the blazing sun -- 1996 remains in our hearts.\n\nHere are all of the albums mentioned — for either reminiscing or educating yourself.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MquyMZadfKE\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A3A--8GraQ8\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL759B534DFAB95D08\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLDD8E141F241548C6\n\nhttps://youtu.be/8VvCze8cytg\n\nhttps://youtu.be/JhijGELGeoQ",

    "content_html": "Hip-hop -- as a vehicle capable of social change -- often comes down to a series of cosigns, which is understandable in a sea of millions of voices struggling to be heard. Well, 30-year-old emcee Will EQ has that covered. A ride through his audibly scenic SoundCloud, features alongside the massively successful rapper/producer David Banner, and 2016 XXL Freshman Dave East is sure to grab your attention; at the very least, it makes Will seem connected in the industry. Don't get lost in the weeds, though. His <a href=\"https://exit.sc/?url=http%3A%2F%2Finstagram.com%2Fwilleq\">Instagram [video] album  <i>Dark Years</i></a> is innovative for a lot of reasons -- and a solid bridge to his upcoming release, which he describes as more bright and uplifting; like a light after the dark. Dope right?\n\nWell, Will EQ took some time out from his grind to answer some questions for AAHIPHOP -- check out his interview below.\n\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"450\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/270163282&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true\"></iframe>\n\n<i>So, what are you all about?</i>\n\nI am about uplifting my community, and music is an outlet for me to \"reach out and touch people\" verbally. \n\n<b>How would you describe your music?</b>\n\nThe sound is a conscious southern sound. Others have compared it to a modern day Outkast type sound or a southern Kanye sound. \n\n<b>How did you get in the game? What are you working on?</b>\n\nI have been involved in music all my life. Many members of my family are musicians and producers (including Nitti Beatz). I also have ghostwritten for various artists - but I prefer not to go into detail about that. My influences are Outkast, Jay-Z, Nas, Killer Mike and a Tribe Called Quest. I have a record out with Dave East and another with David Banner. I am about to drop a longer version of the Dark Years mixtape and then my EP in the fall called Light Years.\n\n<b>How did you link Dave East?</b>\n\nDave East came about because my manager had connected with his manager. We wound up doing a great record together called \"Started In The Hooptie.\" That guy is uber talented.\n\n<b>How about Dave Banner? He's a genius...</b>\n\nYes, David Banner is a genius. It was an honor working with him. My cousin Nitti Beatz connected us (and produced the song) - \"Mu Fucka\".\n\n<b>What would you consider a huge achievement in your career?</b>\n\nI measure achievements differently, so to me the biggest achievements when fans quote my lines because they have a deep connection with the meaning(s).\n\n<b>What was the concept behind <i>Dark Years</i>?</b>\n\nThe concept behind <i>Dark Years</i> was to give ppl a sample of the new material I am working on - which organically was coming out dark. The plan was to drop videos of the material on Instagram - and make it the first IG mixtape. Just wanted to be innovative and creative. However, I also plan on releasing a full version of the project (i.e. full songs - as opposed to the 1 minute IG videos) next month. The follow-up, <i>Light Years</i>, will be a collection of \"brighter,\" more uplifting songs.\n\n<b>What is your goal, ultimately?</b>\n\nMy main goal as an artist is to reach and connect with as many fans as possible - to give them music with a message that they can still jam to. I'm increasing my ability to uplift and strengthen my community and people in general. So if music allows me to do that, then that is my \"come up.\"",

    "content_html": "<blockquote>\"I want the world to know that there can be more than one successful female hip-hop artist. I also want people to realize they can be themselves and not copy everything you see.\" --J. Anise</blockquote>\nA fresh EP came by my desk this week, courtesy of LA-femcee J. Anise. She’s got the look, the pen game, and the music to back it all up; needless to say after a few listens I was thoroughly impressed. I’ll back up a bit. Meet J. Anise, straight out of Saginaw, Michigan. She dropped her first mixtape <em>Lamborghini Livin: The Take Off back in 2011</em>, so she’s been going hard for a while now. The EP in question, <em>Higher Than Most 2</em>, actually comes on the heels of the <em>Higher Than Most 2 Mixtape</em>  which dropped about a month ago via SoundCloud. That project had fifteen joints (which includes freestyles). That mixtape was a follow-up to the original <em>Higher Than Most</em>. Basically, what I’m getting at is that she has <strong>LOTS</strong> of material out there, and it’s all quality. She has bars, and her obvious work ethic makes her worthy of any and all praise she’s [most likely] going to get in this game.\n\nEnough buttering her up for some possible exclusives [*cough cough] let’s delve into the EP. It’s six tracks long, so a relatively easy listen without making a big time commitment. I’ll note that before I delved into her catalog, I started with her EP, so my initial thoughts didn’t reflect any of her past material. To be very frank, I wasn’t blown away initially. The first two tracks \"All About My Cash\" and “Lit” are ok, but nothing out of the ordinary in either content or production. They are cool, just not anything special. So when I started “Basic,” I didn’t have the bar that high. This is where I began to get her as an artist; she separates herself from 'basic chicks,’ who not only spend time/effort working out their Twitter fingers but also don’t know their true worth aside from a shallow existence. “Confidence is sexy, and I come from all angle.” Her confidence shines through, and by the end of the track I had a better idea of what made her different from a good portion of forgettable female artists forced into my eardrums. The three songs that followed were crazy. “Enough” and “Be Like That” seem like they have some relation regarding the catalyst/subject matter -- the latter being a personal message. Would love to hear the real story behind that one. If I had to package the EP with an overall theme, it seems like over the course of the project’s creation (or in recent history) she’s trimmed the (metaphorical) fat from her circle and life. It seems as though she’s taken considerable effort to expel any negativity from her circumference in favor more positive blessings that her career seems to be affording her. \"Sweet Dreams” comes across as a final middle finger to all the doubters and supposed ride or dies that for whatever reason decided they didn’t fully support her vision and journey. \n\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/271409227&color=ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false\"></iframe>\n\nBottom line, J. Anise. I also want to -- before I end this — bring up her latest single dropped less than 24 hours ago. The immediate, and well-timed, “Guard My Body,” was made in response to the senseless police violence that’s taken place this week. Worth a listen. Add the Higher Than Most 2 EP to your weekend playlist, and put this lady on your playlist; you heard it here!\n\nhttps://youtu.be/KFRymWdFpAQ\n\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"450\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/playlists/237284372&color=ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false\"></iframe>",

    "content_html": "<blockquote>\n\"Your body is just a cocoon for your soul to develop. And when you die, you will connect back with this energy in its purest form.\"</blockquote>\nHip-hop is a weird thing in that it has definitive origins, and a straightforward -- almost stereotyped or generalized -- approach that we older heads use as a reference point with which to judge how dope something is. As with anything that ages, though, things change, and conventions are challenged. Hip-hop has gone through numerous regional phases over the years, but none have seemed more jarring for older listeners than  Cloud Rap, which is a blanket subgenre accredited to artists from Lil'B and A$AP Mobb to Space Ghost Purp, Lil Yachty, and Post Malone. Stepping away from the obvious experimentation by \"lyricists,\" producers have become increasingly willing to experiment, and in many ways, let the beats speak for themselves. Flying Lotus, for example, has made the possibility of releasing an ambient audio journey -- and even creating live experiences -- a viable and lucrative move for anyone creative enough to walk that path. CQFST, a production duo from LA, are not only headed down that path, but they're also branching out and looking for shortcuts. Their latest release <i>Mind Made Up </i>is a five track descent into madness that, while [definitely] not a casual listen, is a dope listen none the less.\n\n<i>Mind Made Up </i>is moody, atmospheric, and -- some points -- a little uncomfortable. It's also precise, methodical, and an obvious labor or love. Fully sample-based, the [conceptual] piece is described as being one of a few possible things on the duo's Bandcamp page: a concept album about losing your mind, a story about someone having a bad trip, or a concept album about someone dying. Interestingly, if you listen with one of those concepts in mind, it creates a different feeling -- weird right? Amidst the spacey and sometimes eerie sounds, they've dropped ambient, distorted lyrics that are more spoken word than straight forward \"bars.\" They've taken the liberty of including them all on their Bandcamp, in case you can't catch them all. There is deep shit here, like, \"despite being last in line he kept on keeping -- to find the key keeper is blind and losses are fine;\nexcept, when they involve the mind.\"\n\nWith this record, the duo made up of Casper Q & Skinny Talls, make their official debut as full-blown producers. <i>Mind Made Up</i> is an interesting listen, to say the least; more of an art project, for those who dig that sort of vibe. Not the every day -- which is a good thing. Try something new.\n\nEarly!\n\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"450\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/users/96751203&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true\"></iframe>",

    "content_html": "[dropcap]I[/dropcap] suggest we cut Rich Homie Quan a little slack. Did he break your heart yesterday and epically fudge up a performance of \"Get Money?\" Yes -- but, before he has a chance to [maybe] come up with an excuse, let me offer up a theory: Biggie doesn't mean that much to him! There. I know, it's hard for some of us to stomach -- the idea that perhaps someone doesn't <i>love</i> Biggie Smalls, the king of NYC. Consider, though, that Quan is 26 years old; he was 8 when Biggie Smalls was tragically murdered. He was also living in the south and was admittedly artistically influenced by artists like Outkast and Jeezy. I'm sure Quan is aware of who Biggie is and what he represents to people, but -- understandably -- he hasn't played a very memorable role in his personal experience. Listen, if you didn't experience Biggie during his apex, then it's hard to feel the same affinity towards him that [we] do. Timeless is a subjective term.\n\nThis isn't the first time we've seen this -- VH1 has a history of trying to get a new generation of artists to pay homage to artists that don't have any real \"role\" in their personal relationship with hip-hop [Note, VH1 puts this together, not the other way around]. They tried this with Lupe when he dropped the ball during a Tribe Called Quest tribute. He admittedly hadn't even listened to <i>Midnight Marauders</i> -- luckily [although far from unnoticed] Twitter hadn't reached it's current Super Sayan form yet, so no memes. Quan, though, wasn't so lucky.\n\nIt's not an excuse; these artists [Quan and Lupe] were paid to perform, and did terrible jobs at it. We can maybe understand why the lyrics may not be emblazoned into their brains, though. To the same effect, I don't know every word to \"Friends\" by Whodini. Also, is \"Get Money\" really one of the essentially \"must-know\" Biggie verses by casual listeners/fans? He <b>may</b> have nailed \"Juicy,\" or \"Mo Money Mo Problems,\" for example.\n\nLook, this was a terrible idea all around. Quan takes an L for not memorizing the words, but VH1 takes a massive L for dressing him like Biggie and expecting it to be <i>ok</i>. I get what they were going for, but it didn't work out. Maybe next year they'll have Lil' Yachty perform 2Pac's verse from Digital Underground's \"Same Song.\" SMH!\n\nRIP Biggie.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/ktTc_ENe_40",

    "content_html": "Dr. Dre once famously said that this [music] business is entertainment; to believe it to be anything else then that would be “stupid [sic].” ScHoolboy Q, when examined under this lens — for me  — has made him a more appealing artist. Not to say that his background in any way doesn’t check out — that’s not what I'm saying. However, a recent interview with Vice revealed the softer side of him: a (former) drug-user and father, who worries that his seven years old will one day stumble upon his music, which will spawn what [he imagines] will be an awkward conversation. His current lifestyle is far from what he portrays in his music, which arguably makes it easier to not only let loose from his perspective but separate himself from his on wax persona. This is something that artists like Kanye have a hard time doing. Schoolboy, while fully bare-faced, becomes an almost MF Doom like character who leads listeners through seedy, drug-laced audio adventures along the drug-infested, violent streets of Compton, California. Of course, there are brief opulent intermissions from his heavy dose of reality, and he takes on personas like Blank Face and Groovy Q. \n\n<em>Blank Face LP</em>, the sophomore seventeen track effort from TDE’s second biggest export, is a moody, well-curated follow-up that doesn’t diverge too far from what worked for Q on his debut effort, Oxymoron. There are numerous impressive features that don’t seem to insist upon themselves — meaning that Q at no point leans on his features. Everything compliments everything. That’s no easy feat; if you’re fan of the funky vibes of Kendrick’s TPB, you’ll love the production here. \"THat Part,\" featuring Yeezy Kardashian and a new version of \"Groovy Tony,\" featuring the self-proclaimed Top 5 DOA Jadakiss are the most obvious stand-outs (off the jump). Q spazzes on joints with Vince Staples, the Dogg Pound, and even Bay-Area rap god E-40 on the bassy \"Dope Dealer.” He switches up the vibe at a few points, too. “Kno Ya Wrong,” featuring the [mhsterious] Lance Skiiwalker, and the closest thing to a girl track on the album, “Overtime,” featuring Miguel and Justine Skye.\n\nI’ll put out there that my (personal) fave moments on this album are “Neva CHange” and “Black THougHts.” \"Neva CHange,\" which has a hook from Jersey songstress SZA, is an ode to project heads that never seem to elevate and get their shit together; whether it’s personal — or not — is curious. It sounds personal, though. “Black THougHts” has an ill jazzy sample that sees Q breaking down his upbringing, and breaking down walls — even proclaiming the need for both sides to unite. He even uses the concept of all lives matter to refer to both “sides” [bloods and crips]: \"Let's put the drugs down and raise our kids, let's put the guns down and raise our spliffs.\" \n\nQ is the product of the California sun-kissed, gang-ridden streets — and that comes across in his music. But he’s also made it out and is in a position where he’s making serious cash alongside the biggest crew in the game. He’s making [his] world a better place for his daughter to grow up in. <em>Blank Face</em> is a lot of the same old  ScHoolboy you’ve come to love — but with a dose of newfound retrospective [know better do better] sentiment in the mix. All in all, he’s made his growth apparent; It’s an excellent sequel to a noteworthy debut.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZiRGvl7H7Y8\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQ_DHRI-Xp0\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7iJDXIOk0bg",

    "content_html": "I’m a writer — obviously — and I’m usually on it. But I must admit, for a good part of the early 2000s, I was an artist myself, slugging it out in the studio, flipping through beat tapes, combing record shops for rare 90s instrumentals, and getting lit [before lit was such a cheesy overused term]. I also, as hard as I tried, missed out on some arguably essential musical phenomenon. One such universally, and critically hailed, highlight was The Avalanches’ <em>Since I Left You</em>, a 3500 sample melting pot of hip-hop, EDM, and soul infused art hailed as one of the top 10 albums of the decade. Rightfully so — The Australian export was a hungry crate digger's dream. A thought provoking soundtrack to a sweaty summer night.\n\nHow the fudge did I miss it?\n\nWell, I caught up — and have spent the better part of the month enjoying their (long awaited) follow-up, <em>Wildflower</em>. It’s quite literally the best listening experience you’ll have this month. It’s hip-hop, it’s classic samples, it’s upbeat — it’s perfect. Off the bat, if you only have time for one [3:44] listen, pop on track three, \"Frankie Sinatra,\" featuring Detroit swag-god, Danny Brown, and the incomparable MF Doom. Danny also appears on \"The Wozard Of Iz.\" Other guests include the diabolical Biz Markie, delivering his usual level of bizarre Biz-ness on “The Noisy Eater,” and the “Lucini” duo, Camp-Lo, on the soulful 70s “Because I’m Me.” \n\nTo understand the work that went into this album is to know the love and care that the group puts into their craft. Recorded over the period 16 years, amongst illness, [inner] comings and goings, sample clearance issues, and a lack of rumors, the album is a masterpiece, and one of the finest examples of plunderphonics you’re likely to find. If you’re a fan of producers like J.Rocc, you need to get up on this album — immediately.\n\nBonus, this mash-up video is insane.\n\n<style>.embed-container { position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; } .embed-container iframe, .embed-container object, .embed-container embed { position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; }</style><div class='embed-container'><iframe src='http://thewas.xyz/' style='border:0'></iframe></div>",

A young rapper by the name of Geoffrodamus -- just trying to get his name out there. The project is called <i>The Fresh Air EP</i>; with a running time of only 19 minutes, it's succinct, but devoid of too much filler. Sonically, it's a blend of soulful samples, dark Tyler The Creator-esque production aesthetic, and an admirable amount of slow-flow truth and substance. I'm always down to support these young cats that drop records without conforming to the yawn-inspiring trap-wave currently running the scene. With more and more emphasis on bars, and the game [seemingly] beginning to regress back to a skills-first mentality, this kid may just have the right idea.\n\nContent-wise, it's a blend on very short 1-2 verse records and interlude type joints, with some pretty heavy stuff. \"Let's Be Real,\" for example, sees him touching on his drug abuse, his [depression] fuelled thoughts of suicide, his rocky relationship with his son's mother -- and more. I was rocking this on shuffle (by accident) and listening to this joint first left me in awe of how honest/open he was, without seeming phony. He reminisces back to his pre-fatherhood life on the track \"Oldies, \" and gets busy on a super bassy [almost screwed] Mary J Blige sample on \"505 Flows.\" He hits his stride on the vibed out Outro -- which sports production reminiscent of the early solo days of Erick Sermon.\n\nHonesty, substance, realness, bars and hella bass -- that's what this EP delivers. With only two years in, Geoffrodamus shows some great promise and a good ear for production. Keep this kid on your radar -- and we'll be sure to keep you up to date on his latest ish as it becomes available.\n\nEarly.\n\n<iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/playlists/236680445&color=ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false\" width=\"100%\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"no\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe>",

    "content_html": "A new album came across my desk today — all the way from Bridgeport Connecticut. Member of the DertGang, which is an affiliated off-shoot of Dirtbag Clothing [a brand that gained notoriety earlier this year due to a <a href=\"http://www.thefader.com/2016/05/24/dertbag-streetwear-kanye\">Kanye West cosign</a>], Ty Mack delivers The Warm, a twelve-song slice of Bridgeport funk. The project is funky melting pot of bars, and thick hazy bass; it’s a long drive through the sticks in a Cadillac with the windows down, while puffing the stickiest dank. \n\nProduction wise, the album has three distinct lanes: contemporary trapping, southside pimping, and jazzy hip-hop. The BPM stays low and lazy, so the vibe is consistent, never jarring. Off the top, on the almost Mad-Lib-esque first track, \"Brazilians & Millions,\" Ty sets the tone for the project, with bully bars like “You all hype; I don’t feel that — homie this is real rap.” In all honesty, the song I felt the least affinity towards was “Sally,” which is a bass canon that doesn’t seem to have the same character that the other joints have. He gets on his 90s hip-hop shit on tracks like the sax-driven \"Smoke Break (Roll Up),” and the East Coast sounding T.H.L [an acronym for The High Life]; and songs like “S.T.R.T,” and acronym for \"Something To Ride To,” and \"No Crumbs” almost put me in the mind of the 1996 Luniz album <em>Operation Stackola</em>.  \n\nThis is music to ride to -- and a perfect addition to any of your summer movements. It was my introduction to Ty Mack, who is a little bit closed off as an artist [on social media, anyways]. All of his accounts are private. That only adds to his mystique, though. The Warm initially dropped a year ago, so I'm a little late to the party, but he's just earned a spot on the AAHH watch. We heard a rumor he has some new heat coming soon. Bonus points, he has a chopped and screwed version of the album, for when you get extra lit.\n\nEarly.   \n\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"450\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/playlists/85550766&color=ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false\"></iframe>\n\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"450\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/220928082&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true\"></iframe>",

    "content_html": "<blockquote>\"That's my goal. To be known for something different. I want to be a pioneer in my field, of my generation.\"\n--Skiggz</blockquote>\n[dropcap]P[/dropcap]eople love a good \"follow your dreams\" story -- and as such, it's a common theme in many movies and children's stories. If you're a hip-hop head, it's also the common thread that many of the younger artists of today share. Unlike golden era artists, a lot of the younger rappers have seen artists reach astronomical highs. Hence, the idea that 'you can do this too, just believe' is prevalent. For some, though, that allure is just too strong; it's consuming, and -- if they follow their hearts -- leads listeners on facing ting journeys. Logic is one example, and another is a young artist named Skiggz, who's album <i>The Valley Of Conduction</i> made its way across my desk today. At a hefty 18-tracks long, it's one year labor of love from a young artist who left his hometown of Indiana to move to the deserts of Phoenix, Arizona, to [take advantage of a chance opportunity] and pursue his passion, hip-hop.\n\nWhat he delivers is an odyssey that reads as both a celebration of his dream-chasing, and an open letter that address his haters and loved ones simultaneously. Each song reads as a milestone on his year-long cross-country journey, which he describes lovingly as \"Telling a story without telling a story. He kicks off the project with a blunted expedition across the desert, \"Lewis & Clark.\" He then gives us more insight into his origins on the -- oddly endearing -- \"Carry On.\" As he explains, his father always wanted him to carry on and not get carried away; however, the allure of seeing what else is out there, and living with the 'what if' was too powerful. He drops a powerful gem when he says, \"If you make the move, you better find a way to prove it.\" That one line sums up how this album felt, to me. Proving to himself, and everyone else, that he has what it takes.\n\nThe album seems incredibly honest, with Skiggz not being afraid to be an open book, and commit to the process. As he explains, \"I got all the major keys in there.\" His track, \"I Been,\" feat. Digitz, is an example of how candid he gets. The song [is a dis record] to rapper ESP, with whom [they] had a heavy falling out with during the course of the year. ESP, a longtime friend from the mid-west, was one of the two features on the project -- and the fact that Skiggz details a falling out with him, while also featuring his vocals on the project is pretty real, TBH.\n\n<i>The Valley Of Conduction</i> is a dope listen; it's personal without being polarizing, and as individual as his experience, his journey along the road to whatever he perceives his top to be is heavily relatable. Amidst some dope sound beds, and with a cadence that almost sounds like a mixture of Young Sinatra, Logic, blended with J.Cole, the project is easy to enjoy -- and worth a spot on your weekend playlist. It was Skiggz himself that says you can't improve if you don't have anything to prove. Well, on this LP he sounds hungry like he has everything to prove. Bonus points, it has extremely dope cover art.\n\n<iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/playlists/234832042&color=ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false\" width=\"100%\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"no\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe>",

    "content_html": "<blockquote>“It’s been tough to be a Gucci friend, a Gucci sibling, a Gucci girlfriend or a Gucci partner. I done took people through a lot, man.”\n—Gucci Mane; New York Times</blockquote>\nOl' Dirty Bastard wasn't -- by any means -- the most lyrical rapper out there. In fact, much of his most revered material was [allegedly] written by Method Man and GZA. However, that doesn't matter. That's not why we loved ODB. He was a character, who had an undeniable charisma that exploded on records. That's how I often feel about Gucci Mane; not to say, though, that Gucci doesn't have bars. But, he's a larger than life personality -- mythical even -- who's been through one of the most storied emotional roller coaster rides in recent hip-hop history. Not unlike Britney, who very publicly had a meltdown, shaving her hair, Guop 'lost his noodles,' as Waka Flocka put it. He was burning bridges like a human torch, catching back to back cases and -- most famously -- getting the most regrettable face tattoo in the game. He also, though, shot and killed one of the assassins that attempted to murder him during a home invasion over a decade ago. That level of brazenness is enough to drive anyone more than a little bit over the edge.\n\nThis was, though, mostly due to his personal demons, which were drugs and alcohol. All the money and fame that the 'Trap God' has amassed from his high profile features and catalogue of bangers orchestrated by his day one producers was helping to fund his downward spiral. This was starting to take a toll on his career and his bodily frame. It [legit] looked like he was about to give birth to twins. In the infamous episode of Noisy's ATL [hip-hop] documentary series, it's famously noted that Guop consistently goes from jail to the studio -- call it a tradition. Something was different this time, though. Gucci's rock bottom (usually) seemed to crumble under him and reveal another dark drop to a rocker rock bottom. But his most recent stint in the box appeared to be his actual bottom. The result: we have a whole new Gucci Mane. Clean, focused, and ripped. \n\nLast night he revealed <em>Everybody Looking</em>, a fifteen-track manifesto to his new found lease on life -- and a subtle narcissistic salute to himself. He sounds fresh, sharper [lyrically] and oddly hungry/arrogant as he glides over soundscapes orchestrated by long-time collaborators Zaytoven and Mike Will. The title seems fitting, as all eyes have been on the trap god since he dropped his [quite literal] \"First Day Out The Feds.\" He's released a handful of [the album's] tracks previously, but as a cohesive listen, this album goes. The album only features three guests throughout, but they are from Kanye, Young Thug, and Drake -- no biggie.\n\nHe admitted to the New York Times that he hadn't been (this) sober since his teens, \"I didn't think I could make music sober; I didn't think I could [enjoy] money sober.\" Well, it's a new day. This is far from the aggressive, violent Gucci we'd come to know -- and on a certain level -- appreciate. This is a new Gucci; one who's easier to ride with, and one who seems poised to live up to the potential we all see in him. Listening to this album was [thematically like] listening to the late Tupac's verse on the iconic \"California Love.\" As he states on the chorus to \"First Day Out The Fed,\" \"I bend but don't break, don't ask I take.\" Let's hope the last decade has made him stronger.\n\nWelcome back, Guop.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9kJJ9yhXNc",

Born in St. Louis, Missouri, he self-describes as different and unpredictable – two adjectives that are entirely accurate, especially after we took a watch/listen to his new single and video, “True.”\n\nStylistically, EJ is a strange brew – that is for sure. He sounds like a blend on B.O.B and Flo Rida [sonically] and has a physical look/style that comes off as a thematic mix of Lil’ Yachty, Andre 3000, and more. To explain, he delivers a catchy, singsong chorus that gets [all the way up] into your cranium, and parks there for a few days. The verses themselves, though, are more complicated. It’s a fresh experience. The video itself start off with a definition of being, true. This seems to suggest that a good portion of the threats/claims you may hear are in fact real talk, and should be heeded accordingly.\n\nLeading up to his [2015] debut album <em>Notorious</em>, EJ built a name and following with his [R$F] crew, releasing two mixtapes that generated over 10K downloads each [as of late 2014]. He also developed a live show that led to him opening for up for fast-rap legend Twista, Snow Tha Product, Caskey, and Shady Records signee, Yelawolf. In a sea of mediocracy and an overabundance of clones, EJ Carter stands out. Cor what’s next!

    "content_html": "<blockquote>\"I don't want to be known as just a \"rapper,\" I want to be more than that.\" —Meechi Blanco</blockquote>\n[dropcap]A[/dropcap] new project came across my desk today; State College, Pennsylvania, rapper Meechi Blanco is youthful, clever, nerdy, and all types of dope. He describes his debut [Soundcloud] release, good, as the dopest project we'll ever hear. That's a pretty loaded statement, but it is an incredible entry to the young rapper. Sitting at twelve tracks long, it has [only one] feature, no filler, and tons of bars.\n\nWhat immediately comes through is the youthful energy of the project. He seems to capture that essence you may find with contemporary trap/cloud rappers like OG Maco for example, but with the substance, the knob turned up and then broken off and thrown into the brush outside the house. Over incredible production like the slow-flow \"Walter Blanco,\" the dark -- almost Wu-ish -- \"Play My Tape Bitch,\" or the neck snapping \"Creed,\" which was sadly way too short, Meechi shines. Some highlights are the spacey \"Trip,\" featuring vocals by DoctorWeedFairy, and the super hungry flow on \"Piss Excellence.\"\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=els_dJLxCtY\n\nMeechi is a one-man show -- from the engineering to the cover art. \"I don't necessarily need to be rich, I just want to be able to do what I love to do and live comfortably,\" he says humbly. That doesn't seem unreasonable; he sits outside the box, not so much by innovating per-say, but excelling by sticking to the basics. That's hard to explain, and not as easy as it sounds. good, though, is -- in the end -- an ironic title, because this album is more than that. He's relishing in the accomplishment, but not stopping to let the dust settle – he's already working on two follow-up projects scheduled to release in 2017. Stay tuned to Meechi!\n\nEarly.\n\n<iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/playlists/235095872&color=ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false\" width=\"100%\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"no\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe>",

    "content_html": "<blockquote>Unbiased, unfiltered; an educated unity that can lead everyone to a greater good. Hip-hop can do that! Hip-hop HAS done that.</blockquote>\n[dropcap]T[/dropcap]he old saying goes if you stand for nothing, you fall for everything. Hip-hop was once a weapon -- and not metaphorically, either. It was an underdog that rallied like minds together in an unprecedented way that was simultaneously feared and admired by the establishment. Whether challenging the social system that oppressed a large portion of the underprivileged, attacking [perceived] social injustice, or breathing relevance into ills that existed within urban communities hip-hop [often] called for awareness, change, and -- above all -- unity.\n\nKRS-ONE, for example, used his well-earned platform to educate about the <a href=\"https://youtu.be/f9KKAoLO3rc\">history of African culture</a>, shine a spotlight on the <a href=\"https://youtu.be/kJXYsZKmuVQ\">illicit activity</a> of supposed \"powers that be,\" and provide an <a href=\"https://youtu.be/snUht1LQ5nU\">unbiased education on the roots of racism in America</a>. Public Enemy, as well, focused on the deep-rooted sense of [black] self, helped popularize Minister Farrakhan, and -- <a href=\"https://youtu.be/abxI7Q4KC4s\">according to Russell Simmons</a> -- Chuck D had an [inspirational] hand in making the monumental Million Man March happen. Golden Era hip-hop [on a whole] had a number of large-scale \"campaigns.\" BDP spearheaded the<i>Stop The Violence</i> movement that brought together the biggest voices in the game (which oddly/ironically) included Eazy-E, also, the <i>H.E.A.L</i> movement, which focused on the 'healing' of inner city communities plagued with [numerous] issues not limited to violence and rampant drug abuse. Another example is <i>America Is Dying Slowly</i>, a musical piece aimed at raising awareness about the rise in AIDS in America.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/s6drAemArvM\n\nHip-hop was an unquenchable flame -- and once it's commercial appeal was fully embraced and realized, it became big business; unfortunately, this came at the cost of substance. Today, we're seeing a rise in documented [police] violence, horrific social injustice, and a political crossroad more stark than we've ever experienced. Yet, some of the culture's biggest and brightest voices have marbles in their mouths, and would rather pander to commercial radio than risk ostracizing their industry status, and overly lavish lifestyles. When we [AAHIPHOP] recently polled out Twitter followers, 75% felt that these artists had a responsibility to use their platforms for the greater good -- to speak out about what's happening and influence discussion/change.\n\nI don't want to create that illusion that there aren't revolutionary voices, though. Killer Mike, for example, is stepping out from behind the mic, and encouraging <a href=\"https://youtu.be/AF5ad3SGzGM\">the black community to support their own [businesses]</a>, and strengthen unity at an individual level. As well, many artists, have openly supported movements like #BlackLivesMatter and poured millions into charities that support many notable causes. I'm just wondering when we'll see 30 of the highest selling artists get together on record to provide clear [unbiased] direction and leadership, together -- unified. Think Tidal, but with a far less self-serving mantra than how much money artists receive from album streams. Openly supporting popular movements and hashtags on Twitter or wearing [social activist] shirts is one thing, but organizing a million people to assemble and peacefully demonstrate is another. I'm nothing thinking macro like \"<a href=\"https://youtu.be/WkZ5e94QnWk\">Fuck Trump</a>,\" I'm thinking larger scale, like a let's challenge a system that would force a vote for a lesser of two evils rather than strong candidates -- free of questionable/objectionable actions or thinking. Instead of \"<a href=\"https://youtu.be/Z7-TTWgiYL4\">Fuck The Police</a>,\" how about, let's celebrate and support the good officers who work hard to protect their communities and put themselves at risk daily to provide for their families, not unlike firefighters or soldiers.\n\nLet's topple those who think the opposite, and work to build up and elect regional and municipal officials who will prosecute \"bad officers\" to the fullest extent of the law -- and finally bring justice to families who have suffered unimaginable loss. Unbiased, unfiltered; an educated unity that can lead everyone to a greater good. Hip-hop can do that! Hip-hop HAS done that.\n\nThis time [in history] is ripe for the next generation to make a mark so cultural significant that a quasi-jaded head like me will write about it thirty years from now -- and call for similar social accountability from artists that are prevalent in that era. Let's smarten up, get together, and organize.\n\nLet's do this.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/gTsIpZ_Si3A\n\nhttps://youtu.be/mPCHG2VB4Hc\n\nhttps://youtu.be/8PaoLy7PHwk",

His style reeks of the 90's -- in the best of ways. Old school jazz, hip hop, and contemporary bass lines playfully intermingle to make nothing less than bangers. As of late, he's been making music with other [Orcutt-local] artists such as Vuvu Le, gruga, Wepz, oc;Ma, and others. Together they're creating a gradually growing collective of [like minded] musicians, the OnesUpAffiliates. They're spreading messages of love and fluidity, and working feverishly to get the music to the masses. \"If someone told me that they didnt like my music, at the very least it means they listened to it. Everyone should have the opportunity to hear good music, so we push to give everyone the chance to hear our version of it,\" says Tyrelle coily. \n\nIf you're a real head, you'll definitely want to give him a listen. For now, get to know him a little better in the Q&A he recently did with our staff.\nMy most notable releases as of yet, are the 'ooWee EP' and the most recent 'tyrelle[tape]' . I am currently working on a new concept album style mix of all original music. Being that progression is the intention, i plan to put alot of work into the coming release so it will drop late September.\n\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"450\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https://api.soundcloud.com/tracks/274974960&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true\"></iframe>\n\n<b>What do you want listeners to take away from your beats?</b>\n\nWhat I want people to take away from my music is the motion of love. I try to make music that slips you into a smooth state of chill as soon as the snare hits. I like to make stuff that just mellows things out. And I think a lot of people need that!\n\n<b>Ultimately, what's your [musical] career goal?</b>\n\nAn ultimate goal, I suppose, could be just to spread the sound. I believe what I push for the most is to spread the music to the most people I possibly can. I want everyone in the world to hear what I'm making. If I love something that I make, it means that someone else could love it too! Why would I keep it to myself if it sounds nice?\n\n<b>What's coming up next for you?</b>\n\nThere is alot coming up. Taking things day by day of course, but as of right now working on getting a OnesUpAffiliates website up and running very soon. There you'll be able to find music, Otown photos, artist bios, merchandise, contact info, links, tons of stuff. Also working on getting merchandise produced. \n\n<b>Any visuals or shows we can look forward to?</b>\n\nMusic videos are in the editing stages right now. Performances at 'Le Disco' a U•N•I event in mid-August, as well as the following event held by the same collective in early January of the coming year. The second of these two events will be hosting an 'Otown Stage' which will exclusively showcase Orcutt artists such as myself, Jslv, Vuvu Le, Wepz, and perhaps more.",

Let me pay some kids tuitions, straight up! —Young Skrilla\"</blockquote>\n24-year-old Valley-born rapper and aspiring philanthropist, Young Skrilla, spent a lot of time [in his formidable years] in both New Orleans and southern music Mecca, Houston; two cities whose roots have had a profound influence on his sound. He self-classifies as a disciple of the 'New Wave' sound -- but cautions that he spends a great of time thinking of good lyrics, and not just whatever sounds \"good\" with auto-tune. \"I like to make the [bar-area] Cali music, sometimes some H-Town shit, sometimes the real shit, and sometimes the hype music. Sometimes, I just do it all at once,\" says Skrilla when describing his sound.\n\nWhile working hard in the studio, Skrilla recently took a few minutes out to chat with AAHIPHOP about his music, his influences, and what he has on the horizon.\n\nCheck out his latest visuals, and peep the interview below!\n\nhttps://youtu.be/wgzRCP6gDdo\n\n<b>How'd you get wrapped up in music?</b>\n\nI was remixing Tupac songs when I was younger and -- for some reason -- I had the gift to learn songs very fast. I was rapping some shit I probably didn't understand at the time [laughs]. My very first purchase was a Memphis Bleek CD that I'd bump every morning going to school.\nStarted messing around with the mic at 17 or 18-years old. I was told by a fellow rapper [by the name of Young Zilla] that I had potential and should take it seriously. I had heard the word Skrilla being used when I went to school in Mississippi; that's where that came from.\n\n<b>Who influenced your music?</b>\n\nMy influences musically aren't what you'd expect.  I used to -- and still do -- listen to a lot of reggae; Rebelution to be exact. But, I'm not gonna lie and say I used to listen to the Jay-Z or NAS -- it was the old Weezy, Eminem, Kanye, Drake, and Kirko [Bangz]\n\n<b>What do you have floating around right now?</b>\n\nI haven't released anything official other than The Rise of a Pharaoh tape which sold a good amount of units but didn't hit iTunes or anything: so, mainly just videos and remixes on Soundcloud.\n\n<b>What do you have coming up?</b>\n\nCurrently working on finishing my first official EP -- it's still currently unnamed. But, I want to bring something new to the table. I want people [to be] unsure of where I'm from because the music doesn't classify me; they're just hits.\n\n<b>Tell about some of the achievements you're proud of this far.</b>\n\nBiggest achievements would have to be opening for J.Cole and building a great audience/following [considering where I'm from]. My YouTube views being 70k+ makes me feel some type way. Also, being in big studios like Soul Asylum in Atlanta, Georgia, or recording where the greats [record] in Houston, Texas.\n\n<b>What are your goals in this rap shit?</b> \n\nMy ultimate goal is to have a big enough platform to change people's minds about things.\nI wanna spend all my money on other people. I want to have fun -- no worries. I want to give more than I receive with a heart full of sincerity; fuck 20 chains and a Ferrari, bro. Let me pay some kids tuitions, straight up!",

    "content_html": "[dropcap]T[/dropcap]here are some co-signs that you just can't responsibly sleep on, as both a listener and -- in my case -- a writer. It's easy sometimes to dismiss vitality of an artist, similar to what I've chosen to do with acts like Madeintyo for example. But, Divine Council is another story; the foursome of Lord Linco, Cyrax, $ilkMoney, and ICY TWAT -- all from the Richmond, VA, area [except ICY who is from Chicago] seem to have an undeniable buzz. With a shoutout on Erykah Badu's Twitter, a personal endorsement from André 3000, and deal with Epic under the tutelage of LA fricking Reid, who brought acts like Usher, TLC, Ciara, and Outkast to prominence, it's unlikely that these kids won't be the next big thing.\n\nFor the most part, their image hinges on a few key ingredients: obscurity, mystery, nostalgia, humor, and consistency. Their recent EP <i>Council World</i> seems well developed -- it serves as both an introduction and a catch-up on what some of us have been sleeping on. It's filled with a combination of dark synths, \"Über-Everywhere-esque\" spacious sound beds, Midwest slang, and a dash of nerdery. The first track on the EP, for example, \"P.Sherman,\" is a reference to the address where Nemo [Finding Nemo] was taken in the blockbuster animated film. There's nothing kiddie about that song, or the project, though. For a reminder of that, check out their super NSFW website, which is brilliant. These guys come across like the bad kids in your class; you know, the ones all the ladies loved.\n<blockquote><i>\"Tisk, tisk, tisk, to the kids who get lifted /Dropping out of classes, just so we could hit switches /Beating niggas asses, giving stitches to snitches...\"</i></blockquote>\nSongs like \"Can't Afford Me\" and [the already popular] \"Rolie Polie Olie\" really show off their commercial appeal. In fact -- the taunts of \"I got the formula,\" on \"Can't Afford Me,\" come off more factual than they appear. The other three tracks although dope, seem aimed at their core fanbase; new fans can come for those above and stay for the rest.\n\nMy fave track here was the last one, \"Dick On A Dope.\" Simply put -- it was the closest to the hip-hop of yesteryear [IMO], and -- bar wise -- $ilkMoney goes in. I'm older, sue me.\n\nOverall, the five-songs feel like an appetizer to something that some of the most respect names in the industry already know is \"it.\" If you've been on the fence or dragging your heels about getting into the group, change that now -- or else be a D rider later when they pop. A legion of devout fans can't be wrong!\n\nWord to LA Reid!\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=syoI5pwIpNg\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U43JACL5nPM\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r6BFeO8ig3g\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W81kjiFGtqE",

Building on their last piece, \"Shinin'\" is an atmospheric, moody song that you may imagine as a backdrop to a slow-motion training montage for the Rio Olympics, or a Nike commercial. This time, though, they have a guest -- the G.O.O.D Music head honcho King Push, more commonly known as Pusha T. Push has been making a lot of noise thus far in 2016, with <em>Darkest Before Dawn: The Prelude</em> [which dropped in December] picking up steam. He shines [no pun intended] with his trademark dealer-bars: \"BET, wanna see how I'm living? Well, come on in we ain't gotta leave the kitchen.\" The feature is a [major] good look for the BC producer, and an exciting insight into what he has coming up.\n\nHe's been busy in the studio preparing a full-length that will feature a multitude of artists over his beats. If \"Shinin'\" is any indication of what he has in the stash, the project could prove to be quite successful for the Canadian-native. Stay tuned!\n\nhttps://soundcloud.com/mylesanthony/shinin-feat-pusha-t-and-ezra-kwizera",

It's a 14-minute journey through the eyes of the Michigan-native. He shares his thoughts, gives insight, and provides you with a dope [visual] amidst a lush soundtrack.\n\nThe video starts with a reflective monologue that describes not only his personal demons -- but the ills that seem to be engulphing communities and plaguing the minds of the youth. Amidst [high quality] night time visuals, there is an intense build up that works to hammer home the internal struggle the rapper deals with. This isn't a music video drawn out; although it does have a few prominent songs features -- but rather, an atmospheric blend of moody sounds that serve as more of a dope score than anything else.\n\nLook, man; we've been supporting Oneup2Lovett for a minute. The man has the skill, and \"TRU\" is another notch for him. Check it out below -- and also check out the super bumping \"Music,\" in case you missed it.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p_5UuJB6zkA",

    "content_html": "[dropcap]C[/dropcap]ame across a cool artist that I [somehow] slept on back in the day. He goes by the name Ace Lover, and he's been bubbling on the New York City [indie hip-hop] scene for a minute. The self-described \"hispanglish homeboy\" got his start as when he was 17 -- the MC, battle rapper, and street artist released two 12\" records that made some noise. I should also not downplay that he is a <i>serious</i> battle head; in fact, If I'm not mistaken he was heavy on the Braggin' Rites scene. He even battled the late PH in his heyday (check out this <a href=\"https://youtu.be/_GMtGu5Yobo\">Vast Aire record they both appeared on</a>). After leaving his [Music Family] imprint and signing with the Fat Beat distributed Cajo Communications, he released some records with rapper Oktober under the collective guise, <a href=\"https://youtu.be/KHOjNkwhKWI\">2for5</a>. During this time (the early 00's), he toured US and Canada and was even named one of the next 100 upcoming artists to look out for by URB magazine.\n\nHis last release, which was 2015's self-titled Ace Lover, he dropped a stack of what he calls \"visual music art\" videos. His love of the arts, though, has seemed to bubble to the forefront this year, as this year is his contemporary art coming out -- so to speak -- after years of paying dues on the street art scene. On top of his [first] exhibition, he launched a pop-up shop where you can cop some of his pieces.\"\n\nHe has a unique catalogue, and -- if you're not familiar with him --he's worth checking out, especially if you're a lover of straight up bred-in-NYC indie hip-hop! Start with his super dope record \"Amazing Brains,\" and binge on from there. You're welcome.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BB_CPmDJ-YI\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQiB4af0aFw\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VWOyifYOe4\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SNwv8XHS8l4",

That fact honestly didn't surprise us as we took in his latest album,<a href=\"https://www.google.ca/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0ahUKEwi3zqbkw8jOAhVYGGMKHVWzCbkQFggbMAA&url=https%3A%2F%2Fopen.spotify.com%2Falbum%2F3KUVXoayEUSK6RGiIKam2l&usg=AFQjCNEAEvIWSBy2k83VMs_578lXiC-fKQ&bvm=bv.129759880,d.eWE\"> <i>My Last Year Broke</i></a>, which sounds anything like an album by a new jack. It's carefully calculated, crafted, and baked to perfection. The eleven-song effort simultaneously highlights his own game, his world music influence, his love of the genre, and his ear for the sound currently dominating the [mainstream] music industry.\n\nRelatable. Boastful. Arrogant. Hip-Hop. Bassy rider music, like \"Been On\" and the project opener \"Sé Lot,\" is balanced by breezy laid back vibes like \"Soar\" and the project highlight, \"Miami Vice,\" ripe with a jazzy Spanish-Harlem-esque sound bed.\n\nMikey seems to have his shit sonically together -- this album is a must-listen this week. The title, and some of the bars have a very presumptuous vibe to it; or perhaps he knows something he isn't telling us yet. Either way, we'll have our eyes peeled for his next move.

    "content_html": "[dropcap]I[/dropcap]ndie. Quirky. Unique. Those are just a few ways that one may choose to describe singer and songwriter Shelita Burke. For the last few months, she's been constantly popping up on my radar, and having taken some time to catch up, and learn more about her; it's easy to see why! She was on NPR's list of artists that I need to keep on my radar and -- as well -- that MTV artist status that artists seem to brag about in their press releases all the time? Yeah, she's ranked in the top 10. Needless to say, there's something about her that is clicking with listeners. Her first EP, <i>Transfixed</i>, is a mellow, acoustic vibe that highlight her hauntingly unique voice and personal songwriting. As a sidebar, It also reached #14 on Amazon's top music chart. She almost -- but not quite -- puts me in the mind of Corinne Baily Rae, only slightly from a cadence perspective.\n\nHer grind is incredible; I'd be remiss not to mention that. She's been touring overseas; playing self-generated dates in France, Japan, Canada, Wales, and more. This globetrotter perspective [and residing in both Paris and LA] has been slowly amalgamating with her sound, and her upcoming EP, Five, seems to pick up where her first EP left off, with an EDM-infused remix of the title track. She's leading the new project, which will be available this October, with the single \"Belong,\" super cool track I spent the last few sweaty summer evenings listening to on repeat.\n\nWhat's unique about her is that there's this certain [je be c'est quoi] about her music that you're unable to put your finger on until you explore her liner notes; she's been experimenting with Autonomous Sensory Meridian Response (ASMR). She explains it as \"a pleasurable tingling 'brain tickle' effect. She -- consequently -- incorporates unique vocal runs into her music that give listeners what she calls “brain orgasms.\" Her quirky vocals make love to your mind; tell me that isn't the most unique thing you've ever heard! I dare you.\n\nHer new EP was produced by Bellringer, a wildly successful producer whose worked with the likes of Diddy, Nicki Minaj, Usher, and Britney Spears -- not to mentions brands like McDonald's. She's in good hands. The first single is an exciting look at what we have to look forward to this October. In the meantime, get familiar with her work -- Shelita Burke is an artist who is worth your time. If you don't believe NPR, and the legion of fans who've helped her climb the ranks as an MTV artist -- or even the fans she's earned one by one around the world on tour -- then believe me. She's a name you'll hear about -- sooner than later.\n\n<iframe style=\"border: 0; width: 100%; height: 120px;\" src=\"https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/track=1141583185/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/tracklist=false/artwork=small/transparent=true/\" seamless=\"\">&lt;a href=\"http://shelitaburke.bandcamp.com/track/belong\"&gt;Belong by Shelita Burke&lt;/a&gt;</iframe>\n\nhttps://youtu.be/T6lAeY87gxc",

    "content_html": "<blockquote>\"We're trying to put Ohio back on the map musically...hip-hop wise.\"\n--Vice Souletric</blockquote>\n[dropcap]I[/dropcap]t was an evening early last month when I received a cold-call -- if you will -- from an Ohio-based rapper named Vice Souletric. A quick peruse of his SoundCloud revealed an impressive amount of quality material and features, which I directly correlate with cosigns. Ones that immediately jumped out at me were \"Respect The Legends,\" produced by the iconic 9th Wonder, \"Stayin' Out The Way,\" featuring the BK rapper Skyzoo, and \"Return Of The Blackman,\" featuring Talib Kweli. Alongside his partner in rhyme, G.Huff, the two have formed an on-wax chemistry similar to Cuban Linx-era Ghostface and Raekwon. With premieres on platforms like Okayplayer, and most recently Revolt, the two seem to be making a tonne of moves at an accelerated rate.\n\nAside from rap, Vice is also an accomplished [visual] artist and producer. The latter he attributes to sheer necessity; \"I couldn't find anybody who made the type of beats that I like, so I learned how to make beats myself. Being from Ohio, it's crazy because a lot of cats around here aren't necessarily on that East Coast boom bap type of feel, but that's what I like, so I had to teach myself how to make type of beats.\" His cover artwork also led to him forming a relationship with producer Pete Rock, whom he's considered a mentor over the past 3-4 years. With their biggest release yet, Vice and Huff [finally] released a song produced by Chocolate Boy Wonder, \"Bills,\" with a visual expected to follow shortly.\n\nWith two knocking mixtapes under his belt, and tonnes of exciting things in the pipeline, I decided to take some time to sit with Vice and learn more about his process, his music, and more. Check out the new song, \"Bills,\" and the interview below.\n\nhttps://soundcloud.com/g-huff-330/bills-ft-vice-souletric-prod-by-pete-rock\n\n<hr>\n\n<strong>One thing that stuck out when I went through your stuff is that you had some pretty heavy features. Give me a sense of how you got involved with some of these people?</strong>\n\nOver the last two years, I dropped two projects. One was an EP called <em>Vice for President</em>. On there, I was able to work with Guilty Simpson and Reks from Boston. Then this last project, <a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/vicebeats\"><em>Vice for President 2</em></a>, was a full-length EP. I was able to work with Kweli, Skyzoo, 9th Wonder, and Rapper Big Pooh. A lot of times people do ask me a lot, like \"Wow, how did you get to work with these cats?\" It's nothing more than stepping to these cats in a business manner -- keeping it completely professional. Handling my business the way that they want to handle it. To be honest with you, I'm not personally friends with any of these cats; I had to hit up their management. I had to hit them up directly to see what they were talking about and just had to network. If I had to break off some bread, I did that; in some cases, I didn't have to do that. But, at the end of the day, it's just about building the best mutual respect, and I think all those cats have respect for me. I've got respect for them.\n\n<strong>Did they give you feedback on the joints?</strong>\n\nOh yeah, definitely. All the cats that I worked with gave me feedback. One of the cats that I collaborated with that I didn't have direct contact with was 9th Wonder, though. I collaborated with King Magnetic on that track, and he has a direct relationship with 9th. So as far as that beat, he pretty much worked with 9th on that, but as far as everybody else, I heard back from them, and they gave me good feedback. They liked the tracks; and you know, a lot of times with these cats, it doesn't matter what the terms are, they're not going to be a part of something that they're not feeling.\n\n<strong>Your latest joint on Vevo with Hi-Tek -- how did that come together?</strong>\n\nWith that situation, that track is part of G.Huff's album, and I'm featured on the song. We had to go [hard] for the longest, with us being from Ohio, to be able to reach out to Hi-Tek, and it was just something where we reached out to him on Facebook. We presented our music to him; we told him who we are, what we were trying to do, and it took a while -- because Hi-Tek isn't a cat that just works with anybody. So it took a while to crack that nut, but he eventually responded back to us like, \"Yeah, let's work,\" and he sent us a few beats. It was very hard to pick the one beat that we wanted to use, but you know, we're happy with it, and he liked the song. Like after the video came out and everything, he hit us up; he gave us our blessing, like \"Yeah, that's dope.\" We intend on doing some more work with Hi-Tek in the future.\n\n<strong>Alright, so you guys are indie right now, yeah?</strong>\n\nWe're indie, man. Everything. It's like I'm a producer, I naturally write my music, I'm a graphic designer, I do all my covers, websites, all of that stuff, man. Like, we're pretty much a one stop shop. We take care of all of our business because, one, you need to be able to do that, just to cut costs, because it's very expensive trying to do music. Two, it gives you more leverage when you're trying to network and work with other people -- being able to wear more hats. So yeah, we're completely indie. We would like to get signed, that would be ideal, but right now we're indie, and we're happy with our position.\n\n<strong>Have you had any interest from labels? Have you talked to labels?</strong>\n\nWe're just in the beginning stages. To be honest with you, we've been doing it for a while, but just over like the last year and a half, people have been starting to take notice of what we've been doing. We buckled down and started releasing these projects that we put a lot of time, a lot of effort, a lot of resources into. But we are getting more interest by the day from different A&Rs, we're connecting with a lot of different people in the industry, and they're looking at us. As of right now, we haven't had a contract pushed in our face yet, but with the moves that we've made, and a couple of things we have in the works, we're expecting something to pop by the end of 2016, for sure.\n\n<strong>Who are some of the artists that maybe you haven't worked with yet, or that you wanted to get on this project, that you're going to try to get in the future?</strong>\n\nWell, one is Pete Rock. Like I have a joint on Vice President 2 called 'Irap', and like I know him personally -- and I want him to rap on the song. Like I didn't even want a beat, I just wanted him to rap, because the song is all about being a producer and an MC, so I thought it would be great to have him on it. It wasn't able to go down because he was really busy working on this project he has coming out with Smoke Dza. But actually, Huff and I were just down there this past weekend, and we hooked up with him, and we got a beat from him. We're going to be releasing a joint with Pete Rock real soon. It's gonna be crazy; it's gonna be nuts, man. [Editor's Note: The song has since been released, it's called \"Bills.\"]\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-wpvYAdN6I8\n\n<strong>You’ve been friends with him for quite a while, and you consider him sort of a mentor. Maybe talk a little bit about that relationship.</strong>\n\nI would say maybe for like the last four or five years; he's a real cool cat. Like, he's a cat that interacts with people via social media, so we've always interacted online, and actually like I said, I do graphic design, so I did a cover for him. If you remember the project that he did with Camp Lo\nmaybe about two or three years ago, he had like this cartoon type cover - I did that. I'm the one that did that joint, so that's sort of how we linked. It was real crazy. He hit me up in the middle of the night, dude. He hit me up, because he got my number from Huff, and he hit me up in the middle of the night with like 20 text messages. I wake up to all these messages from Pete Rock, talking about, \"Yo, I need a cover.\" So I did the cover man, and ever since then we kept in contact. You know we talk sports, we talk hoops; we talk music every once in a while. He has a mutual respect for us, but we never try to be too thirsty with him, and like beg him for beats, this that and the other. Everything has to happen in its own time, and you know, now it's time, so we about to get it cracking.\n\n<strong>So what's next? What's the next project we can look out for?</strong>\n\nWhat I'm working on now is an instrumental album. Because I put out the two projects that I was rapping on, and I just want to showcase like the beats, and let people know like how serious I am, and how into the production I am, and how detailed I am with it. So that's the next thing coming out, that's probably going to be dropping within the next two months, and it's not going to be throwaway beats either. Like I already told my boys in my crew, \"Y'all gonna be pissed when y'all hear some of the beats I put on this because I'm putting out heat.\" Because, no matter what you release, you've always got to put your best foot forward, and I want people to take me seriously as a producer as well, so that's the next thing that's coming out.\n\n<strong>Any last words, or anything else you'd like to leave on the blog?</strong>\n\nPretty much, man, just check out <a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/vicebeats\"><em>Vice for President 2</em></a>, and check me out on vicesworld.com -- that's my website. You can find all my social media up there. We are just trying to represent Ohio, man. Like this is a big year for Ohio, but we're trying to put Ohio back on the map musically, hip-hop wise, so by the end of 2016 man, we're just gonna try to be in the position that we want to be in.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9QX7o0HiVo",

    "content_html": "[dropcap]I[/dropcap]t's summertime; that means time for rolling with the top down, sweaty afternoons cruising the metropolis, and -- of course -- summer love. Whether it's [literally] an affair that will fade with the change with the season, or endure the harsh winter climate, it still has one thing in common; it's a roller coaster of emotion. The feeling is perfectly encapsulated by Toronto singer/rapper ElceeTheArtist, and electro producer Bonham Carter, whose new EP -- <em><a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/elceetheartist\">Love Notes</a></em> -- is the new soundtrack for your seasonal emotions. Across the concise five-song effort, the duo craft a sound that is not wholly unique, but the consistent tone that can loosely be considered conceptual.\n\nFrom the onset, Elcee describes universal love-at-first-sight insecurities on the EP opener \"Karma Cafe,\" and drops some relationship hints on \"The Little Things,\" where he describe the minute details he strives to pick up on as he gets to know his lady friend a bit better. Any woman will tell you that's a major key. Overall, he paints the many angles of a relationship, over a flowy sound bed that could have just as well been the product of a west coast influence, with hints of early 2000 Neptune's synths splashed in for added cool factor.\n\nThe more [arguably] sexy vibes he drops on the project closer, \"Drunkk,\" closely resemble a dude version of Queen B's smash Drunk In Love. My fave track was \"Sorry,\" which is sums up the universal plight of the working artist -- the girl or the music. The song suggests that he chose music, ironically in an effort to keep the girl.\n\nElcee and Bonham deliver a solid effort more than worth a spot on your long-weekend end of summer playlist.

It also spawned a series of compilations and even a TV show. Wordsworth, who notably appeared not only in the live showcase but also the MTV show, has also worked with artists like Mos Def and Talib Kweli (Blackstar), A Tribe Called Quest, and more. So, it's a good look for Trew, who's features have been very impressive thus far.\n\nTrew is currently working on a Hip-Hop/House project with Toronto DJ and producer Melanie Sutherland -- as well as eying a 2017 release date for his solo project. In the meantime, check the new single!\n\nhttps://soundcloud.com/flyneverdies/fly-never-dies-cheers-featuring-wordsworth-x-jacob-lotto",

That's pretty big look -- just saying. \n\nRefusing to let the dust settle on the momentum he built with the last record, \"Big Leagues\" is anthemic, heavy, and palpably aggressive. With the right video treatment, it feels like the type of record that an athlete would jam while getting ready for a life changing match, fight, or game. In fact, he has a stack of dope tracks currently floating around. We're officially putting him on our watch list!

The culture has become a cash driven thing -- more driven by business and marketing plans than talent and raw, honest, emotional connection. Rapper Zeta is hoping to change that. With what he self-describes as a movie-scripted experience, he's taking hip-hop back to the roots.\n\nHis latest record, \"Overdose,\" is an atmospheric, guitar-driven, ballad worthy of a spot on your weekly playlist. His soulful rap/singing style rides the beat like an empty expressway -- and makes for a significant record. Keep an eye and ear on Zeta; matter of fact, check out his catalogue. For now, bump Overdose after the jump.\n\nhttps://soundcloud.com/zetaattlast/overdose",

    "content_html": "<blockquote>\"Clean up ya dirty money to good money; legal money last longer than drug money!\"\n-- Master P</blockquote>\n[dropcap]T[/dropcap]he undisputed entrepreneur and southern legend Master P -- who ironically started his career on the west coast -- was already riding high by the time that 1997 rolled around. His label No Limit, which evolved from a record store he had owned/operated in Richmond, California, was a magazine mainstay, booking out two pages at a time. He also scored a few regional hits alongside his brothers C-Murder and Silk The Shocker, collectively known as TRU, and had some notoriety after the release of his fifth solo endeavour, <em>Ice Cream Man</em>. It was with the release of the infamous <em>Ghetto D</em>, though, that the whole continent caught on to what the NO transplant was up to. Fuelled by the double-platinum lead single, \"Make Em' Say Ughh,\" the album was a game changer for not only P but his entire roster, which grew to its climax a few short years later.\n\nThe album was a rough, rugged, raw walk through [southern] inner-city life. From the title track, which included a vivid step-by-step manual on how to be a cocaine distributor, to the dramatic allusions to the rap industry as a form of reformation for drug dealers on \"I'm A Rider.\" Then, there was the heartfelt [lyrical] tears for the fallen on the project's second biggest single, \"I Miss My Homies,\" which was largely inspired by the death of his brother, Kevin. There were a few thug-love attempts -- those were, however, overshadowed by bassy funk-laced rider music that became the soundtrack of the southern massive.\n\nFollowing the album's success, the label saw solo efforts by many of its core artists, like Silk and Mystikal, push millions of units. P was even able to score Snoop Dogg during the weird limbo period after he left Death Row. In fact, that album stands as the highest selling from the imprint. The turn of the millennium saw the mighty tank sustain some heavy damage -- from the loss of major artists, the indefinite incarceration of C-Murder, and a decline in record sales. P eventually sold the catalogue and has since tried to reclaim his brand's glory days a few times -- to varying degrees of success. His son has sold millions of records, and appeared on television, and P himself still has a fortune of over $300 million to keep him warm at night. For fans of the rapper during the heydey of his iconic label, his music will always have a place in our hearts.\n\nAs we celebrate 19 years since the release of <em>Ghetto D</em>, we've decided to take a look back at some of the album's biggest records. Turn up, and take a walk down memory lane.\"Ughhhhhhh.\"\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URX26OSnfME\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5K3uF8IRar8\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQSHAfzU5ks",

    "content_html": "[dropcap]B[/dropcap]rooklyn, New York, has given birth to many successful upstarts over the years; mainly, as far as rap is concerned, \"street artists\" that are cut from the cloth of artists like Biggie, Kool G Rap, and others. BK-native PIFFMAN is one such artist -- a true street hip-hop head in every sense of the term. He worked his way up the ladder, burrowing his way into the local hierarchy on both the mixtape and [ever popular] DVD scene that seemed to flood the game about 6-7 years ago. Working with DJ's like Superstar Jay and the iconic blend master, Ron G, he began to make a name for himself. His big break, though, came when we collaborated with the wave God himself, Max B, on three tracks, \"Valentine's Day,\" \"In The Loop,\" and \"Never Let You Go.\" Max, who gained notoriety firstly for his affiliation and the beef with rapper Jim Jones and then his come up with Bad Boy artists French Montana, took PIFFMAN under his wing -- effectively giving him the exposure he needed to take his career to the next level. Unfortunately, though, the ride was cut short when Max was sentenced to a lengthy 75-year jail term on murder conspiracy and robbery charges, forcing PIFF to run on his own two feet; he soon flooded the street with the sounds of his certified street-hop anthem, \"Lotta Work, featuring MMG rapper Gunplay.\n\nWithout warning, Hurricane Sandy took hold of the East Coast, and in the process, PIFF lost everything; without a house, car -- and disposable income -- he travelled across the country to the sunny palm tree streets of LA, where to set up shop in the city's Korea town. He began shooting videos in Hollywood, which caught the attention LAHH star and multi-millionaire rapper Soulja Boy, who promptly tapped the rapper to work on some records -- one of which ended up becoming \"Ferrari,\" which sported a two million dollar video budget and over 2.7 million spins on World Star Hip Hop.\n\nNow, with PIFFMAN sitting in the spotlight, with a catalogue that includes songs with superstars like French Montana, he's hard at work on his new project, <em>Sippin & Surfin</em>, which features artists like Riff Raff, Wale, and much more. His latest record, \"Model Bitch,\" has already broken a cool million on SoundCloud, so apparently, the demand exists.\n\nLike French, PIFF has seemed to flourish post-Max B incarceration, amidst adversity -- and false starts. It's hard to imagine him failing; tune in, mash the follow button and put your money on a sure bet. Catch him on Riff Raff's Peach Panther tour in a city near you!\n\nEarly.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqpf-dUkc4s\n\nhttps://youtube.com/watch?v=a1u_ty1e1S0\n\nhttps://youtube.com/watch?v=Z65_FBajOoo\n\nhttps://youtube.com/watch?v=AHsl1wvYi60",

    "content_html": "<blockquote>\"Each musician contributed their [own] style to consolidate the sound we achieved.\" —Andres Marin.</blockquote>\n[dropcap]A[/dropcap]t its roots, hip-hop has always been -- at least ideologically-- and experimental genre. From the evolution of the \"get-down\" found on records that range from funk to world music, and the introduction of the scratch, some of the genre's most revered elements have derived from other forms of music and sound. This amalgamation of vibes was most prominent [commercially] during the golden era when groups like De La Soul and Tribe Called Quest brought jazzy loops to the forefront.\n\nIt's impossible not to feel the excitement, slight 90's hip-hop aesthetic, and old school nostalgia when listening to BK collective The Mostacho Xprmnt. The group was founded by Costa Rican drummer and composer Andres Marin and consolidated in 2013 in New York City with Eitan Akman and Haruka Yabuno. The group now also includes lead singer Songyi Jeon, Dave Lowenthal, Luis D'Elías, and Miguel Gallardo. The sound has evolved -- over time -- as well into a melting pot of neo-soul, R&B, Funk, Jazz, Rock, and more. Think Erykah Badu meets Esperanza Spalding.\n\nTheir latest song and in-studio video, \"Que Mae Mas Raro,\" is out now. According to the group, the self-proclaimed 'ode to weirdness' reflects the limitations of judgement and tolerance.

It's simultaneously entertaining and oddly endearing.\n\nWith an African backdrop [reminiscent of his past video] Siimba is seen interacting with a number wild cats, from gorgeous lions to a cuddly looking cheetah, with whom he dances, plays in the grass, and even does push-ups. While not wholly varied in its shots, the video is mesmerising and easy to get lost in. The song itself, \"W.I.A,\" is a subtle and well-versed attack on the BS that seems to run rampant in the music industry.\n\nFrom the Afu-Ra-esque look, and the incredible production that -- quite frankly -- innovates by sticking to the basics, Siimba quickly sets himself apart from other rappers on your playlist right now. To top it off, he has bars; like, for days. \"I used to not smoke but now I'm feeling like I need that, cuz all my people stay up on the joint like a knee cap.\"\n\nIf you're not up on Siimba yet, peep out coverage of his first single, and his first NYC gig. \"If you don't know, now you know [*Biggie voice].\"\n\nhttps://youtu.be/oN36HaYaZdc",

Whether the bi-product of jadedness as a result of numerous mediocre submissions or the impression his SoundCloud avatar exuded, I walked into his latest EP, <em>We Were Friends</em> with the expectations of being slightly let down; that couldn't be farther from reality. What I just spent the last two days digesting is a curated, lyrically rich collection of contemporary, fresh, soulful [New York] hip-hop.\n\nProduced entirely by Seneca B -- a name I'm not wholly familiar with -- Des drops seven tracks that have a cohesive, jazzy vibe that runs the gambit from introspective themes, the loss of love, and fake friends. He has a cadence and scheme that loosely resembles Homeboy Sandman; \"my words are better when they're undisclosed, the truth is better when it's undisclosed,\" Des laments on the the song \"Clipped,\" which was one of my personal highlights here. \"Never Know\" is another standout, with it's AZ sampled chorus and Des' gritty flow, \"this is my nirvana, still no support from my mama.\"\n\nWhile he's been rapping for close to 5 years now, he's only recently started releasing music in the past 365 days; after graduating from SUNY Plattsburgh in May 2015, he realized it was the perfect time to take a stab at a career in the industry. \"I believe I have the ability to make a valuable and positive impact on the industry,\" notes Des. He seems suited to an imprint like Rhymesayers for example. With this being his second year of releasing music on a [professional] level, Des comes off as confident, well put together, and focused. <em>We Were Friends</em> is recommended listening!\n\n<iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/playlists/258069378&color=ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false\" width=\"100%\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"no\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe>",

    "content_html": "[dropcap]Q[/dropcap]uality. Consistency. Hip-hop. The name Skyzoo may be one you've heard spoken in many circles over the years -- and rightfully so. While only momentarily popping his head into the mainstream, this lyricist's lyricist and notorious ghostwriter has managed to tour the world, drop seven LPs -- five of which have charted -- and work with A-list celebrities and musicians, from John Legend to Spike Lee. One of the things I've always loved about him is his ear for beats. He works with a very specific circle on his solo projects, and has also branched off and worked exclusively with a handful of them on more focused output, like !llmind, 9th Wonder, and -- most recently -- Apollo Brown.\n\nWhat keeps Skyzoo focused? \"For me, it's just making music that I'm proud of; [music] that when I look back on it -- whether I look back on it tomorrow or five or ten years from now -- I'm still proud of it,\" he says without hesitation. It's this pride in his work that resonates with listeners who have been following the BK rhymer since The Salvation dropped. His upcoming LP, <em>The Easy Truth</em> is no different. A collaboration with Apollo Brown, who most recently collaborated with west coast artist Ras Kass, the project is one he's particularly proud of; \"Everything worked out perfectly [with this album].\"\n\nWhile one set of the video for the project's lead single \"Couple A Dollars,\" featuring Joell Ortiz, Skyzoo took some time out to chat with us about his career, how The Easy Truth stacks up to his other albums, and much more.\nCheck out the interview after the jump! BK stand up!\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yJ5dRA_L4M\n\n<strong>What keeps you making music that's so true to hip hop and so underground? What's your inspiration?\n</strong>\nFor me, it's just about being able to make the music that I can be proud of no matter how far along the clock is. I always want to be able to look in the mirror and be proud of what I made. I never want to have those moments where I look back and say, 'Dang. I did that. I've got to take that on the chin.' I never want to do that.\n\n<strong>Has there ever been pressure for you to conform or change your sound at all?\n</strong>\nI think there's pressure for all artists, especially in the beginning when you're trying to get your foot in the door. It becomes, 'Well you know if you just did this, it could go this way, or that way,' and I think that all artists, myself included, go through that. But I'm one to march to the beat of my own drum because I've always been a leader, not a follower. My entire life -- even as a kid -- I've always been the leader of the pack. So I'm going to do what I want to do, and what I feel makes sense to me regardless; whether right or wrong I'll live with the decisions I make and be able to say, 'You know what, I did that because it was me. I can accept that; I can respect that, I can take that because it was me.'\n\nSo there's been pressure at times. There's no pressure now - I think as artists you may put pressure on yourself, because you may turn on the TV or radio, or open up a magazine, and want to be in a certain position, but I've been in all those positions, and still am. I'm cool. I'm 'underground', but I ghostwrite for some of the biggest artists on the radio, so I'm cool. I've got all those mainstream guys that everybody's going to at MSG and Staples or whatever to perform, those guys are on my phone. I'm respected by all those guys -- it's a blessing to be able to say that. I'm respected and revered and loved by all those guys, and I help a lot of those guys out when it comes to music.\n\n<strong>So right now you're shooting a video, and it's the first single off of <em>The Easy Truth</em>. On your Facebook, I know you said you went to Detroit and made some songs, but you didn't give a lot of details, so how did it originally come about?\n</strong>\nWell, the way it all came together, Apollo Brown and myself have been real cool for years. We probably met around '07 or something, and we've been cool for years in the industry. You know when you get in the industry, it's like going to work every day, you make work friends. So we became real cool and real tight, and toured together back in 2014, and we've done records together. He has songs with my friends, he had a song with Barrel Brothers, so we had done work together, but here and there, and the fans seeing that wanted more than that. So to get to the base of the question, it started on Twitter, because after all those little things I mentioned, the fans on Twitter were like, 'You guys gotta do a whole joint, a whole project for real.'\n\nAnd the tweets got so loud, like 'Apollo Brown, you gotta do a whole album with Skyzoo', and vice verse and Apollo Brown texted me one day and said, 'I know you see these tweets. We might have to do this.' So I said, 'You know what, you right. We're both fans of each other's music, let's put the time aside and do it,' and that's how it came about.\n\n<strong>One thing I think is cool about you too is, you're really into collaboration albums. Aside from your projects, like you worked with 9th Wonder - so what's next? Do you have an on running list of producers or artist that you're interested in doing an entire project with?\n</strong>\nThere are definitely producers that I still want to work with, and it sounds weird, because I've been fortunate enough to work with so many great producers. But, there's always somebody who's super dope who I haven't had the chance to work with, or even if I worked with them, I haven't done a whole project, yet. I don't know who would be next, because I'm not super focused on that at the moment, I'm excited about The Easy Truth; however, with me doing those types of projects, it's always to do something in between solo albums coming out, and I'm big on having a project come out every year. We live in a space where you've got to stay active and be in people's minds, whether you're mainstream, underground, or in between like me.\n\nWhatever it may be, you've got to be active, and I'm into putting out a project every year. I don't want to put out a solo album every year, because if I do that, I feel like the whole story I'm telling as far as the duration of my catalog, may seem rushed or watered, so I find ways to do things in between. So if I put out Salvation in 2009, then in 2010 I'll put out Live from the Tape Deck with !llmind. If I put out a mixtape after that, then I'll put out A Dream Deferred. If I put out an EP after that, then I'll put out Music for My Friends. That's just that it is for me, and this is another piece in the catalog, but the good thing about when I take that approach, it doesn't alter or change the quality.\n\nSome people say, 'Oh, Imma just throw this project together really quick and keep it moving.' I don't believe in that at all, because I know everything that's put out, it's going to last forever.\n\n<strong>Recently you did a project for<em> Reasonable Doubt</em>, and you did \"Friend Or Foe Part 3.\" Do you want to talk a little bit about that, how it came about, and being from Brooklyn, maybe how important Jay-Z is to you as an artist?\n</strong>\nWell just starting with that, Jay-Z is top two for me of all time, easily top five as far as MCs. My favourite MCs ever are Jay-Z and Mos Def, neck and neck regarding how strongly I feel about them. For me to sit here and not say that Jay-Z inspired me would be a bold faced lie. Jay-Z has inspired me tremendously as an MC, as a writer, the way I approach songs and music, not trying to be like him, but learning from what he's put out there. Just like playing ball, Kobe learned from Mike, it's just like playing ball, LeBron learned from Mike, it's the same thing.\n\nI grew up a Jay fan and still am, even being in the industry, so with all of that, the influence, and him carrying the baton for Brooklyn, and being all that, definitely means a ton to me. As far as the song, Genius came up with the idea 100%. I never thought about it; I never had any intentions of redoing \"Friend or Foe.\" They were like, 'We got this idea, and we don't know too many people who could pull this off, but you can. What would you think about Friend or Foe Part 3., you're the son of the guy who got killed in \"Friend or Foe Part 2.\"\n\nI loved it, but my big thing was, I didn't want people to think it was coming off as a Jay-Z diss. So, as a writer, I had to blatantly make sure I was not Skyzoo in the record. I had to point out all these vast differences, the kid is 20 years old, I'm far from 20, I'm 33, the kid is from Compton, I'm from St. James, so it was all these different things that I had to make sure I pointed out in the song, so people could say, 'He's not rapping as Skyzoo.' It was a ton of fun, it was a blast, and I was curious to see what the response was going to be, if people were going to catch it, or be like 'Yo, Skyzoo is dissing Jay-Z', but 100% across the board, everybody caught it. They were like, 'This is amazing, this is creative, this is super dope, nobody's doing this type of stuff no more.'\n\n<iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/271432444&color=ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false\" width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" frameborder=\"no\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe>\n\n<strong>What are your thoughts on some of the new cats that care coming up and the new sound in hip hop?\n</strong>\nI think we're in a climate where if you don't like what's going on over here, you can just go across the street and get what's over there. It's a lot of that. With the internet you can go online - you can listen to the radio, or turn off the radio and go online and find more than what's on the radio. So I think overall, the climate is dope because they're so many options, not because, necessarily what's mainstream or being pumped out there has changed for the better. Some of it has, but it's really about the fact that there's so much music to pick from, you can find something that's dope. There's tons of it.\n\n<strong>When it comes to not writing your rhymes, what's your thoughts on that? Like the whole Drizzy not writing his raps? There're two schools of thought, because for one, it's lucrative for people to not write their shit for you...</strong>\n\nFor me, yeah.\n\n<strong>What do you think about it, though?\n</strong>\nWell for me, like I said I'm a ghostwriter, I write raps for other people all the time. So, on one hand, I love it, that's more business for me, but on the other hand I think what people misconstrued with the whole situation is, some of the earliest hip-hop records, the first hip-hop record, Rapper's Delight, was written by somebody else. So it's a tricky thing, because there's nothing wrong with having a ghostwriter. I think the confusion comes in with the fans where they're made to believe that say 'artist X' is believed to be an amazing MC and lyricist, genre changer, somebody to carry the flag and change the culture, and is going to be one of the greatest ever; when you find out that guy doesn't write, that's when it's a problem.\n\nThe fact that guys like Diddy, Timberland, different people like that don't write, people don't have a problem with that, because they don't look to those guys to be all-time great lyricists, they look to them for great records. They look to those guys for all the things they've done throughout their careers as far as their catalog, music that stood the test of time. You don't look at Timberland or some of these people and say, 'He's one of the greatest lyricists ever.' So the fact that they don't write, it's okay, nobody cares, it's enjoying the music.\nBut when you have artists who promote themselves as one of the best, the greatest ever, top ten/top five at the moment, those guys are supposed to be able to write, so when you find out they don't write, that's when the alarms go off, that's the part that the people on the outside looking in didn't really understand. When you find out Santa Claus isn't real, it's like 'wow', and I think that's what it comes down to.\n\n<strong>Here's a question that might be hard for you. If I said, 'Skyzoo, could you stack your projects into your top three projects' what would you say?\n</strong>\nThat's incredibly tough. Music for my Friends is one of the three, <em>The Easy Truth</em> is up there, I'm excited about it, <em>Salvation</em> for sure, and <em>Theo vs. JJ</em> was such a favorite moment of mine, Ode to Reasonable doubt, and I've already hit five, I've broken through the ceiling. As far as my solo efforts, <em>Music for my Friends</em> resonated with me so much, because it was exactly how I saw it. I don't put a project out unless it's what I want it to be, but with this one, I just envisioned being 13/14 years old, and how I would tell these stories from that place, while not being that age. I feel like for me personally, what I saw for myself, I hit it right on the mark. <em>Salvation </em>is the first one, and it tipped my whole life. <em>Theo vs. JJ</em> - it's tough to answer that question well.\n\n<strong>Is <em>The Easy Truth</em> one of your best projects? You happy about it? Excited?\n</strong>\nYeah. Everything worked out perfectly with it, and the good thing about being able to collab is a meeting of the minds. If it's someone you don't know, people can tell, but if it's someone who you love and respect their music --and you already have a relationship -- it's easier for those minds to meet, and the vision to come across right.\n\n<iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/playlists/2413355&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true\" width=\"100%\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"no\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe>",

    "content_html": "[dropcap]2</strong>[/dropcap]016 has been the year of the super groups; straight out of NYC comes No Panty. More than just a catch phrase that Hot 97's Ebro has been saying daily on air, the legit group, which consists of notable Hispanic rappers Joell Ortiz, Bodega Bamz, and Nitty Scott MC, recently released a full-length gem full of Latin flair, bars, and good old fashioned NYC hip-hop. <i>WestSide Highway Story</i> hit the net about 30 days ago -- and may have been lost in the sea of higher profile drops, such as the chart-topping <i>Birds In The Trap Sing Brian McKnight</i> by Travis Scott, and <i>Campaign</i> by Ty Dolla Sign. For those that indulged, though, it's a dope ride.\n\nThe project is produced entirely by Salam Remi, who is both iconic and underrated at the same time -- his catalogue includes records with Nas, Alicia Keys, and more. He creates an interesting blend of traditional Latin instrumentation and classic golden era breakbeats; it's not a question of whether the joints are good, as all three of the artists have a reputation for quality. Besides the obvious sonic difference, it's crazy how much the trio reminds me of The Firm, the ill-fated group that [most memorably] included Nas, Az, and Foxy Brown -- and production from Dr Dre.\n\nThe songs run the gambit and vary regarding their actual subject. A few of the joints are just to the point punchline driven heat rocks, like the \"Welcome To The Mardi Gras\" sampled \"Hola.\" Then there's my favourite track, \"Iceys On Deck.\" The album has some more 'real' moments, too. \"Mother's Mark,\" which has Papi describing his birth, and Nitty Scott getting so deep you can [figuratively] hear her tears soaking the page as she writes, is a great exmple. Lastly, there's the no-brainer \"No Panty Anthem,\" which is sure to be a party staple for the next few summers at least.\n\nMore than worth a spin -- even if you have to overlook the over abundance of the 80s echo chamber effects. Levántate for the realness!\n\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"450\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/playlists/250438441&color=ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false\"></iframe>",

A point of view that always learns what is fact and what is fiction as we watch these tables turn.\"</blockquote>\n[dropcap]N[/dropcap]ot all hip-hop is straightforward; that's not to say that Asheville, NC, based spiritual and mystic artist Bryan Divisions' music is by any means not easy to digest, but it's an alternate listen. Many artists like to hang their hat on the belief that they have cinematic or extra visual rhyme patterns -- but Bryan more humbly does that without rubbing your face in it. His music is at once inspirational, transitional, and challenging. He has a strong focus on his lyrics, which at points come across as uber poetic, and more like a self-help manual/guide. His full-length, <a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/bryandivisions/sets/shivai-2015\"><em>Shivai</em></a>, is an exploration of many things -- developing an understanding of God on the record of the same name, finding your yourself, and channel your true potential. \"Channel,\" \"Stars,\" and the title track all have a dose of positivity that almost seems jarring over the production that could easily be ridden in darker directions by another artist.\n\nOn his website, he describes himself as relinquishing all the previously ingrained belief systems he learned through life's journey which only served to limit him, such as fear and doubt. \"Discover and become yourself,\" he laments on \"Shivai,\" \"you're not here to become someone else.\" This theme of elevation and finding your truer purpose while opening up your third eye is carried across the bulk of his work, making him come across as more of a spirit animal than a contemporary rap artist [although he looks the part]. In essence, hip-hop is just one of the many platforms for him to spread his message of peace and [self] love.\n\nListening to his music, and then watching his live show is two different experiences altogether. The energy he exudes -- as seen in the footage of his 50-minute set during the three-city Higher Vibes Tour -- is explosive, to say the least. Music, though, is only one angle of his mission to help you elevate yourself -- he's also an author, and his 111-page book \"<a href=\"http://www.bryandivisions.com/become-yourself/\">Become Yourself: A Guidebook To Discovering Your Higher Self</a>\" is available on his website.\n\nBryan is interesting as hell -- bottom line. Take a few minutes to check out his music. Start with his \"Stranger Things\" track below, and work your way through his catalogue of refreshingly positive and insightful music.\n\nCheck the bars!\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCi_Y1qTssE\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kgNJRz6dHg",

The Kendrick Lamar collaborator has always come across as quasi-mysterious to us, though. We knew he had some high-power connections somewhere, which afforded him the opportunity to be featured one of hip-hop's [current] best artists, but until we watched the first instalment of his new Docuseries, \"America's Favorite,\" we didn't know the half.\n\nThe humble rapper, amidst extremely engaging visuals, tells his story -- from appearing on chart-topping albums by Flo-Rida and B.O.B, working with the likes of Will I Am, Timbaland, and Polow Da Don, all while still being out on the streets [literally] ducking bullets and reciprocating. It's all leading up to his opus, <i>Searching For Salvation</i>, an album that he describes as taking his whole life up to this point to create. It's impossible not to get wrapped up in the hype after watching this video -- check it out for yourself. Be sure to keep an eye on Spitfiya!

Although consistently voted one of the world's top cities to live in, the city also battles rising drug abuse. In fact, the BC Emergency Health Services has been faced with well over 3000 OD cases this year alone; with a sizable percentage of them dying -- and 60% of those testing positive for Fentanyl. This unprecedented rise was the catalyst for the record \"Mention That (In The Couv),\" which features Flintroy, Atlin and IvnTwnSnd -- over the piano-driven beat by Myles himself.\n\nThe track is has a ride out vibe to it -- ripe for a visual treatment.

    "content_html": "[dropcap]I[/dropcap]n today's sea of endless mainstream mumbly commercially viable nonsense we often unable to deeply connect with an artist's music. Now, that's either because it's just a series of incoherent dribble, or because it fails to scratch the surface. This inability to put themselves into the music and truly connect with listeners is the difference between rapping because it's a 'cool thing to do,' and rapping as an artistic outlet or means of escape. JFields is the latter.\n\nAt a young age, JFields went through the foster system and truly had to endure some terrible stuff. Once experience he openly shares is that he was put in a pot of scalding hot water by a foster parent in a cruel act at the age 3 -- which is horrendous. He spent the better part of his childhood jumping around, leaving him feeling quite detached from basic elements on Maslow's hierarchy of needs. He manages to find some of the love and belonging he lacked in gang OGs, and became involved in a street life of sex, drugs, and violence.\n\nNow, music had always been a part of his life -- indeed, he was brought up singing ]in church choir and was really into the southern hip-hop vibes that gripped the game in the nineties era. He started making beats as a hobby; it soon blossomed into a passion that nosedived into a career. His difficult past has become a source of inspiration for his music, and a series of hard life lessons that are serving to help him be both a positive, hardworking person and father to his baby girl.\n\nHis story is inspiring, and his music is dope -- JFields is an artist worth checking out. This isn't suburban wanna-be fantasy rap; this is an artist whose been through it all, putting it all on the line. A true underdog story. The stuff that the hip-hop culture used to readily embrace with open arms. Check it out.

    "content_html": "[dropcap]T[/dropcap]he music industry is a rough, tricky business, emphasis on the word business. There are a ton of moving parts. Although there are prominent examples of indie artists making their way to the top without major label intervention at some point, it is rare; Mac Miller and Logic are a few names that come to mind, although those even observations could be dicey -- as Rapbooth described some time ago. That's what makes a case like James \"Trakz\" Wade so unusual. A relatively unknown R&B singer from Franklin County, Virginia, he's on the come up in a major way. Look, accolades and numbers speak volumes; Trakz isn't just blowing smoke, he charting!\n\nHis breezy debut single, \"You Are The One\" is laced with a sonic aura that takes us back to the sound that dominated the airwaves in the late 90s and early 2000s. You know, that sound reminiscent of Craig David's smash \"Fill Me In\" and young Mario's reboot of \"Just A Friend.\" It sounds like a hit -- and that sentiment is certainly supported by it's early entrance onto the Billboard charts, making him one of the first fully indie artists to do so with an unknown first single; alongside names like Janet Jackson none the less. Also, he plays his own instruments. \n\nWith such a huge co-sign -- and achievement -- so early on in his career, it's a safe bet that he's headed in the right direction. Currently on the grind promoting his new single \"Lotus,\" he recently sat down for a chat with AAHH about his music, his goals, and what we can look out for next.\n\nDon't sleep on Trakz -- with about 30 bangers in the canon, he's about to blow!\n\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"450\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/253777067&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true\"></iframe>\n\n<b>So Trakz, tell me about your music -- describe your sound. </b>\n\nMusic is so non-linear today, and because of that I always try to incorporate sounds from other genres into my music -- even though I'm an R&B singer. My music would be considered Contemporary R&B with an old school vibe to it.\n\n<b>How did you get involved in music? </b>\nI got into music mainly because of my grandfather who used to be a gospel singer/guitar player in his younger days. He allowed me to borrow his guitar as a kid and practice on my own. \n\n<b>Who/what were some of your influences?</b>\n\nI'm always inspired by artists/bands that play their instruments. Prince, Marvin Gaye, and The Beatles are my big three. Ritchie Valens [\"La Bamba\"] is another big inspiration for me. The movie \"La Bamba\" along with \"Purple Rain\" and \"The Five Heartbeats\" really motivated me to want to pursue a career in the industry.\n\n<b>What have you released so far? </b>\n\nCurrently, I have my two singles \"You Are The One\" and \"Lotus\" available on iTunes, Google Play, Spotify, and iHeart Radio to name a few. \n\n<b>What are you currently working on? </b>\n\nI've got close to 30 songs I haven't released, which were going to be used for my album. At this point, my primary focus is promoting \"Lotus,\" including a music video and a remix featuring a more established artist in the industry. \n\n<b>What have been some of your biggest achievements thus far? </b>\n\nI entered the Billboard charts in May for my first single \"You Are The One\" alongside Tyrese and Janet Jackson. I am the first independent Artist ever to impact Urban AC/Urban and Rhythmic Radio with an unknown song and fresh career. Finally, according to DRT (Digital Radio Tracker), I'm at #90 in the Top 200 Independently charts nationally. \n\n<b>What are your goals at the end of the day? </b>\n\nMy goals in the industry are to -- first and foremost -- make music that can be enjoyed decades from now. Secondly, I want my talent as a one-man studio to be recognized and respected. I lace the beat, play the instruments, sing the vocals/background vocals, then I engineer and master the song myself.",

    "content_html": "[dropcap]T[/dropcap]here is truly something special about Adrian Younge's music. The methodical, upper echelon, level of quality and attention to detail in his unique blend of the late 60s to early 70s sound is a standard that not many musicians these days can live up to. I first became deeply immersed in his work after stumbling across Something About April back in 2012 and have been an avid listener from that point forward. For any crate digging sample freak, his music is a no-brainer -- a stark departure from the direction that contemporary urban mainstream music has taken. With all it's vintage aesthetic, though, it comes off as fresh and new. Music that's meant to be experienced.\n\nHe rose to notoriety in many hip-hop circles after he collaborated with Ghostface Killah for the first of two installments of <em>Twelve Reasons To Die</em>, put in work on Jigga's MCHG [on the song \"Picasso Baby], and was the sample bank used by Primo for the Royce 5'9 collaborative project <em>PRhyme</em>. Not to mention his work on Kendrick Lamar's \"untitled 06.\" The crossover into hip-hop -- and his work alongside Ali Shaheed Muhammad of ATCQ on his label Linear Labs -- has grown his very focused and adoring fan base.\n\nAdrian has more than established himself, and as such, has decided to take a leap with his latest project, <em>The Electronique Void: Black Noise</em>. \"I wanted to make an electronic album that [actually] is an electronic album. There was a time when you heard the concept of electronic music, and you didn't think of the notion of EDM. It's not EDM; this is straight electronic music, but it's electronic music recorded in the way our pioneers did it, using the same kind of equipment and techniques, so it sounds different.\"\n\nAdrian took some time out to chat with us about <em>The Electronique Void: Black Noise</em>, his creative process, his label, his record store, and much more. Check out the interview below, and be sure to grab the album for yourself. Also -- he and Ali Shaheed Muhammad scored Marvel's \"Luke Cage,\" so now you know!\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-S66KHJjyO4\n\n<strong>Let’s talk about the new album -- it’s quite different than your other work, what made you explore this new avenue?\n</strong>\nWell, I've always wanted to do an electronic album. The thing is, I had to wait for the right time because I had to establish who I am first. I'm a composer/producer that loves cinematic music from the late 60s early 70s, more particularly from the period of '68 to '73. So this has been brewing in me for a while, and I just finally said you know what, it's time to go in. So I'm hanging out with NoID a lot -- that's one of my good friends -- and he was just rekindling my affinity with analog synthesizers, and I just said you know what? It's time now. I've got to do this project. So I hooked up with one of my good friends who's also in my band, and he's like a mentor to me, Jack Waterson, to put this together. I said, 'Handle the dialogue, this is the concept, and I'll handle the music.' So he controlled the discourse -- the dialogue. It's a dark, twisted story where we're explaining that love is a concept, it's not something that's finite. You can't determine all its variables, but you know it's there. So, it's a story about 'how to love.'\n\n<strong>How do you come up with the concepts for your albums?\n</strong>\nA lot of times it's more of a precognitive, intuitive thinking type of mindset, where I know I want to do another project and then something just jumps in my head that just inspires me so much that it inspires music. I make music with parameters and limitations, meaning I like to create boundaries I have to stay within and make something within those boundaries. So for example on this album, I didn't play any bass guitar, no piano -- everything was analog synth. No horns, no flutes, and the only thing as far as an organic instrument is a drum set, and I'm singing into a vocoder while I play. So those are the only two love elements, so I wanted to prove to myself that I could make an album not relying on my key instruments.\n\n<strong>Your music is very meticulous, and it has an intense thought process behind it. It also has a particular type of sound. So what drives that? Do you have a lot of influences?\n</strong>\nWell for me, all my influences come from old records. I tell people I don't listen to new music. New music to me is old records I haven't heard. So that's where all my influences come from, and the thing is that today, people don't pay attention to detail as much as they used to, and my fan base is a very intelligent fan base. It's arguably academic. My fan base needs a little more, so I like to cater to those kinds of people because that's the kind of person that I am. So there're people out there that think the music of the past was great, but that's gone because people don't make music like that anymore, but it's just not true. You can decide not to cut any corners, and just basically take a stance that you're not going to defer to recording in a way that takes away from yourself. A lot of people want to use pro tools and all that, which is great, but for what I do you have to use tape, you have to use real instruments.\nThere's a lot of musicians out there that want to do what I do, but they don't want to put in the work and spend the money to get a great, classic analog sound to make more music. So all of this pushes me, because when I hear people that appreciate what I do, like yourself, it's my inspiration. I always tell people I make music for the audience in my head, and when other people like my music, it's very pleasing, inspiring, and motivating, because I feel as though what I'm doing is something that is meant for a select few. Since the vast majority of people like top 40, and I hate top forty. So my inspiration comes from the recognition I get from like-minded individuals, and also my mission to always try to outdo myself.\n\n<strong>Personally, I like to collect vinyl, and I'm into vintage music. I got into it because I like the elements and samples of [hip-hop] records -- do you maybe see yourself as being a bridge to vintage music or old jazz?\n</strong>\nAbsolutely. Just as hip-hop serves as a conduit to the past and culture, I want to act as a conduit to the past for our culture, as well as younger people searching. So hip-hop introduced us to The Breaks, and I want to introduce people to The Breaks and hip-hop, so I look to serve as a conduit to the past.\n\n<strong>I'd love to know your role in the PRhyme album. Because it's produced by Premier, but you brought all the samples and little elements. Could you maybe explain how that works?\n</strong>\nPremo sampled my entire catalog to make PRhyme, and this was Royce da 5'9\"s idea because at that time Premo knew of me, but he didn't want to limit himself to sampling one person. A lot of people don't realize how difficult it is to make a full album sampling one person. He started on one track, and he went to the next, and he went to the next, and he got into a real rhythm, and just really made classics, and to me, it was an honor because having Premo sample my music makes my music better. It makes me listen to my music in a different way, so it's special for me. And I love Premo, and I love Royce. Those are my really good friends.\n\n<strong>Can you tell me a little bit about Linear Labs, and the ideology behind it, and some of the artists that are a part of it?\n</strong>\nLinear Labs is a label that I run, and it serves as a record label that addresses the desires of the tailored mind. People that want something more bespoke. It's more of a handmade artisan approach to the crafting of music, so everything on Linear Labs is all on tape, all live instruments, and recorded in the way that they would have done yesterday, but with a modern sentiment. I'm never the kind of guy that wants to merely rehash old music, I always want to something that when you hear it, there's something fresh about it, and that's the mantra of Linear Labs. So, on Linear Labs we have an artist, Loren Oden, that's going to be releasing a solo album pretty soon. We have Ali Shaheed Muhammad from A Tribe Called Quest, him and I are releasing an album called The Midnight Hour next year.\n\n<strong>And it's just a bunch of different artists, but it's more so a boutique outlet for stuff that I like.\nYou own a record store as well, right?</strong>\n\nYeah, the record store is called The Artform Studio, and it's a record store and hair salon that is owned and operated by myself and my wife. Right now we've moved locations, so we're down for about two months, then we'll be back open in Los Angeles.\n\n<strong>That's incredible. I can only imagine that you have amazing records there. With your music and your taste in music…\n</strong>\nOh yeah, dude. It's great.\n\n<strong>And as well, something I found interesting on your Wikipedia page is that you're an entertainment law professor.\n</strong>\nYeah, I did that for three years, and then when music took over my life I didn't have time. So I don't do that anymore, but that's definitely on my resume.\n\n<strong>The model that's on your <em>Something About April II</em> cover, Logan Melissa, has the coolest Instagram ever. What's your relationship with her?</strong>\n\nShe's been a good friend for a while. Wax Poetics approached me and said, 'You need to check this girl out. She'd probably be a good candidate for your record cover.' Because she was going to start writing for them - she's breathtaking, but she's very smart, too. We met, and we just hit it off. She's like an extension of myself as far as visually, because she gets everything I want to do.\n\n<strong>Anything you’d like to leave us with?\n</strong>\nI wanted to make an electronic album that [ is] is an electronic album. There was a time when you heard the concept of electronic music, and you didn't think of the notion of EDM. It's not EDM; this is straight electronic music, but it's electronic music recorded in the way our pioneers did it, using the same kind of equipment and techniques, so it sounds different. I want it to be a piece that hopefully becomes a classic.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iqE6RmwYRwY\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qtRdmGDllw",

A Jackson-native, YP has been methodically making a name for himself not only as an artist and performer but as a songwriter in general. He and his brother -- collaboratively -- began performing at various WJLB [regional FM] functions, and in conjunction with Floyd Mayweather promotions. His biggest look, as a writer, came when he collaborated with A-Game Writers [music production company] to write the Nephrateri Lewis featured single \"On Fleek,\" which appeared in the fourth episode of the second season of Fox's hip-hop drama, Empire.\n\nHis newest record, the sexy \"Lie 2 Me, is an attempt by the Jackson upstart at furthering the buzz he's already set off with singles like \"Are You Ready\" and Day 1.\" Amidst a lush backdrop, which an artist like Bryson Tiller would be quite at home upon, the artist drops an anthem for the light-night love sessions with a side piece -- the high-quality video treatment by Cloudy Productions further the overall grandeur of the release. Check it out for yourself below, and stay up for more releases from YP.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JPhpNoQh0Ts",

    "content_html": "[dropcap]M[/dropcap]iami, Florida, rapper Xleoniduz [the x is silent] was molded on the mid 90's hip-hop which was dominated -- predominantly -- by Def Jam Records. \"The 'X' comes from Malcolm x and DMX, and the 'Z' at the end is from Jay-Z -- my other favorite rapper,\" he confidently explains. As a youth, his father was both a DJ and an underground rapper; it's been noted he was an underground pioneer at rapping bilingual. His love of rap was ultimately instilled through his father, who would blast Rakim, Biggie, 2pac, Ice Cube, Craig Mack, and Redman.\n\nHis parents split at a young age, and he affectionately recalls when he went to visit his mother one summer (either 1996 or 1997); \"My mom had this album called Supa Dupa Fly by Missy Elliott, and I was like WTF is this? I fell in love with the beats and the sounds especially \"Beep Me 911.\" Her roommate one day notices that all I did was listen to music, so she one day introduced me DMX, Jay-Z, and Busta Rhymes. From that moment on I wanted to do was music.\" That sentiment has rung true, as he's been grinding like a madman on the local scene recently -- and starting to build a buzz with his first three singles. One of which, \"Dominican Bitch,\" is produced by Icy Twat of the illustrious Divine Council (who recently signed with LA Reid).\n\nCheck out his Q&A with us below, and get familiar with him and his music.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/O7PEQGdz4Jw\n\n<b>Where are you from originally?</b>\n\nI'm from Miami; specifically, Dade County -- raised in Allapattah and Wynwood/Overtown.\n\n<b>How would you describe your sound?</b>\n\nMy sound is a mixture of different things; I'm influenced by Jay-Z, Pusha T, Pharrell,  DMX, Kid Cudi, and André 3000.\n\n<b>How did you get involved in music?</b>\n\nI got involved in music through my father; he was a DJ in a local club in Allapattah, Miami, which is mainly Dominicans. He would rap. My father introduced me to music at like four years old, and I've been in love with it ever since. I  also I remember watching the video for \"Nigga What, Nigga Who?\"  by Jay-Z and \"Supa Dupa Fly\" by Missy as a kid and knowing that I wanted to rap.\n\n<b>What have you dropped so far?</b>\n\nI have released three songs on SoundCloud -- so far -- and a video on YouTube. I'm working on new songs as we speak; I have a project coming out called Sin Paradise, which is a nickname I gave to Miami. It's how I see Miami through my eyes and lots of story telling about my life and things that go on in in the city. My song \"Windows\" will be on iTunes, Spotify, and Tidal very soon.\n\n<b>What are your goals in the industry?</b>\n\nMy goals are simple; I'm inspired by Rocafella Records, so I want to own myself as much as possible, but ink a deal with a major label as a distributor, and work my way to the top. I have friends who are on the same wavelength as me. We all do something different, and we just wanna bring something new -- and not repetitive -- to music\n\n<b>So, what's next?</b>\n\nThe next thing I see for myself is working dropping more songs; building and getting better at my craft and getting out from the bottom. I come from nothing, so I'm doing whatever I can to make it out.\n\nhttps://soundcloud.com/leoniduz/dominican-bitch-prod-by-icytwat\n\nhttps://soundcloud.com/leoniduz/xleoniduz-pace-park-freestyle\n\nhttps://soundcloud.com/leoniduz/windowthe-rain-2016",

    "content_html": "[dropcap]B[/dropcap]rooklyn has always been a hotbed of raw, genre-defining hip-hop talent. From Biggie Smalls and Special Ed to Busta Rhymes and Sean Price. Phresher is simply another chapter in a long line of royalty. Growing up in Bamaz projects in East New York (statistically the part of Brooklyn with the highest crime rate), he was an only child raised by both his parents. \"My ultimate inspiration—and the reason I am the man I am today—is because of my parents,\" he proudly states, they're my heroes.\" It was one day when his father sent him a beat that he began to explore his skills on the mic; \"I was like hey this [music] sounds good. From there I didn't stop.\"\n\nFlash forward to today, and Phresher is on the cusp of stardom. Currently, he's enjoying the attention that comes along with a buzzing hit-single; \"Wait A Minute,\" which features multi-platinum selling rapper and entrepreneur, 50 Cent, appeared as a bonus cut on the DJ Whoo Kid mixtape, Lost Flash Drive that was released on G-Unit records. The song is in rotation across the country, and —as a byproduct—he's been hitting plenty stages, including some dates opening for the G-Unit. Pre \"Wait A Minute\" success he built an admirable amount of interest collaborating Desiigner for singles, before the 2016 XXL Freshman hit overnight success with the runaway hit, \"Panda.\" The two tracks have since ballooned in their intake.\n\nWith his trajectory headed continuously upward, Phresher remains down to earth and focused on his goals. With a long-term desire to act, a passion for fashion with his clothing line SOBarKlay, and a philanthropic spirit, he's as well-rounded as they come. Whether it's working on his upcoming EP, <i>PH</i>, or coaching youth football, you're not apt to find the buzz-worthy artist sitting still, or engaging in activity that doesn't help to either better his community or bolster his brand. He's an artist you don't want to sleep on for 2017.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-rmHSpH7NCo\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDVJOFMrMkE\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GX7IuwBkxx4",

    "content_html": "<blockquote>“When I was 16, there was no such thing as a 44-year-old rapper. Now that I'm 44, this is new ground that some of my contemporaries and I are breaking. “ --Slug</blockquote>\n[dropcap]I[/dropcap]t's hard to talk about the combination of staying consistent and longevity in the game without mentioning Atmosphere -- the duo of Ant and Slug. Since the onset of their 1997 debut they've lived life on wax, rarely deviating from the transparent realness that their fan base has come to both love and respect. From love, loss, and drugs, to marriage and children, it's been a journey that's weathered multiple eras of hip-hop. \"I try to use the word 'fortunate,' because I don't believe in luck,\" says Slug when discussing how they've managed to stay active and relevant after all these years. \"[some artists over 40] have created empires for themselves; artists like me, who are doing this more at an independent haven't created anything like that I could fall back on,\" Slug humbly explains.\n\nOne could point to his indie label Rhymesayers as an exit strategy, though. Since 1995 (when it was founded), the label has amassed a who's who catalog of underground hip-hop, from Aesop Rock and Brother Ali to Abstract Rude and MF Doom. \"I stand behind all the projects,\" Slug explains, \"these guys are all my friends that I have genuine love for — people I trust to take care of my kids.\"\n\nNow, at 44 years of age and two-decades-deep, Atmosphere have released their eleventh studio album, <em>Fishing Blues</em>. We were lucky enough to sit down with Slug who told us about the album, where the name came from, and more. Check the interview below, and -- if you haven't already -- grab the album today!\n\nhttps://youtu.be/Y6ueCFLkJdA\n\n<strong>So, after 20+ years as an artist in the game, what keeps you going? What makes you keep doing it?\n</strong>\nOn one hand, I don’t really know how to do anything else. And when I say that -- I mean I obviously know how to do other things -- but the challenge of this and the puzzle solving involved in doing this, it calls to me, you know what I'm saying? At this point, like you said after 20 years, that itself has become a new puzzle. When I was 16, there was no such thing as a 44-year-old rapper. Now that I'm 44, this is new ground that me and some of my contemporaries are breaking. Obviously, on the mainstream side of things you have artists who are in their 40s who are doing this, but they kind of created empires for themselves so they could do this at a pace that fits whatever else they are doing in life or business. Whereas you got artists like me, who are doing this more at an independent level who haven't created anything like that I could fall back on. So at the end of the day, to be able to do this still at 44 and push forward; that is the challenge, that is the puzzle, that is the part that motivates me and it is the part that I enjoy.\n\nI guess that's one angle; the other angle is that I enjoy communicating my thoughts, my ideas, and my opinions, you know what I'm saying? When I was younger, I just wanted to be an adult \"MC.\" Now, after 20 years, it's way more than that. I appreciate that people will take a minute to check [my thoughts] on what it is that I'm dealing with. And with that, I feel, comes the responsibility of kind of covering it with my moral code and the life that I live by. At the end of the day, it's all the same shit that had be inspired at the age of 20 but just an evolved version of those things, you know what I'm saying? The validation that comes with it, then there's money… I like the money that comes with it, you know what I mean? There's so many things that I can do with these resources. I'm able to take these resources to use them not to just reinforce my code but also to position friends of mine or artists that I care about to also reinforce their codes, you know what I mean?\n\n<strong>Looking at the latest album, <em>Fishing Blues</em>, what does the title mean? What was the catalyst behind its creation process?\n</strong>\nYou know, the title was a joke. Originally, we had a different title for the record. We had completed the album and we were going out to take photos for what became the cover of the album and the photos on the inside. While we were out taking photos, we were at this lake in my city called Lake Nokomis there was a stack of canoes sitting next to the lake, and I was like “take a picture of those canoes and use it for B-roll.” On one of the canoes, there were some stickers that said ‘B.B. King Fishing Blues'; Ant and I were like “oh s*** that's tight -- that should be the name of the record.” We said it jokingly, and it took us about two minutes to realize that we weren’t joking. It couldn't say B.B. King’s Fishing Blues because that might be a little too ‘meta’ for some people. You know, so we just cut it down to just the ‘Fishing Blues’ part, and it was after that that we realized there's a hell of a lot of fishing references on this f***** record. It didn't even really strike me; we had this one song called \"Fishing\" -- that was the joint with Grouch -- then we had like six or seven songs that had at least references to fishing in it. I hadn't put it all together until we change the name. What is fishing if you break it down? Fishing is a metaphor for a lot of different s*** and truthfully all those metaphors apply to our life especially the concept of going out to catch food for your family or fishing for compliments. All artists do that for validation. And then just fishing as a leisure activity, I mean at my age making music with Anthony is a leisure activity; it just so happens to also provide the sustenance I need, you know what I mean?\n\nhttps://youtu.be/HJOnwLrh3Nw\n<strong>\nIt's interesting because over 20 years your music has had some changes -- but you've also had some life changes. You’ve grown, you're married, and you have children. </strong>\n\nYeah, sure, just like all people, I mean, as you grow you change. I mean, I challenge anybody to be the same person at 40 that you were at 20 . We all grow and change, hopefully, and if you don't, you're f****** up.\n\n<strong>With me as a parent, when I talk to my daughter about the things that I did in the past or my stories, whatever, I can always change things or control it. I mean, you've been doing it for 20\nyears, right? And you're 40. Your twenties and thirties are immortalized online, how do you introduce that to your kid? Have you done that? </strong>\n\nAll of my children are familiar with my music. Obviously my younger ones are not breaking the music down, like taking apart the lyrics; they hear the chorus or pick out a certain line they like and thankfully, so far, they have been free of cursing. But the oldest one, Jacob, he's 22 right now. He actually grew with me; as my career grew, he grew so he was neck-and-neck with it. And yes, I was never really shielding him from the life that I was living. He was very in tune with me and basically he saw me go through all this stuff that immortalized me. Technically, if I had never even immortalized that s*** on tracks, I was a young parent. I had a young kid that would have seen that stuff up close even if it wasn't on tracks. He was still present for it, similar to me and my father. I was there for my dad's ups and downs, and I watched my dad go through all the drama he went through, and it wasn't so much - my dad didn't make records about it; he just lived it. My kid watched me live it. As far as my younger children, they didn't see me live that, they showed up after I had already lived it and I had time to figure it out. Hopefully, when they look back on it, on Daddy's old records, they'll be able to see how life works both the positives and the negatives. I'm not the kind of dude that's going to try to hide anything from my life, you know, I would like to be around and available to explain it to them so there's a reason for it so there's not just this mad negativity or crazy parties without some consequences for decision making. A lot of kinds of music that we listen to is inconsequential, you know what I'm saying? We listen to this music and we don't think about the consequences for the stories being told. The party was the party and we got \"lit\" and we had a good time then we went home the next day we did it again, you know. That's cool, but a lot of it is missing the part where they explain to you the consequences of pulling a gun or the consequences of doing that cocaine. I want to be the father that deals with and talks about the effects of that s***.\n\n<strong>At the end of the day what do you think makes your brand so strong?\n</strong>\nMan, I don't want to be a dick, but I would just say its timing, dude. I was at the right place at the right time and was fortunate, you know what I mean? And I met hella artists who can rap better than me. I do believe that it's all circumstantial. I got put into this position by the Universe more so than by anything else than what I did. Here's what I did: I stuck to my guns. I'm one of the artists that do what I do instead of necessarily fitting into any movement or any scene. That's not saying that it will necessarily work for everyone - if I knew the answer to the question you are asking I would package it and I would sell it. Because there is no real answer – honestly -- it's just dumb luck. But, I try to stay away from the word luck, though. I try to use the word \"fortunate\" though, because I don't believe in luck.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/oFbx4GiwArQ",

The LA-based über talented singer is very much in the same vein as Solange – who did some serious damage on Billboard with her album last week; her upcoming debut album, <em>COALS</em>, is going to be a big deal. In fact, she's already been mentioned by the likes of Spin and New York Times (amongst <em>many</em> others) as an emerging act to keep tabs on. As well, she made on-stage appearances at Capitol Hill Block Party, CMJ, Sasquatch Music Festival, Decibel Festival, Benaroya Hall, and dates with the likes of Bilal, Thievery Corporation, Deltron 3030, The Antlers, SZA, and Daley.\n\nWe had a team listening session of her first three releases from the LP, and they were quite exciting, to say the least -- you could feel the freshness radiating from her unique cadence. She's a no-brainer, and we're proud to be the first to share this new track with all of you. We were also excited to sit with the upstart to chat about her music, her career, and more. Look out for that interview here on the site shortly. For now, let us introduce you to a name you'll be hearing a lot more from soon, Shaprece.\n\nEarly!\n\n<iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https://api.soundcloud.com/tracks/287522206%3Fsecret_token%3Ds-SME0r&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true\" width=\"100%\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"no\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe>",

    "content_html": "<blockquote>\"A nigga working hard every night and day, grinding every night to get my mother straight.\"\n-- Rob Two</blockquote>\n[dropcap]I[/dropcap]nspired his pastor father – who started his career as a bass player – Robert Johnson (professionally known as rapper Rob Two) started out in the church as a drummer for the choir. He took a hiatus from music, though, to follow the money and creative freedom that came with videography and photography work. The allure/draw was too great, though, and before long he was back at it, writing and producing music. His career seemed to metaphorically mash the gas pedal with the release of his record “Jugg,” which received a quality visual treatment. Since that point, he’s seen his social numbers jump, and was even blessed to hit the stage during SXSW. It has all led up to this, though. His first [official] project, “Dynasty,” is a cohesive well-produced ode to his journey up to this point, as well as a braggadocios salute to the good life.\n\nWith the exception of the money-centric “Fasho,” produced by Young Bugatti, all the records were produced by Rob himself and [or] his in-house producer Supaonthebeatz; the result is a very unified sound and vibe throughout, making the listening experience very consistent. The album has a bassy vibe that sits eye level with the current wave running this game, but what’s refreshing is Rob’s approach. He tends to acknowledge his come up from nothing, but not in an annoying way – songs like “Dreams,” chronicles his path in the life, while “Runnin” outlines his hustle; the latter includes an endearing voice over from his mother commending him for not giving up on his dream. You can hear the pride in her voice. The highlights – for us – was track three, “Everyday,” and the co-produced “Celebration.”\n\nhttps://youtu.be/cmj_gPYMkU8\n\nHe’s kind of in the vein of Tory Lanez, but with an edge that favors contemporary rap more than singing, though he does have a more sing-songy vibe on records like the lady-focused “4 AM.” He seems to have a solid pen game, a good handle on what seems to work in today’s climate, and – judging on his outro – a humble demeanor that makes him strangely more relatable. I’d love to hear what he would on slightly different vibes. Dynasty is a solid effort worth a spot on your weekend playlist.\n\n<hr />\n\n<iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/playlists/263590600&color=ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false\" width=\"100%\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"no\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe>",

That's a bold move for any artist, but also a necessary step if you plan to make it a lifetime career. The grind is nothing new to the rapper, though. Without many people to rely on early on, it had become a custom for INTL to take stages into his hands, booking the bulk of his gigs, and battles -- many of which he won. So he's well-versed in handling his own career; his new focus will only serve to help him spread his brand of golden era goodness across the nation.\n\nIf you're a straight up underground, backpacker, substance-filled-bar loving head, this kid is right up your alley. Across his catalog, which includes a record with famed Detroit producer Apollo Brown [amongst other gems], he has a deceptively 90s sound that sounds like it's straight off a cassette dub from your favorite 90s college radio show.\n\nGive Int3rnational a spin -- and if you're liking his material, follow him on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/intl_classics\">Twitter</a>!\n\n<iframe style=\"border: 0; width: 100%; height: 120px;\" src=\"http://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/track=3792177532/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/tracklist=false/artwork=small/transparent=true/\" width=\"300\" height=\"150\" seamless=\"\"><a href=\"http://int3rnational.bandcamp.com/track/session-420\">Session 420 by int3rnational</a></iframe>\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGkOA6YI-RU\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VGQSwu9IoLU",

    "content_html": "[dropcap]T[/dropcap]oday rapper Marshall Mathers, aka Eminem, turns 44 years old. With all of his success, his ultra-shock-value raps, over the top beef, and straight up genius-level pen game, it's easy to forget his pre-slim shady gem, Infinite. Before the Dr. Dre cosigns, before Shady records, before the <a href=\"https://youtu.be/nqV5zLqr2so\">Rap Olympics </a>-- Em was a tongue-twisting emcee fully immersed in the early 90s [see golden era] hip-hop. His first project, <i>Infinite</i>, officially labeled as an EP, was (for those that missed it), a stark departure from the uninhibited, at times brutally raw (and humorous) Slim Shady that most fans fell in love with.\n\nProduction wise, the project was put together by D12 member Mr. Porter and the late Proof. The sound was -- for the most part -- cohesive and clean, and very much reflective of the era. Em was, as he described, \"still figuring himself out.\" Lyrically, he was a beast on this project, although the subject matter and actual flow/delivery weren't yet the Em we got to know later on. He was widely criticized for sounding a lot like AZ, which was accurate (to a degree). His songs seemed to have a more optimistic output on life in general. He wasn't yet a father, and clearly still was still in love with Kim, who we all famously know as the woman he and Haley threw in the river on the morbidly entertaining \"<a href=\"https://youtu.be/UiZ10PFD_04\">Just The Two Of Us</a>.\" This album introduced us to a hungry 24-year old come-up rapper who wanted to pop off and give his girl(s) a better life. The only semblance of uber imaginative pseudo-Shady-esque rhyme schemes was on the record \"<a href=\"https://youtu.be/iiEo9NT9t_w\">Backstabber</a>.\" There are gems here, and bars for days -- and maybe weeks.\n\nThe album has received a great deal of praise in hindsight, although it was widely shit on -- for lack of a better term -- by music journalists at the time. The failure led Em to take a more aggressive tone in his music. Sidebar, his 'new style' was infamously challenged by rapper <a href=\"https://youtu.be/ZFvK480HAx0\">Cage, who claimed Em bit his whole steeze</a>. There was an ensuing beef, which Eminem pretty much bodied with a line on his record \"<a href=\"https://youtu.be/ubEublECnMU\">Role Model</a>\": \"I bought Cage's tape, opened it and dubbed over it.\" I digress, though. The EP stands as a significant slice of hip-hop history; it is probably more accurate to take it as an early demo rather than a debut, as it was the precursor to one of hip-hop's most revered names, and consistent top 5 DOA resident. As we wish Em a happy born day, let's take a spin down memory lane and bump his classic intro to the game; it turns 20 this year!\n\nhttps://youtu.be/4s9epKCKbec",

Sonically Mike sounds like a lost member of the TDE squad, with [almost] aggressive blend of self-conscious bars and soulful, yet dark and bassy, production sensibility he's gravitated towards. As he describes on his site, he began his journey two years ago after receiving some advice from a close friend, “If you don’t do it then no one is gonna get it done.\" As he goes on to describes, \"I allowed my creation to be my destination. Through this...I find myself at the beginning of a new and the end of old.\" Along with the [kind of] creepy, dark photography, his latest project, <i>Two Feet</i>, when looked at as a cohesive package, comes off as an art project; complete with visual and audio components worthy of a gallery exhibition.\n\nAcross the nine-song EP, he covers an array of topics, painting lush rhyme schemes around concepts of mortality and self-reflective sensibility -- with a dash good old fashioned emcee ego -- to create a well-rounded audio journey. His cadence, which almost reminds me slightly of Kendrick in spots, is well complimented by the production of tracks like \"Great,\" dope operatic sample base, the seven-minute \"Not Enough/Timeless,\" or \"Fade Away,\" which was one of my favourite tracks on the project. He also blends a rap/singing vibe on the R&B tinged \"The Passing,\" which is also seven minutes in length.\n\nMike Bandanna is a combination of many different things that have -- historically -- helped many artists recognize a certain level of success. <i>Two Feet</i> is a solid project that he can definitely [metaphorically] hang his hat on and use to further springboard his brand. A worthy addition to your playlist this upcoming week!\n\n<iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/playlists/269098694&color=ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false\" width=\"100%\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"no\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe>",

The high quality visual itself is depicts the rapper in the back of a cop car, and being involved in an altercation that's become common ground in today's media; eventually, though, the tables turn, with the officer on his knees with his hands up.\n\nThroughout his career, he's had a co-sign from super star Kanye West and has worked with West Coast legends like E-40, WC (Westside Connection), and more.

    "content_html": "[dropcap]I[/dropcap]n a recent interview, legendary DJ Clark Kent revealed that BK -- and contemporary hip-hop -- icon Jay-Z recorded a scathing diss record towards Tupac. At the climax of the East/West storm, Pac went on a rampage, dropping a barrage of strongly worded shade towards New York artists, including Biggie, Mobb Deep, and Jigga himself. According to Clark, Jay went full ether on Pac; unfortunately, though, Pac was murdered before the record saw the light of day. Clark mentioned that he was reluctant to put his hands on the record at the time. Because he knew, he'd be unable to hold it back. Can you imagine?\n\nWell, this story got us thinking about some of the other great Holy Grail hip-hop that we've never heard. We've rounded up some of it below, for you reading pleasure. Happy treasure hunting!\n\n<strong>Method Man's Original <em>Tical</em> album\n</strong>\nIn the early days of Wu-Tang Clan, Method Man was undeniably a breakout star. With the record \"Method Man\" serving as the sole solo record on the Clan's game-changing debut, the stage was set for his breakout Def Jam debut album. As the story goes, a reported 15 of the original beats by RZA slated for Tical -- amongst other things -- were lost when the 36 Chambers Studio was flooded in late 1993. As a result, most of the albums production was hastily rushed to meet deadlines while juggling a hectic tour schedule. The result was a classic album that upon it's released cracked top 5 on Billboard; but, can you imagine the heat he lost? Wow. We'll never know what the album could have been if his original vision had been realized.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/yim5_KXmtVI\n\n<strong>Cassette Copy of Snoop's [Actual] Debut\n</strong>\nBefore Doggystyle, there was <em>Over The Counter</em>, which was meant to be not only the debut album from Snoop Doggy Dogg but for the entire Death Row brand (rather than the Chronic). With features from usual suspects as well as George Clinton, the album was set to go; unfortunately, due financial restraints the album, which was already pressed, never saw the light of day. It was heavily bootlegged after the fact, but fact checkers were quick to note that cassette copies floating around included a photo that wasn't snapped until two years later, and improperly listed label credits. The truth is, there is likely only a few legitimate copies of this physical tape [no CDs were made] in actual existence -- if it exists at all. Those curious can settle for terribly dubbed snippets on YouTube.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/HIiftSzg5f8\n\n<strong>MC Hammer and 2Pac collabration On <em>Too Tight</em>\n</strong>\nRemember when Hammer signed to Deathrow? Yeah, I know, right? Well, he recorded a gang of material for the ill-fated -- and terribly named -- Too Tight, which like many Row projects during that period, never can to commercial fruition. Here's the thing, though, there were features from Tupac on the record; in fact, some sources say there may have been upwards of three. Luckily one of the tracks has since surfaced on YouTube, but not all of them! Hammer is very kitschy, no doubt about it, but he holds a special place in the hearts of some. As if you wouldn't be interested in hearing these unreleased collaborations. Stop it 5!\n\nhttps://youtu.be/ag2y4y1Ohu8\n\n2Pac and Boot Camp Clik Come Together As <em>One Nation</em>\n\nTupac burned many bridges in the East leading up to his death; although, he had a lot of love for the big apple -- and he planned to show this to the world with his One Nation project -- a collaboration with the Boot Camp Clik. The whole Duck Down staff paid a visit to PAC summer mansion, and recorded stacks of material; however, a month later Pac was murdered, putting the record in limbo, indefinitely. Words can't describe how dope and utterly significant this project would have been. A few of the joints have leaked on the net, but the vault is still full!\n\nhttps://youtu.be/RnK8wa15wzo\n\nhttps://youtu.be/dAVLcz7mr4I\n\nMystery Jay-Z Reasonable Doubt Records\n\nAfter his original demo tapes leaked, we all kind of thought that we'd heard every Jay-Z record ever. Then Adrien Vargas, the album's art director, and designer, dropped a bomb on the web, an original track listing that included three additional tracks that we've never heard. That raised a whole gang of questions. Have we heard these songs, just with different names? Are these songs sitting on some reels in Dame Dash's basement? Unfortunately, there are no answers. Die hard fans can only hope that Jigga decides to pull a Nas and drop lost tapes some day.\n\n<img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"http://nahright.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/jayz-reasonable-doubt-tracklist.jpg\" alt=\"Ja-Z\" width=\"393\" height=\"524\" />\n\n[Sigh]",

    "content_html": "<blockquote>\"I should make a stand on this land of war\"\n--Bonnevilla</blockquote>\n[dropcap]H[/dropcap]ip-hop has always -- at its core -- been an underdog sport; although it's often used as a cash cow for those more focused on material elements and the overall 'lifestyle' spoils that hip-hop can offer its upper echelon of commercially successful artists. There is a whole generation of underground artists, though, that are making a stand and using hip-hop as an avenue of political upheaval and way of voicing political and social disdain; examples of artists in this vein include Immortal Technique. Salt-Lake-City based Latin-American duo Bonnevilla fits this mold quite well, achieving widespread critical acclaim for their unrelenting social commentary, blended with the sonic aesthetics of underground late 90s hip-hop. With six years in the game, numerous awards, and three full-length albums under their belt, their momentum shows no signs of slowing down, nor wavering in its self-aware sense of purpose.\n\nTheir latest release, <em>Ad Finem</em>, is a 21 track album full of Spanish-language bars, banging boom-bap hip-hop, and sequencing that takes listeners on a journey. It's funny that artists like Drake are popular in countries that don't speak a word of English -- they only follow his melody and production. The same can be said of Bonnevilla, who just 'sound' dope, even if you have no idea what they're saying. For those with the phonetic ability to understand their raps, the duo traverses numerous topics, from loss on the record \"Siempre,\" the heartfelt \"Madre\" which is dedicated to their mothers, and the super lyrical \"Piececitos,\" which translates to \"Tiny Feet.\" That record in particular track is inspired by the poem \"Piececitos\" from Chilean Nobel Prize winner Gabriela Mistral and touches on the poor children that inhabit the streets -- abandoned and forgotten. Another searing record is \"Catarsis,\" which attacks the corruption of the Mexican government, which providing a commentary on their perceived corruption within contemporary religion; \"I am strong because God has abandoned me.\"\n\nThe project also has some star power, including award-winning [Mexican] rappers <a href=\"https://twitter.com/akilammar\">Akil Ammar</a> (on the song \"Siempre\") and <a href=\"https://bocafloja.bandcamp.com/\">Bocafloja</a> (on the song \"Hope\" ), as well as production from Argentinian producer <a href=\"https://gas-lab.bandcamp.com/\">Gas-Lab</a>.\n\nHip-hop is worldwide, says KRS-ONE in the sample used in the intro of the record \"El Mal Necesario.\" Indeed, it's hard to argue it isn't especially when you hear the insane cuts and 90s New York (East Coast) production that the duo rides on this project. Although they are in the US, this project -- which is entirely Spanish -- more than opens the borders for listeners. Whether providing criticism about socio-political injustice abroad in Mexico or at home on their audio opinion piece about presidential hopeful Donald Trump on \"Trompitas,\" they keep it all hip-hop. Real recognize real.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgjN2uWZqGU\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UYko12q5r9Y\n\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"450\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/playlists/247835852&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true\"></iframe>",

    "content_html": "<blockquote>\"It be the closest of niggas that change on you quick and know most fo your business.\"\n--Meek Mill</blockquote>\n[dropcap]I[/dropcap] sometimes liken Meek Milly to the elusive Edward Snowden; much like the whistle blower who alerted us to the fact that US agencies were spying on us, he alerted us to the fact that hip-hop's greatest writer had a couple of monkeys on typewriters behind the scenes. Another commonality is that they were both drug through the mud afterward. Meek's lack of a timely response to Drake's Grammy award winning diss record Back To Back had many uttering phrases like 'washed up' and his career's over.' That, though, couldn't be further from the truth. It's unfair to pit his success against a more 'radio-friendly' artist like Drake and reduce his accolades to insignificance, or an outward display of failure. He made stacks (and stacks) on tour with his gorgeous girlfriend Nicki Minaj, he has earned three gold and one platinum plaque for his wall in the last 365 days, has a net worth of $4 million, and is -- figuratively -- shitting on a lot of rappers. His latest effort DC4Life, which blazed the internet overnight, is a testament to a lot of what I just mentioned. It's good to see that despite all the chatter after his beef with The Game and issues with Beanie, he can just concentrate on what matters most -- the foundation of his brand. Music.\n\nOn the cinematic album opener, \"On The Regular,\" Meek defiantly reminds all the haters that he isn't regular -- rightfully so. On records like \"Blessed Up,\" \"Shine,\" Meek does an excellent job of separating himself from the naysayers and bullshit. The definition of what 'starting at the bottom' means differs, although it's easy to lump all the interpretations together it together. Meek was really on the streets and worked his way up the ranks. On the aforementioned records, he mentioned a couple of things that resonated with me -- he truly acknowledges his blessings and realizes that there was likely more than a few close calls that could have ended his career before it popped. One line that I felt was \"If it weren't for this music I'd be probably dead.\" Real shit -- and he's lost people out here.\n\nThis mixtape does a great job of reasserting why many of us were all about Meek before he -- unintentionally -- gave Drake a chance to come out as a tough guy. In all honesty, though, it's fair to say that there isn't as much cross over in listeners as you may think -- Drake isn't a street rapper. Period. DC4 has crazy production, a-game contributions from the likes of Quavo, Thugger, Pusha T, and the late Lil' Snupe -- along with French Montana -- on the mixtape Outro. If you didn't like Milly before, you probably wouldn't like him now, but I'm not sure he cares. For those who either have been fans for a minute or are impartial in all the alienating and distracting non-music nonsense, DC4Life is a dope listen.\nPhilly stand up!\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JjqKDM4LScw\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TBVrs_6M_aw",

Not unlike iconic fellow Brooklynites like one-time Nas and Def Jam-affiliated Foxy Brown, and Biggie's right-hand lady Lil'Kim, she has an obvious sexy appeal -- actually, she gorgeous -- but she also has her bars up. Obviously driven by the mindset that most artists from the Big Apple in the 90s shared, she been busy working with name brand artists and producer on the completion of her buzz-worthy upcoming album The Red Carpet; with a handful of notable record under her belt, she just dropped her biggest track to date. The single and visual, \"Real Thing,\" features accomplished industry name Mack Wilds, whose transcended the music game, appearing in huge TV shows like 90210, and -- more notably -- as Michael Lee on the Baltimore-based HBO smash, The Wire.\n\nDirected by BmarFamous for the infamous Secret Social Motion Pictures, the video shows the super-sexy rapper going through relationship woes -- starting with the ending first (he conceding that the relationship is over), before showing us a look at once was, from smiles to shadiness. The overall tone has her asserting (assuming it's a personal record) her role as the ride or die, while the infectious hook defiantly states \"I'm looking for the real thing.\" The classy, high-quality video has serious potential -- and we wouldn't be surprised to hear the record getting some serious pick-up soon.\n\nGlamour Gurl Pearl has a lot going for her -- she's sexy without coming off as 'hyper sexual,' and she's nice with the pen. If all things fall into place the way her team hopes, she could be the next-best thing to bless the game from out of teh BK borough.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqK1_TXgulw&feature=youtu.be",

    "content_html": "[dropcap]F[/dropcap]irst off, excuse the unintentional pun in the title. Now, there's always been this hip-hop edge to Alicia Keys that I've loved; she has this beauty and grace about her, but her gorgeous vocals have a certain soulfulness to it that's hard to fake. Since she dropped \"<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Urdlvw0SSEc\">Fallen</a>,\" with a visual that followed the corn-rowed singer visiting her boyfriend in jail, the NYC songstress has been making an exuberant blend of both motivational and love songs from the perspective of the underdog -- that so happens also to appeal to the struggling dreamer in all of us. For day one fans, she's grown up -- but so have we; I remember bumping her debut album in my Discman while wearing a Durag and oversized throwback jersey. She's now a mother, wife, and actress, amongst other things. But no matter how much things change, she never seems to forget where she came from or lose the fundamental elements that birthed her musical nucleus in the first place. That could've been exemplified any better on <em>Here</em>, her highly anticipated new record that hit Apple Music this morning.\n\nThe album begins with a spoken-word piece, followed by \"The Gospel,\" an energetic piano driven record that stems from her upbringing Hell's Kitchen, Manhattan; \"...in my tenement, listening to the hook -- 'Change gon come,' spirit of Sam Cook.\" From here, without wavering too far from the aura of openness she creates, she explores a multitude of themes. They range from addiction (\"Illusion of Bliss\"), women's rights (\"Girl Can't Be Herself\"), to being a step parent on the A$AP Rocky-assisted \"Blended Family,\" which we saw a few weeks ago. Two standout records -- for me -- were \"Pawn It All,\" which floats themes of giving it all up and starting anew, and the über jazzy hip-hop infused \"She Don't Really Care.\" The latter's use of not only the classic \"<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6xE6ZWwJezg\">Bonita Applubum</a>\" break, and Nas's iconic Q-Tip produced \"<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxce_qvhi5I\">One Love</a>,\" but a subtle nod to UTFO's \"Roxanne Roxanne\" with her intro chant of \"oh yeah, oh yeah.\"\n\nAlicia Keys made headlines over the past months for not wearing makeup, which is bananas. She's a beautiful girl -- with or without it. This sentiment, which is a not so subtle commentary on the constraints the media and society place on women. \"Girl Can't Be Herself\" discusses how her heart breaks seeing girls who can't truly be themselves; \"Who says I should conceal what I'm made of -- maybe all this Maybelline is covering my self-esteem.\"\n\nThe album ends with \"Holy War,\" a heartfelt call to \"love somebody instead of polishing the bombs of holy war.\" The euphemism is used to describe the [racial, sexual, religious] segregation we as people have ultimately constructed. She questions near the song's end, \"what if love was holy, and war was obscene.\"\n\nThis record is an important one, and I honestly see it as Alicia Keys emitting a brand of truth, emotion, and power that is reminiscent of artists like Nina Simone. <em>Here </em>is a beautiful album, and a breath of fresh air. Thank you, Alicia.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=byTHi57uxBg\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3NwLTltmkoo",

    "content_html": "[dropcap]S[/dropcap]urrey, British Columbia, is the province's roughest city—in fact, in 2015, the city's crime rate had risen almost 36% as the result of a bloody gang war. Surrey is the birthplace of rapper POLO, who is a longtime friend and collaborator of producer Myles Anthony, whose recent string of singles, including a collaboration of G.O.O.D Music head honcho Pusha T, have graced our blog. \"Dude's the real deal in my opinion—and there's nothing out there but this,\" says Myles, when talking about his latest collaboration with POLO, the trap-tastic new record \"Out Here.\" The bassy street record is a stark contrast from the more worldly joints we've heard from Myles over the past few months; however, it displays how refreshingly well rounded he is. Also—TBH—the song is dripping with both authenticity and character.\n\nThe record, which displays POLO's true-to-life street raps, is a great example of what we can expect from his upcoming full-length project <i>Trapcouver</i>, which Myles is producing in its entirety. That record is due out sometime in the New Year; as well, Myle's full-length is coming down the pipe, and with every new single that drops, we get more anxious to hear his vision fully realized. Check out the new single below, and if you're feeling it mash the share button.\n\nhttps://www.soundcloud.com/mylesanthony/out-here-ft-polo",

    "content_html": "<blockquote>“We make music. Of course, with a Hip-Hop base but also sprinkled with Jazz, Funk, Dancehall, Rock, Folk, Salsa, etc. man. I mean, for real, the list goes on and on and on—and on! We love art…but we hate labels!”\n—Yellow Cloud</blockquote>\n[dropcap]W[/dropcap]ashington, DC, duo Yellow Cloud have a cool vibe about them. Former bandmates—and longtime friends—TreeLag and Nick Wood have a 90s hip-hop aesthetic, infused with live jazz instrumentation and contemporary rhyme schemes to great their unique new wave. Their latest record, \"Work Fa Mi,\" is not that unfamiliar thematically, but the jazzy saxophone kissed instrumental vibe give it an unusually vintage feel; as does the video, which reminds us of classic 90s house party videos, like Notorious B.I.G's \"One More Chance,\" for example.\n\nTaking time out from creating, the duo sat with AAHH to discuss their music, their influences, and what they have coming up on the horizon. Check out the video—and their interview—below.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ua3EFEXfrBo\n\n<b>Tell me about yourself -- what got you involved in music? </b>\n\n<b>Nick Wood</b>: I couldn't even tell you. I mean, it must be my family. I've been involved in music as long as I can remember.\n\n<b>TreeLag</b>: I think music got me involved in life! I don't know what got me involved in music because I've always been involved in music. I mean, I was born with a song I still jam to today – it was played by my uncle. Music has just always been a part of me and my life.\n\n<b>Coming into this game, who did you look up to?</b>\n\n<b>N</b>: When I first started rapping, I was all about Lil Wayne and Dipset. They made music fun, and my friends and I knew all their lyrics. But my first real personal inspiration to make this music came from seeing A Tribe Called Quest live. They motivated me in a way I didn't know possible. Q-Tip became my father.\n\n<b>T</b>: [Laughs], for real. I looked up to people like Queen, Journey, Michael\nJackson, The Temptations, Bob Marley and Peter Tosh. The way these musicians performed and impacted the world is something so powerful to me. Talking about the rap game specifically, though, I was looking up to Dipset, Big Pun, Hot Boyz, TRU, Bone Thugs, the old Terror Squad, and Fugees! I grew up in the 90s with mad older role models who were bumping that fire! I—for real—always looked up to Bone Thugs and especially Bizzy Bone! Then, when we got to go on tour with him, it was like a dream come true! He was even like \"Damn, that dude got flow,\" talking about ya boy right here after he seeing us perform with technical difficulties and still keeping the place live and bumpin! \n\n<b>Tell me about your music; what have you released thus far? </b>\n\n<b>N</b>: The releases have just begun. We debuted our single, \"Straight Out the Dungeon\" back in July, followed by this video for \"Work Fa Mi.\" Now that we've established a groove we can start to release the dozens of singles we have in store. Those are coming up as soon as y'all watch \"Work Fa Mi\" enough.\n\n<b>T</b>: Oooooooooh baby! Yeah, like Nasty said, the releases have just begun! We got projects with our famo in DC at FHTMG and Les Autres, our international fam in Cuba, Malcolm Beybe, and so many singles, visuals, merch and full-on films for y'all! Get at our <a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/yellowcloudproductions\">Facebook</a> and <a href=\"http://www.instagram.com/yellowcloud202\">IG</a> pages to stay updated.\n\n<b>What are you working on right now?</b>\n\n<b>N</b>: Finishing the project, <i>Treezus vs. the Magnificent</i>. I also have a solo EP that should be done in a couple of months; and one of our associates, Brandon Moulden, has a project coming up that I'm producing for. Very excited about that. There's [also] further collaborations with Alpha Diallo of Les Autres, as well as Pacman Slim of FHTMG. We got mad projects with FHTMG.\n\n<b>T</b>: <i>TREEZUS vs. THE MAGNIFICENT</i>!!! Haha, it's gonna be amazing! Also, got some more projects on the way, like I said, with our DC famo as well as our international familia! I got a few classics, accompanied by visuals, done with Malcolm Beybe's Escobar and Saez! (two amazing rappers out of Parraga in La Habana, Cuba). Also got a solo project in stores, with some very different and fun vibes fi y'all! Finally, a project with OJALA. Yellow Cloud will be entirely official and taking over the scene within the next year, baby!\n\n<b>Let's talk about this video -- where was it filmed? Why are you excited about it? </b>\n\n<b>N</b>: It was filmed in Philly, where I just moved away from. I'm just so excited about finally putting it out! It's our highest quality video to date. That's why I only mentioned two songs before because this new stuff is really on a whole different level as far as professional quality. I also love the team we worked with, Unchained Media, and their director Dan Foster. I love their style that they brought to the video; it's very cinematic. And retro. It reminds me a bit of how Goodfellas was filmed.\n\n<b>T</b>: WATCH THAT SHIT! [Laughs], for real! Nasty explained most of it, shoutout Unchained Media! This is our very first single released off our upcoming album and comes with a visual... I'm just excited as shit it all happened! Can't wait for y'all to see all the rest!\n\n<b>What have been your biggest accomplishments to date? </b>\n\n<b>N</b>: Staying alive [laughs]. Nah, but I'm always proud to be putting out music that's constantly improving. Every project I put out is better than the last. I teach music as well, so I'm happy to be able to have that balance. I practice what I preach. As a team we're building a very solid footing, so to speak. We have so much in store we're just focused on how we present it right now.\n\nT: [Laughs] I don't like to talk personal. What I will say, is that I feel my biggest accomplishment has been getting to where I am right now! I'm alive, healthy, in love, and making music with all the homies. Yellow Cloud is coming along, and I can't complain. I feel pretty accomplished; so much more work to be done, but I'm psyched that I'm here!\n\n<b>What do you want people to ultimately take away from you as an artist? </b>\n\n<b>N</b>: Authenticity. I mean that's what's always important in art. That and the effort. Both are evident in this video. That's why it's a good starting point for y'all to get to know us. Yellow Cloud is real; we represent the people.\n\n<b>T</b>: JUST MY ART, Leave me alone! [Laughs]. I ultimately want people to\nget any feeling at all. I make my music when I'm happy, sad, mad, feeling fun,\ngroovin', etc., and I just want to keep making more for people to explore themselves and possibly gain some sense of understanding; and if they\ndon't, at least just bop their heads playing one of our jams over and over again. Then I can die a happy artist!\n\n<b>What's next for you professionally? </b>\n\n<b>N</b>: See question number 4. We have projects; we're working on putting them out. And we're still working on new projects. I have a growing base of\npeople I'm mixing for and producing for so that all leads to more collaboration.\nIt's all just getting started.\n\n<b>T</b>: I explained a lot of the work in progress and shit that I/we got in store, but y'all ain't hip to my eyes baby! Once the money gets up and I can get my hands on a decent camera, y'all ain't even gonna be ready! YELLOW CLOUD PRODUCTIONS IN FULL EFFECT! The shit I see, and how I see it, ain't something you see on the daily. Even without a cam of my own, I still manage, though, and we'll be releasing some Treezus produced material soon. I also have a lot of design work I'm working on, so keep a look out for Yellow Cloud and Treezus gear!\n\nSpeaking of, Yellow Cloud tees will be available no later than Nov. 10th, and pics will be posted on our FB and IG pages. If you are interested in any merch or have any questions about booking, featuring, etc., please feel free to contact us.\nemail us at yellowcloudproductions@gmail.com.",

    "content_html": "[dropcap]A[/dropcap]s a preface, I've seen a few writers cover this topic over the years, but the sheer amount of blank stares the conversation elicits on my part suggests that revisiting it wouldn't be such bad idea. I've made it no secret in the past that I'm a vinyl head. I spent many a sunny afternoon in my rip-roaring 20s digging for vinyl at my local record spots. One day, while digging in a leaky store basement through some bargain bins I came across a 12\" called \"Nobody Rides For Free,\" by Biggie Smallz. The Z--for whatever reason-- didn't seem weird. Being that it was from some no name record label, I assumed I'd stumbled upon some gold. I headed back to the lab, naturally excited, only to pop it on and realize this was not--in fact--the portly rapper better known as the Notorious B.I.G, but a relatively unknown white rapper from LA who shared the same name.\n\nMy first question was, how can this be? Well, apparently, he is one of three Biggies that exist. This one guy was, unbelievably, connected to the late-great prolific rap icon Tupac Shakur. The artist was working with Pac's go-to producer Johnny J--who had produced well over 100 tracks with Pac. Johnny saw Biggie was starting to blow up, so he asked Pac if--as a favor to him--he could ask Biggie to change his name to help avoid market confusion. Unbelievably, Puff let that happen. Well, Biggie Smallz had only really released three records before he was tragically murdered in 1994 outside of a liquor store; however, there aren't many--or rather, any--details outside of these records about his backstory, which makes him quite mysterious. Unfortunately all his seemingly closest associates are all dead.\n\nAs I mentioned, there was also ANOTHER Biggie Smalls, who also went by Big Dirk. Dirk was a member of the Live Squad, who Pac also linked with; Big Stretch was also part of this crew. Unfortunately, Dirk passed away before him and Pac could collaborate, but his death helped to spark one of the most cited pieces of audio proof that Pac's death was seemingly faked -- notably, the intro where Pac says \"rest in peace to my motherfucking nigga Biggie Smalls.\" It's been noted Shock G and a few others in Pac's circle that this was, in fact, a salute to Dirk.\n\nWell, this rabbit hole of hip-hop knowledge is ultimately brought to you by Biggie Smallz, so I'll leave a few of his records below. Random, amazing.\n\nRIP Johnny J, Pac, Dirk, and Biggie Smallz.\n\nKeep Digging.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykEGDlJar-A\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVp9Ayz4B8s",

He comes off optically as a blend of Odd Future and A$AP Mobb, by that I mean, he is straight up bars, but he has just the right amount of darkness and mystery to him. I feel like his music doesn't tell me too much about him, but it's just enough--which I understand is hard to explain.\n\nAs I mentioned the last time I wrote about him, I get the vibe from NXUS; he has something about him--you can just feel that he's headed along the right incline.

He figured out at an early age that not everyone has your best interest in mind--and that strongly dissuaded him from joining a gang/selling drugs/robbing/etc. “That stuff is a culture in southern California,” he explains, “plus I wasn't going to end up as a casualty for anyone’s war plan except mine.”\n\nHere he stands today, hot on the heels of his latest single, “Innocent,” featuring the West Coast icon Too $hort. It’s the type of feature that no only demands attention, but commands respect by sheer association. Not to mention, he’s produced for legends, and had his music appear on the critically acclaimed CW show “The Flash.”\n\nHe recently took some time to chat with AAHH about his music, his goals, and more. Check out the single, and the interview below.\n\nhttps://soundcloud.com/youngdecadez/decadez-ft-too-short-innocent\n\n<strong>Tell me about your music -- describe your sound.</strong>\n\nMy sound is ‘wavey.’ We've coined it ‘Good Vibe Music’ because it has a positive feeling to it. All of my music has a mood behind it. My music usually relies heavily on catchy melodies and unique sounds. In terms of me as a artist, you'll hear me bending words to rhyme or stretching them to make them more melodic. My structure is kind of unorthodox. I attack songs strictly off of feeling while most artist carefully write and plan out.\n\n<strong>How did you get involved in music?</strong>\n\nI got involved with music at a young age. When i was a very young kid, around the age of about three or four, I was in church choir. Then I started out freestyle battling in junior high and just shredded every opponent all the way through graduating high school. I think in a way that's how I initially developed a fan base.\n\n<strong>Who/what were some of your influences?</strong>\n\nMy biggest influences would be artist like E-40, Aaliyah, Ginuwine, Tupac and Drake. I feel like they constantly push the bar creatively and melodically. I sat in the studio a lot [when I was younger] with 40 and he always coached me with my songwriting as well as recording. Not only did he coach me musically, he is a good dude in general. I always credit him and Mugzi (his brother) for keeping me on the right path and influencing me to be a better person overall.\n\n<strong>What have you released?</strong>\n\nI've released quite a few projects in the last couple of years but the most notable would be The Heatrock 2, Operation Money,Training Day and Broadcasting Live From Ratchet City.\n\n<strong>What are you currently working on?</strong>\nI'm currently working on a RnB/Pop Album titled <em>GVM</em> (which stands for Good Vibe Music)--Innocent is the lead single for. I am also working on a untitled rap album as well. In addition to that I'm a producer so I'm working with various on their projects too.\n\n<strong>What have been some of your biggest achievements thus far?</strong>\n\nMy biggest achievements to date is producing E-40 and Too $hort’s single featuring Tyga titled \"<a href=\"https://www.google.ca/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0ahUKEwizhOfTh6HQAhUT_WMKHUkyCoYQyCkIIDAA&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3D45egZZxcTQw&usg=AFQjCNF06ykJE-Yh-SFmVUPXT9pXAHRVuA&sig2=xlHpuHTy_Ko0xbxAJM2h0A\">Slide Through</a>.\" It really was an honor to work with such legendary artists and create a song that was such a big wave in Cali. Another one of my biggest achievements is having one of my songs (from my upcoming rap album) titled Get It All featured on the CW's “The Flash.”\n\n<strong>What are your goals in the industry?</strong>\n\nMy goal in the industry is to continue to put out great music and grow my fan base. I want to create hit records that people can enjoy for decades to come.\n\n<strong>What's next for you, professionally?</strong>\n\nI'll continue creating and crafting music. You should expect to hear more records that I've produced, as well as hear my songs in TV and Film. We also are currently charting on Internet Radio as well as being spun on College Radio. We should eventually be on FM and from there you should expect things to continue to grow in scale.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W9g25zgeY_g\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45egZZxcTQw",

    "excerpt": null,
    "content_html": "Listening to the newest Tribe Called Album is a strange experience. I liken it to the final episode of Fresh Prince. ATCQ have always seemed like the most amazing, compelling, innovative and revered novel in its genre that just happened to have the last few chapters ripped out; that was the case, until early this morning. Following and emotional re-connection, a handful of performances and an undeniable demand from longtime fans, <em>We Got It From Here, Thank You 4 Your Service</em> finally hit [digital] shelves. It is the first focused studio album from the quartet since 1998's <em>The Love Movement</em> and unfortunately, following the heartbreaking loss of Phife, their final collective effort.\n\nWhen discussion of a possibility of an album first floated following their handful of festival appearances, Phife was quoted as saying, \"Man, we was only 18–19 when we first got started. [When] We broke up we were still like 28. Now we are 35-36. It'd be real different being in the studio. It would be real interesting to see where Q-Tip is. It would all be on a much higher level.\" His instinct was correct—<em>We Got It From Here</em> is a smorgasbord of production sensibility that pushes the musicality of the overall product. It seems to appeal to more to <em>Midnight Marauders</em> frame of mind than the darker 'Umma' sound that the group explored on <em>The Love Movement</em>. The project feels like a family reunion, with the original crew (including Jarobi) on deck, as well Consequence and Busta Rhymes. It's a combination of political, socially conscious content blended in with some of the lovable sucker emcee squashing bars we grew to love back in their heyday.\n\nThere are a few guest spots, though. Outkast and Tribe may not have gotten it together to do their joint album, but we do get an Andre 3000 siting. On \"Kids,\" 3 Stacks laments \"Kids don't you know that all this shit is fantasy?\" Meanwhile, Tip and Cons speak from a kid's perspective while dropping gems on them, it's a cool concept. And that's not all; Anderson Paak pops up on \"Movin Backwards\" and Phife, Kendrick Lamar team up for \"Conrad Tokyo,\" which is an incredible song, and Talib Kweli and Kanye West appear on \"Killing Season.\" It's hip-hop history all over this album—no collaborations are out of place.\n\nWhile the project delivers everything fans have been dreaming about—and more—there are a few moments that resonated especially well with me. Phife's verse on \"Black Spasmodic\" which kicks off with \"Who want it with the Trini Gladiator...\" and the cohesive chemistry on \"Dis Generation\" have all the elements I've always loved about Tribe over the years. The album doesn't pretend that Phife is still here, though. Much like the lauded D.I.T.C album that dropped almost two-decade ago, there is a 'tribute' of sorts to their fallen comrade, \"Lost Somebody.\"\n\nIt all comes down to \"The Donald,\" the album's final record. Phife asserts his status, calling out any emcee who believe they can beat him in a battle. The record is built around him and almost puts me in mind of classic 80s jams where the crew talked about how dope their DJ was (see \"<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TP8zFBryUqU\">Jam Master Jay</a>\" or \"<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MeeINjdaLMo\">I Wanna Rock</a>\"). As Busta chants \"Phife Dawg\" for the last time, the curtains close on a chapter of hip-hop that will never actually be duplicated. To round back to my original \"Fresh Prince\" allusion, it feels like the final scene after Will and Carlton hug for the last time—a final goodbye. The album is a wonderful way to honor Phife's memory for generations to come while giving longtime fans, like me, one last ride on the vibe bus. I have been a fan of Tribe since I was (literally) a child and their music has stuck with me throughout my adult life. They're my Beatles, in a sense. So as much as my initial listen gave me feels, it's quickly going to become a staple in my collection. I can't wait until my pre-order vinyl comes.\n\nFarewell, Phife—and salute to the whole circle. \"Linden Blvd., represent, represent.\"\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLuOHqmtauo\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjowfzlbx5s",

    "content_html": "[dropcap]W[/dropcap]hy we--as writers-- don't classify NYC street-hop as its own subgenre, alongside drill music, is beyond me. I'm not talking that back pack rap that more introspective [undergournd] outfits like Pro Era rarely sway from. I'm talking the gritty NYC shit, that has--over the years--grown to encompass it's own youthful blend of trap, slow, bassy rap/sing compositions and even some straight up hip-hop. All this, captured within that raw energy and perspective that only comes from roaming the streets of NYC with your hoody up and your pockets full of dirty money. Brooklyn-based rapper LuCkii checks off a lot of the boxes. With a catalog that dates back roughly four years, he has been quite consistent. Some of the record I've come across, like the radio-ready \"Never Cared,' which sees him singing over a slow-flow record that could easily fit into the contemporary mainstream rotation, and the more grimy \"Under The Influence,\" show an impressive range that manages to stay true to his city. He reminds of some of the Big Apple's other youthful heavy hitters, like Troy Ave.\n\nHe recently took a brief Q&A for AAHH, which you can see below--this kid has some potential; check a out selection of career (video) highlights I've picked out.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rTsqVtb-I4\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WMbWlQRu0yo\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUq7dEu3Zo4\n\n<hr />\n\n<strong>Where were you born--and how did you get into music?\n</strong>\nI was born in Queens, New York. However, I bounced around a few boroughs--even Long Island. I now reside in Brooklyn. I've been making music for 15+ years now; I started when I was 10.\n\n<strong>How would you describe your music?\n</strong>\nWhen you listen to my music, and the [vibe] and feeling of my tracks, you can feel me because it's real shit. But--most importantly--I drop gems [knowledge].I don't wanna give away too many secrets; you gotta just listen.\n\n<strong>Who are your influences?\n</strong>\nI grew up listening to Missy, Jay-Z, Stack Bundles [RIP], Max B; those were the biggest influences on me.\n\n<strong>What's coming up for you?\n</strong>\nRight now, I'm finishing up a 5 song EP which is untitled--but, it's done. Just going through the mixing process. I recently released two songs on soundcloud \"X-Files\" and \"Never Cared.\" Also, I have a big a announcement coming soon; stay tuned.\n\n<hr />\n\n<iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https://api.soundcloud.com/tracks/273853464&color=ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false\" width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" frameborder=\"no\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe>\n\n<iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https://api.soundcloud.com/tracks/291969721&color=ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false\" width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" frameborder=\"no\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe>",

    "content_html": "<blockquote>\"I'll rock the mic—and ether the beat myself, no features.\"\n--Dusah Spade</blockquote>\n[dropcap]I[/dropcap] consider true \"street-rap\" to have a fine line between real life and fantasy; the line in the sand is [generally] easy to smell. Acts like NWA--for example--were so vivid, and so over the top, that you'd have to be a little nieve not to question its authenticity. On the flipside acts like Beanie Siegle and Shyne were bout that life. ATL based rapper Dusah Spade is a rapper that flew across my desk this week, and his music has a very comfortable amount of realness to it, with a 90s sense of aggressiveness that a lot of these youngsters don't seem to grasp. His mixtape, The Flipside, is a collection of original joints spliced into a series of dubs that have a ton of character.\n\nWith a cadence that almost resembles Cassidy (with a little more bass to it)--listen to his Sho'Nuff Freestyle as an example. Dusah traverses a gambit of topical content, like \"No Problems,\" where he calls out fake rappers to staying true to himself on \"Neva Change.\" This project--one a whole-- has a deceivingly New York vibe to it, especially on the record \"Flipside,\" with its recognizable drum pattern, set off with his bar for bar punchline flow. As a package, this mixtape sounds like it's from 2003-2005 (in a good way); primarily, it's that he doesn't overuse the contemporary trap vibe that dominates most of the stuff that inundates my inbox on the daily. In fact, he only does so on the record \"Cake,\" which is a big record. Probably top 5 on the project.\n\nSome of the highlights for me include the last record, \"Holiday,\" with a sample that resembles Yeezy's \"New Slaves.\" He also has some hype 'freestyles' worth mentioning, such as \"Open Letter.\" Some may not remember the beat as one of the lost records from Foxy Brown's ill-fated Ill Na Na 2; he drops bars like, \"senseless, what we do for the cheddar, come on son, yo we gotta do better,\" a commentary on the wicked times we're living in. He also does a contrastingly low-profile version of the Young M.A. hit, OOOUUU, \"I been there and done that--I'm from a place where niggas don't come back.\"\n\nComing up in a struggling household of drugs, alcohol, and other deep family issues, Hip-Hop has always been his escape; his record is a healthy balance of cautionary jewels, 'I'm here you're not' isms and hip-hop-ish that heads who are fans of the East Coast mixtape scene will--and should--welcome with open arms. He's unique if you consider he's in a city that is currently championed by acts like Gucci and Future. Dusah Spade has some tracks, for sure. Worth a spin. Check the mixtape, and if you're feeling it, mash the share button.\n\n<iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/playlists/272218657&color=ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false\" width=\"100%\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"no\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe>",

    "content_html": "<blockquote>\"I'm on some new shit, 2016; you wanna rap? Shit, I got about 2000 16s.\"\n--Tone Chop</blockquote>\n[dropcap]A[/dropcap] quick skim through some of Tone Chop's music, it's not surprising to hear he has a background battling back in the 90s--his flow is an artifact of the heyday of hip-hop when rappers had distinctive cadences and biting was the wackest thing anyone could do. His voice and actual appearance are quite jarring, as you wouldn't think they were one in the same—not unlike the first time Your Old Droog revealed himself, but Tone has easily become one of my top rhymers to watch after being put onto him earlier this month. Along with his longtime partner, producer Frost Gamble, he's blessed real heads with a solid EP, Veteran, full of dope loops and rewind worthy gems.\n\nFrost, who currently reside north of the border in Winnipeg, Manitoba, dumbs out on the MPC with head-nodding instrumentals, like \"Other Shit,\" where Chop and guest Awful P trade 16s on a gritty sound bed that features a Showbiz sampled hook. Then there's \"Leave It Alone,\" a tribute to the late rapper Sean Price, featuring [P's] Duck Down label mate Ruste Juxx and Queens rapper Nobi—<a href=\"http://aboveaveragehiphop.com/queens-rapper-nobi-drops-integritty-3/\">who we've written about before</a>. My personal highlight on this record is \"Step Up,\" with a Mr. T sample in the hook, and an eerie vibe, Tone Chop blacks out. His slight lisp, his flow, and his bars [\"If I ain't nice, shit, a T-Rex ain't a dinosaur\"] make this song incredible.\n\nWhat I like most about this EP is that it has a timeless appeal to it—it ignores everything that's currently running the scene, and seem to make no time specific references. Much of the EP could very well have been uncovered from studio reels back in 1997 and then re-mastered. It's solid, devoid of filler, and an exciting appetizer for their new LP planned for 2017. Worth a spot on your playlist!\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvt5dKatyTE\n\n<iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/playlists/276049891&color=ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false\" width=\"100%\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"no\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe>",

    "content_html": "<blockquote>\"A solid R&B album from a singer who's been nothing but consistent for over two decades.\"</blockquote>\n[dropcap]J[/dropcap]oe has always been--in my humble opinion--consistent as a singer. From his New Jack Swing soaked debut album, to his slew of incredibly notable guest features, to his constant club and radio presence at the turn of the century; he has yet to disappoint me as a listener and has had the fortune of being part of records that keep ringing after all these years. An example was his classic chorus on his 1997 song \"<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUc7MWJjN5k\">Don't Want To Be A Player</a>\" off of the Booty Call OST that became the iconic hook on the remix to Big Punisher's platinum-selling [mainstream] debut single, \"<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7OdZ7vsTak\">Still Not A Player</a>.\" Or how about his <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-aKKwRXLRkE\">collaborations with G-Unit</a>, or the early 2000s club staple \"<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eGY_Qqr2Lm0\">Stutter</a>?\"\n\nI digress, though. He's had so many solo hits over the years, amassed numerous Grammy nominations, murdered the charts [in his day], and has sold millions upon million of records. Since 2008, he's been releasing independent albums, and just last week, he greeted fans with what Gucci Mane describes as his last album on their radio-ready collaboration, \"Happy Hour.\" <em>#MYNAMEISJOETHOMAS</em> is Joe's 12th studio album, and--if it's true--a wonderful way to cap off an incredible 23-year career in the game. Joe's distinctive vocals don't at all disappoint on this record. There's a little of everything here. The aforementioned Gucci joint, \"Don't Lock Me Out,\" the contemporary \"Can't Run From Love, \" and the disco-tinged \"Celebrate You\" are up-tempo records that could quickly become playlist candy for DJs. There's also records like \"So I Can Have You Back,\" which has Joe singing to the 'one who got away,' or \"Love Centric,\" which is reminiscent of R.Kelly's \"Turn Back The Hand Of Time.\"\n\nHe also has two dope covers to round out the album, a take on Al Green's Kanye sampled \"A Little Tenderness\" (\"Our Anthem\") and Adele's hit record, \"Hello.\" Overall, it's a solid R&B album from a singer who's been nothing but consistent for over two decades. Worth a listen for anyone who's ever considered themselves even a moderate fan of the singer.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PILUSeb18ho\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SmAnKQrcb4",

The group has since dissolved, but Hodgy, like his [maybe ex] brethren is stepping out on the ledge by himself with his first official solo debut album, <i>Fireplace: TheNotTheOtherSide</i>, on Columbia. With guest spots from Lil Wayne, Busta Rhymes and Salomon Faye to production from BadBadNotGood, Unknown Mortal Orchestra, Knxwledge, 88-Keys Nottz, Rahki, Jonti and more, the project is a diverse and eclectic introduction to a Hodgy we haven't yet met—mature and worldly. As he describes it, “My debut album is gratefully my past to present. Same time I had got my solo deal, around the time me and my child’s mother were at wit’s end, I was in search for a higher ground.”\n\nBut it's nothing—he's already light years past this album. A collaborative album with Nelly Furtado in the works and he is currently putting together the pieces for another MellowHype project, all while envisioning his sophomore album.\n\nWhile you wait for your pre-order, dropping December 9th, you can watch the new video/single \"Barbell,\" which is an amazing appetizer for the main course.

DJ Clue, for example, was once a mysterious presence on the scene, as was Joe Budden, who had yet to make any public reveal while climbing the ranks on the mixtape circuit. Then a few years ago, Your Old Droog had industry vets betting their livelihoods on the fact that his true identity was actual Nas. Well, last month, we had another bonafide mystery; H.E.R hit the scene with an INSANE new record, consigned by names like Alicia Keys and Wyclef, that quickly shit to the top of the iTunes charts. It was revealed soon after, though, that she was none other than talented up and coming Alicia Keys protégée, Gabi Wilson.\n\nMuch like the mystery that once surrounded another superstar singer, The Weeknd, it proved to be incredibly successful commercially. We can now expect Gabi to do big things from here.\n\nHowever, it looks like we have another shadowy voice on our hands, H.I.M. There is no information available on him, but it has [urban] conspiracy theorists wondering if he is connected to Gabi in some way, or rather just a clever singer who adopted her concept at the right time? Either way, it will be a fun ride towards an ultimate reveal.\n\nH.I.M has dropped a seven-song EP—how does it stack up to H.E.R?

While the genre's use of the term 'alternative' has grown to include acts like Chance The Rapper or even—at one point—Lil'B, I choose to use it the way it was originally conceived. That was, to describe acts against the grain, disrupting hegemony like De La Soul or Arrested Development.\n\nEon MC Etc. And Adduci [originally] hail from different parts of the country, but come together with a unique style that both contrasts and compliments in harmonious balance. Their new project, Fighting Demons, seems to be ripe with symbolism, Lyricist Lounge-esque poetry aesthetic, spiritual undertones, and a unique thematic direction. The project kicks off with a seething commentary on 'false prophets' with \"Apocalypse,\" packed with bars and 8-bar hooks that depict a pastor dripping in anti-church hypocrisy. Highlights here are joints like \"Lady Liberty,\" where they drop lines like \"Dear Lady Liberty, got a special delivery, a weapon of mass destruction for the corruption and tyranny.\" Then there's the outro, \"Lonely Highway,\" with its eerie atmosphere, and deep bars.\n\nIt's hard to describe adequately without simply retyping all the lyrics, but bar-wise, this project is super ill. Eon MC Etc.'s verse on \"Ghetto Birds,\" for example, show how seasoned he is—this is by no means an amateur project. It's a gem, real talk.\n\nWhat stood out was their 8-minute mini-movie/video for \"Grindin' In My Zone,\" with its chorus that chastises non-unique heads that come with that mediocre bullshit. The video depicts the duo as what I understand to be demon hunters who are attending some anything goes demon party. It's incredibly well-executed and quite impressive.\n\nOverall, it's a unique project in a sea of shit that is trying way too hard to fit in. Worth a listen for anyone who is a fan of acts with the courage to keep it real and be themselves; Fighting Demons is AAHH approved.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vlrz2xOcPc0",

    "content_html": "<blockquote>\"It's the incredible, your girl will say I'm edible--and to these rap cats I'm something that theoretical.\" --Roy O.</blockquote>\n[dropcap]R[/dropcap]oy O. (pronounced 'Roy-ol') is a Texas-based indie hip-hop artist by way of Nigeria. He dropped his first mixtape back in 2011 and hasn't stopped to catch his breath since; he's since released “The Royolty”, a highly acclaimed mixtape, and his first exclusive album “HUE”, which boasts an [impressive] feature from Houston’s own Scarface, from the legendary Geto Boys. His latest project, “SCRATCH,” is cover mixtape that touches on the essence of hip hop. \"It [the mixtape] embodies many meanings,\" he explains on his SoundCloud, \"at its deepest, Scratch means the freedom from the need to be perfect, freedom from the need to have it all figured out. We all want to get somewhere in life and a lot of times we overlook the beauty of the journey there. Life is a journey, a creative process of trial and error, and there is beauty in accepting that.\"\n\nAt eight songs--plus an intro-- the project is a great mix of vibes. From the bar for bar punchy wordplay on \"Far From Falling,\" a reworked version of \"Dead Wrong,\" to his versions of Ice Cube's \"Check Yourself\" and Kanye's \"30 Hours\" from his critically hailed Pablo album. What's dope is that he makes each beat his own, rather that allow the original songs to dictate his flow and direction. He also chose a well-curated batch of beats, rather than a more contemporary/predictable palet with records like \"Panda\" or \"Ooohhh.\" The organic nature of this collection of songs also shines through--this is likely because nothing was written. \"This mixtape was constructed over many miles on Houston freeways and in Houston traffic, freestyling to instrumentals,\" he's quick to point out, \"It includes outtakes from recording sessions, off-key singing, lyrically and a humble acceptance that makes it refreshing.\"\n\nWith a hint of soul that is almost reminiscent of Chance The Rapper mashed with Anderson Paak, Roy O. delivers a healthy appetizer to whatever it is he has up his sleeve for the new year. For now, enjoy the stacks of bars he's served up on fine china. Rewind worthy, most definitely.\n\n<iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/playlists/272541337&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true\" width=\"100%\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"no\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe>",

    "content_html": "[dropcap]O[/dropcap]rcutt--California--producer <a href=\"http://aboveaveragehiphop.com/laid-back-soul-beats-by-tyrellevitiello/\">TyrelleVitiello</a> has been dropping smooth hip-hop instrumentals into our inbox for a while now; we thought it was only right to help our super-dope readers learn a little bit more about the incredibly underrated beatmaker. Check out the Q&A below, and peep his work below.\n\n<hr />\n\n<strong>How did you get involved in music?\n</strong>\nI started making music as a kid, playing different percussion instruments and moved on from drums to drum pads early in high school. My very closest friends and I, at the time, were just enjoying ourselves and made music for us to dig. As things moved on it became much more than just a hobby, at least for some of us.\n\n<strong>How would you describe it?\n</strong>\nMy music is a very vibrational and melodic sort of hip-hop. I like to refer to it as 'smooth-hop' in fact. I focus on using soft and appealing samples, influenced by alot of jazz & bossa nova, tied together with some 90's style drums.\n\n<strong>Who are your influences?\n</strong>\nRegarding musical influences, artists like Yusef Lateef/ Mos Def / Marvin Gaye / Binary Star / Stan Getz / Astrud Gilberto & and a ton of others to be honest.\n\n<strong>What have you dropped so far?\n</strong>\nIn the last year, I've probably had about 20 releases, 11 of which are still available online, and the most notable of which being my most recent release 'afthrs'. It reached almost 13k plays in just a couple weeks and continues to attract new listeners.\n\nhttps://soundcloud.com/tyrelle-vitiello/afthrs\n\nCurrently, I am working on putting together a tour! The launch will be late March of 2017, but the details are on the DL as of now. Very exciting. Aside from that, I'll be releasing a beat tape entitled 'the rtrotape' this holiday season, and will be playing quite a few venues on the Central Coast between now and March. To keep up with show dates, email-exclusive music, and things of the sort visit tyrellevitiellomusic.com\n\n<strong>What's been your biggest achievement thus far?\n</strong>\nSome of my greatest achievements thus far would have to be the extent of my travels by this point. I've had the opportunity to go to places in the world that I have always desired to, and involve my music career cohesively. They--in fact--very much compliment one another, my desire and passion for producing and performing music, as well as my love of travel and experience. I've worked with artists, collectives, and businesses from Baltimore to San Fransisco to Pensacola to Los Angeles. Coffee houses in Atlanta, and art studios in Santa Barbara. Collaboration is something I take pride in focusing on.\n\n<strong>What's your biggest goal?\n</strong>\nA goal of mine right now is to play a roof-top show in Europe at sunset, very soon. I am definitely working on making that happen.\n\n<strong>What's Next?\n</strong>\nThe release of '<em>the rtrotape</em>' just in time for the holidays, a full version of My Website will be up on January 1st--big day. I'll be heading to Seattle January 28, so stay tuned on-line and perhaps catch me at a show!\n\n<iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/users/164345519&color=ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false\" width=\"100%\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"no\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe>",

    "content_html": "<blockquote>\"They chasing a hit, I'm chasing legacy.\"— Smoke Dza</blockquote>\n[dropcap]I[/dropcap] was actual sworn to secrecy about the existence of the much hyped \"Don't Smoke Rock\" all the way back in January 2016. However, I wasn't provided with any preview content, so I had to wait it out with the townspeople for this gleaming piece of New York street art. I use the word art purposely--and unapologetically--as this project is drenched in organic dopeness that can't be bought. Like most of the best collaborative producer/MC projects we've heard over the past decade, <em>Don't Smoke Rock</em> stemmed from a song that worked so well the two (Smoke Dza and Pete Rock) decided to see how deep the rabbit hole goes; spoiler, it goes deep [pause]. What it's culminated into is a thirteen-song ride on the East Coast side of things with a cast of guests that commands respect--from MMG capo Ricky Rozay and Detroit bar-god Royce Da 5'9 to Dza's fellow Harlemite Cam'Ron. Of course, those are amongst a host of others.\n\nThe intro sets it up as a stark contrast the gentrified [Harlem, New York] of today. Rather, it's a reflection of the gritty streets that were visualized through street-tales by fallen greats like Big L. Production wise, Pete Rock sounds as hungry as he did when he dropped PeteStrumentals back in 2001--he looks refreshed and re-focused. Two of my highlights remain the singles that dropped with the pre-order, \"Limitless\" with Dave East and \"Milestone\" featuring Jada, Styles, and BJ The Chicago Kid. There was also a certain level of dopeness hearing Wale over PR production on \"Show Off.\"\n\nIf you've been sleeping on the Kush God, this project is the epitome of what the five fingers said to the face--a yank at the collar and an assertion of dominance. He understandably has more to gain from this pairing, even if the sonic-marriage seems leveled out. He's managed to awake a sleepy giant who produced a monster record from intro to soulful outro; I'd be shocked if this album wasn't considered a career-highlight, even years from now. \"New York City, make some noise for your sounds.\"\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W900MEGJ46U",

They are both quite different from each other, providing more insight into his environment and past than we've seen thus far in his freestyles. The first of the two records, \"Front Door,\" is a look into the mind of a trapper who is a product of his environment; the song is [perhaps] a glimpse into his past pre-rap-life rap focus. \"I remember being broke and having no hope...serving fiends right at that corner store.\" There is usually only a few ways out of that life, the song is both a street-kid anthem and celebration of advancement.\n\nThe second record, \"Dade County,\" is an ode to his stomping grounds--which happens to be one of the top 20 most dangerous cities in America. The slow, bassy record features fellow Miami rapper L.E.O., an artist and painter who is also starting to bubble; you can check out his <a href=\"http://vimeo.com/157779408\">short film here</a> if you're interested.\n\nAs usual, we're digging his stuff.

Interestingly, though, the untimely deaths of some of the South's most prominent contributors to the culture—the iconic DJ Screw and Pimp C of UGK—hasn't seemed to at all curb the appetite of hip-hop's obsession with the legendary purple drink. Consuming lean is [typically] done with codeine & promethazine, ingredients are proven to be harmful to the user, putting them at risk for opioid addiction, cardiac arrest, and neuroleptic malignant syndrome—all of which can lead to death.\n\nMuch like the concept of e-cigs, though, many heads seem unaware that there is a much safer alternative—Legal Lean. It uses a unique blend of natural ingredients and herbal extracts, like chamomile, lavender, and St. John's Wort to help users earn similar relaxing and calming effects that cats have been getting for years sipping from 'foam cups.' Each flavor also contains four B-vitamins; B3, B5, B6, and B12—for added health benefit.\n\nThe popularity of Lean alternatives, especially with younger drinkers who have seen public figures like A$AP Yams pass away in the past few years [and amongst] those in the know—aside from the health risks—also stems from the fact that it's legal. With alternatives that are just as effective as the street-original, why not get up on Legal Lean?\n\nLearn more about <a href=\"http://www.howtomakelean.com\">how to make Legal Lean</a>, here.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WQWjdWkWjg\n\n<i>[note: AAHH does not condone Lean or officially co-sign it's alternatives.]</i>",

His upcoming release Helen Keller is in the works, but to keep fans satisfied, he dropped a super dope rendition of a Wu-Tang classic, \"CREAM,\" alongside a B-Side, \"Can It Be.\" The dope factor--aside from Otis' bars--is the actual instrumentation; these ain't freestyles.

    "content_html": "<blockquote>\"I remember going to the studio with Big Boi, and going there, and meeting him. I was playing some of my music over the AUX and saw him in the back of the room with his eyes closed swaying in the back.\" --Matt Citron</blockquote>\n[dropcap]A[/dropcap]s a city, Atlanta has a certain lane that it has come to inhabit in hip-hop's eco-system; rightfully so, superstars like Gucci and Future, as well as coverage like that on Noisey's Atlanta series, it would be easy to [some degree] pigeon hole their sound. That's part of the reason that an election-day email telling men to check out the next biggest thing from the city was met with a little cynicism. That it, until I pressed play. The artist in question, Matt Citron, has a certain energy about him. His latest single, \"404\" featuring the Yeezy affiliated XXL freshman alumni Cyhi The Prince--and Money Makin' Nique--is getting some crazy traction, but his Facebook reveals some of the madness that will likely come to pass. One example is him spending a week working with Buckwild of the mighty D.I.T.C—or him getting love from artists like Busta And Outkast's Big Boi.\n\nIn general, artists who have this much buzz, they pan out to special—especially when respected taste-makers are giving their seals of approval. I won't make unduly comparisons to past examples, but as a writer it's exciting to catch up with the rapper in the 'calm' before the storm. Check out the interview with Matt below, and see what you've been sleeping on!\n\nEarly!\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zhwpWwsnDJA\n\n<strong> One thing that stuck out is, you had a quote from DJ Greg Street that says you could be one of Atlanta's next top artists. How does a co-sign like that feel?</strong>\n\nI think I met Greg going a little under two years ago now, and when we got introduced to each other, he supported me from the jump. Greg's kind of notoriously known in Atlanta for not wanting to get involved with a lot of rappers early on. Obviously with what he does, he deals with rappers every single day, and deals with different artists every single day, but when he met me, he just took to the music right away. He took to the energy of what I was doing, and the reasons I was doing it. I've been around him a lot where he's talked about how much he believes in what I'm doing, and basically, really just believes in my ability, and my vision.Greg Street, growing up, that was someone that I looked up to, and I admired. I've been having a lot of things happen lately that feel like--over the past couple years really-dreams almost? Not even like dreams, but they don't set in. It's crazy, you know?\n\nHaving someone that big giving that high praise, I always think with the amount of work I put in, and how blessed I've been to be able to do what I can do, I feel as though, do I deserve those words? Yeah, I feel I do, just because of the amount of time I spend on it. But, that doesn't take away from the fact that it's mind blowing to have someone at that level, and that stature, to say that. I obviously have the belief in myself that I can take this as far as I set my mind to, but to have someone at that level confirm it, it's amazing, and it does feel incredible.\n\n<strong>How are you different than a lot of Atlanta artists? Because also, from Greg Street saying you're one of the biggest artists in Atlanta, that's huge because there's such a range of artists that have come out of Atlanta, you know what I mean? And the music from Atlanta has grown so much - I don't want to say the genre has expanded there, but it has a lot of sub genres.</strong>\n\nWell, honestly, I think maybe what makes me stand out in Atlanta is the reason that Atlanta stands out, period. I think that's probably because there are so many different types of artists in Atlanta that aren't afraid to stand out. I think that we kind of break the mold in different ways. You have different artists, even going back all the way to Outkast who broke the mold--Atlanta, back then, it wasn't even rap. Like the booty shake music was big back then, and then Outkast came through with some real lyrics, and they cracked that open. They were doing this vibey, chilled out, super lyrical rapping, and they showed that Atlanta could break the mold. And then time and time again, I think Future invented that style of just the real gutter, muddy singing, and then you have artists like Lil' Yachty who no one's never heard anybody sing like that before, and then people just take influence from Atlanta. But I think really, Atlanta's just not afraid to break the mold. If I've taken anything from the culture, just from observing it in Atlanta --not even really saying like 'taken,' but just really learned from what I've seen - it's that you can do your own thing here.\n\nI think really, that's the artists that make it. I think that the artists that try to copy other artists in Atlanta, they don't cut through in a real way that's going to have any longevity. For me, I just grew up listening to so many different types of music, so many different types of hip hop artists in particular, and so my influences were so broad that I took a lot from that. And also, I have a very large influence from the New York rappers as well, because I spent a couple of years up there, but really, my whole family's from up in New York, so I grew up listening to a lot of the artists like that. But yeah, I think what separates me from a lot of the artists in Atlanta, I think it would be too hard for me to do that. It's like, what separates Migos from Lil' Yachty? What separates Young Jeezy from T.I? There's so much there. And so I think that really, probably what separates me is the same thing that makes me alike. I am different, and I sound different, and I think there's a lot of artists coming out of the city that just don't sound really like anybody else around.<strong>\n</strong>\n\n<hr />\n\n[caption id=\"\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"586\"]<img class=\"\" src=\"https://scontent.fyyz1-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/13315706_1726512874303399_3108945178215151912_n.jpg?oh=576d1b89eb8800169e684b6762b0102f&oe=58F6DBCD\" width=\"586\" height=\"586\" /> Matt with (clockwise) Buckwild, Greg Street, & Diamond D.[/caption]\n\n<hr />\n\n<strong>Over the last few years, things have been picking up for you. What have been some of the milestones?</strong>\n\nWell, I dropped out of school. After I was playing college ball, I hurt my eye and I just didn't want to be up in New York anymore, [so I] decided to come down to Atlanta--back to where I was born and raised. I spent a lot of time by myself, just working. I looked up to Greg Street, and me and him had a close relationship, we spent a lot of time just talking, and doing different things, recording different stuff, and I just spent a lot of time doing some self reflecting. I think I really got to know myself for that first year, and then after that, finally I dropped the song. It was originally called \"Exhibit C,\" which is now call \"Tabasco Flows.\" I put that out, which is basically just me rapping over Jay Electronica's \"Exhibit C\" beat, and I remember the first night I put it out, DJ Khaled retweeted it, and that was crazy. After that, I took a little bit of time off, and I actually got linked up with Brooklyn Nights; I'm working with them now, and they introduced me to a bunch of guys. I went up to New York, and I was in the studio with Busta Rhymes, and Jim Jones. That was crazy, because those are two of my biggest influences I've ever listened to.\n\nSo, I was in the studio with them, and the fact that they listened to my music, but they didn't just listen to it, like they really fucked with it...I think each artist kind of has their own growth, and it's all individual. I think just the way that it's been happening for me. I've met Sway, I did Sway in the Morning when he was down here in Atlanta for BET, and he really fucked with me. So I just felt like there are people in the industry that are so well respected, and the way I'm coming up with things, it doesn't feel like a lot of other artists have been this blessed this early on with what they're doing, but it doesn't feel forced, it doesn't feel contrived. These people don't fuck with me because it's like 'Oh, this kid's going to make us some money.' Nah, it's been 'We respect what you're doing, we love how you're making music.' It's hip hop, it's real, it's raw, it's what I'm doing, and so they've taken to it. Moments like that, like when I was in the studio with Busta Rhymes, we actually went out after that, and just being out, just off the sheer strength that he just fucked with my music. Things like that. Then putting out songs and having it get played on Beats One with Ebro. It's just little things.\n\nIt's just little things, and none of them, the Busta Rhymes and Jim Jones shit was fucking unreal, but none of them hits you crazy hard, especially with me, I'm the type of person I just like to keep my head down and keep pushing. But with that, it's just these little things where I sit back for a second and be like, holy fucking shit; these are the people that I've looked up to for years, and that I've only seen on TV, and in videos, and over the tracks. I remember going to the studio with Big Boi, and going there, and meeting him. I was playing some of my music over the AUX and saw him in the back of the room with his eyes closed swaying in the back; it's just little moments like that where you feel so blessed, and you also just feel proud of yourself that you worked hard. A lot of these songs, you work on them alone in your room, or just in the studio, just you and your engineer, and then you just don't even realize the places they can take you, or the people they can put you in front of. It's definitely been some very unbelievable moments, but it's also just been a positive past year/year and a half of people just really showing me love, and supporting, and being involved with what I'm doing.\n\n<strong>So what's next then? You mentioned you're in the studio with Jim, you're in the studio with Busta, you're in the studio with Big Boy, so is there like a super monster project we should be looking out for?\n</strong>\nYeah, I mean really that was kind of vibing out, and then listening to what I was doing. I remember sitting down with Busta and him telling me 'We're gonna get on a track together, we're gonna do it,' and I remember what he said, he was like 'I'm gonna murder you on it.' Then he kind of laughed and looked around, then got quiet, got in close and said, 'I'm really just saying that because I want you to murder me on the track.' So just to feel the level of competition there - but right now, I think everyone's just enjoying watching what's going on, and I don't even feel like I'm at the place where I want to - I mean obviously, I want to make music with guys like that, but I feel like I'm in the position where I need to prove myself more than that at this point. Right now, I'm making music, I've got a tape coming in December that I'm going to be putting out, it's called <em>Final Moments of Forever</em>, and really on this tape, I just want it to be an introduction to what I'm doing. It does deal with a lot of personal things in my life, and there's also just a lot to prove. I feel like I have a lot that I have to show out.\n\nIf I'm going to be regarding myself as one of the best lyricists, if not the best lyricist in my opinion, then I can't come out of the gate with anything but really fucking crazy shit. If I'm going to have other people supporting me, and hitting me up, and sending me messages saying 'You're like the dopest rapper I've found in a long time,' I've got to step up to the plate, and I've got to hit home runs. So I feel like right now, it's just a point of stepping up to the plate and proving myself, and I'm still working on music nonstop. I'm just making it clear that I'm not interested in just being another guy in the mix. I'm here to compete. I grew up playing basketball, and I've always played that at a very high competitive level, obviously playing in college, and I don't like buddy-buddy stuff.\n\nI love the positive vibes, and meeting other artists, and vibing out with them, but it's kind of like when I used to play ball. If we were boys, we played on the same travel team--we might even go out, get some food together, play some video games together, whatever. But when it comes time to play against each other, you're ripping heads off, and you're trying to come at that guy's neck, and you're trying to win that game. When the game's over, you laugh about it, and you shake hands, and you talk shit if you want, and you take the shit if you lost. But right now I'm kind of in the mindset where I want to come in and make some noise, and I think there's no better way to do that than put my head down and try to do the best work I possibly can. So regarding what's next, this project coming up, I probably got one more track coming out before then that's going to be on the tape, but other than that, the tape's coming, and then I got a whole mess of shit coming after that. I've got a lot of shit in the chamber that I'm working on. I don't really see any point or sign of slowing with what I've got going. I'm hungrier than I've ever been, and I wake up each day, and the hunger keeps growing, so I'm feeling it right now.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRJuB3c6J2E",

    "content_html": "<blockquote>\"I wanted to make something for when I was having a shitty day—something to play to make me feel good.\" --Isaiah Rashad, Pigeons & Planes</blockquote>\n[dropcap]T[/dropcap]DE has a way of making us fiend for shit--a few examples being SZA, AB-Soul, and Isaiah Rashad. The artists themselves, with the exception of Isaiah, have openly voiced frustration with the label for seemingly holding them back from dropping what they described as finished products--leaving some fans to wonder if they`d be benched, not unlike some artists in Wu-Tang who had to simply wait for their turns. For young Isaiah, that wasn`t necessarily the case; his lapse in musical output was simply him not focusing on the task at hand. In fact, during his press run for the new album, he openly admitted he was addicted to pills and alcohol, and battled with depression, anxiety, and isolation during his apparent \"downtime.\" Also, without elaborating, he noted that he was almost dropped three times during the process of putting the project together--likely stemming from his issues with the vices above.\n\nThe rapper, who signed to Kendrick Lamar`s home base released his Civilia project to an internet public that couldn`t get enough. Amidst touring with Schoolboy Q for the entirely of his debut album promo run and being honored as part of the 2014 XXL Freshman Class, he kept fans on the hook for an official debut that seemed all but unlikely. That was, until this past August.\n\nTrue to their word, the label gave us appetizers, \"Free Lunch,\" on top of two earlier released non-album singles, \"Nelly\" and \"Smile.\" This was followed by an official release of <em>The Sun's Tirade</em>, on September 6th. The album peaked at number four on the Billboard US/R&B and was embraced by critics. Our own <a href=\"http://aboveaveragehiphop.com/isaiah-rashad-the-suns-tirade/\">Ernst Constant</a> called the album \"the right soundtrack for the end of summer, and the beginning of fall, as the tracks slide from sizzling hot energy to a cooled down tempo.\"\n\nIsaiah's time is now. This New Year, he's hitting the road for a 22+ date tour across the country in 2017; it kicks off in Lawrence, Kansas on January 18th, and touches down in several big cities including Chicago, New York, Boston, Detroit, DC, Philly, Miami and Nashville. <a href=\"https://gooddeedseats.com/isaiah-rashad-tickets/\">Tickets for The Lil' Sunny Tour</a>, which also features Jay IDK and fellow TDE signee Lance Skiiiwalker, whose <em>Introverted Intuition</em> album dropped this past October, are currently available on <a href=\"https://gooddeedseats.com/learn-more-donate/\">Good Deed Seats</a>; why should you use Good Deed Seats? Well, $5 from every ticket sale is donated to a partner charity. So, you get to catch an incredible show while making a difference.\n\nDon't miss the tour that XXL Magazine named as one of their <a href=\"http://www.xxlmag.com/news/2016/11/hip-hop-tours-in-winter/\">must-see winter tours</a>!\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTJNaR_hPXQ",

    "content_html": "<blockquote>\"I am a wizard, an illusionist. I am a dreamer in a dream without a society. I am Hodgy.\"\n--Hodgy</blockquote>\n[dropcap]O[/dropcap]dd Future--although dope--always felt a little too young for me. I entered high school in 96-97, so while they were a breath of fresh air and a middle finger to the polished more business-oriented major releases running the day, I never fully 'committed' to them. Because, while I loved and recognized their obvious significance, it felt a little too immature, for lack of a better term. My initial instincts about their importance was obviously correct, no need to bore you. But, like [most] groups of youngsters who blow fast [pause] and go zero to a hundred real quick, they experienced understandable turmoil, and eventually--via the Twitter fingers of Tyler The Creator--the group was officially disbanded.\n\nBut, for one-time member Hodgy Beats, who now simply goes by Hodgy, it's a new day. With the experience behind him, and a wealth of opportunity ahead of him, Hodgy is finally stepping out on his own with his official debut, <em>Fireplace: The NotTheOtherSide</em>; it's a stark departure from everything you think you know about him as an artist and person. Framed around a conversation with his [insanely insightful] mother, the project is the 26-year-old's coming of age, in a way, exploring themes that range from forgiveness to mortality, co-parenting and more. He seems woke, shedding his past, and soaring towards new skies. No shock value, no antics, just bars, surprisingly amazing production, and only three features—so, he's basically out on the ledge himself. \n\nThe first single/video \"Barbel\" is a renaissance track that asserts his hunger and his focus, while the 88-Keys produced \"<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctkJPjrLm4U\">Final Hour</a>\" and BADBADNOTGOOD produced \"<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aTiNzSiq37U\">Tape Beat</a>\" sees the young rapper holding his own alongside superstars Busta Rhymes and Lil' Wayne, respectively. Holding his own is an understatement—even without the star power, this project holds up.\n\nHighlights for me were \"<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gn-TQi0De-o\">Resurrection</a>,\" which is a concept built upon a one-way conversation with God, and the jazzy relationship-themed record \"<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3oWoZifR7U\">Turkuoise</a>,\" which has been playing back in my head for days. Full disclosure, I've been playing this album on repeat for the last week.\n\nThis album seemed very personal at points—as though he alot to get off of his chest. It's a strong first 'solo' effort, and does a great deal to really re-brand Hodgy as his own rapper, outside of the OF shadow. It's only the beginning, though. I heard through the grapevine that he has a collaborative album in the works with Nelly Furtado, amongst other things. He's still incredibly young; chances are, we'll be seeing a lot more of Hodgy in the years to come.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZb2Gw01tp4\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3oWoZifR7U",

I would say that I am versatile, as I have club bangers, trap music, freestyles, and emotional songs.\n\n<b>What made you want to rap?</b>\n\nI've always had a passion for music—ever since I could remember. I never really thought I enjoyed it to an extent where I thought I would be making it, though. It wasn't until a couple of weeks ago when I started writing music and getting feedback from my fans that I realized I wanted to do this for the rest of my life.\n\n<b>Who or what are your major influences?</b>\n\nI think the only influence that I have is seeing people play [my] music and enjoy it.\n\n<b>What have you dropped so far?</b>\n\nI have released four songs so far: \"Bout It, No Fake Friends, It's Okay,\" and \"Bust It Open.\" I am currently working on a track with Drebo [\"Squeezed Up\" was his biggest hit], a Palm Beach native, that will be released towards the end of this month. Also, I am working on my debut mixtape: Panties, Bologna, and Cheese: Part 1. [*laughs] I came up with the title randomly, I swear; but, it will be released in January.\n\n<b>What are your goals? What are younhooing to achieve?</b>\n\nHaving only just started rapping, I think it's amazing that people like my music and not to mention my music videos—shout out to my cameraman Brian Mafuz (YMDMP). Overall, my goals in the industry are just to be able to make a living off rapping and being able to live comfortable. That includes taking care of my family and my friends.\n\n<b>Where do you go from here?</b>\n\nThe next step for me is just to get my name out in the industry as much as possible—and as fast as possible. Once I blow up, everything will be easy from there in my opinion.",

Indeed, created throughout the course of roughly 15 months, it transcends the standard producer/emcee project with the two truly taking the time to understand the nuances of their respective roles, and melding it into a project. It was shaped by a series of collective life experiences including [but not limited to] Breakups with girlfriends, national politics, local politics, etc. Nick, for example, was going through a bitter custody battle at the beginning of the process, which he won near the projects halfway mark, which dramatically shifted his state of mind and tone.\n\n\"The record puts you on a rollercoaster,\" Nick describes, \"one second you're laughing, and by the last track, you will have tears in your eyes.\"\nThe project is available now at <a href=\"https://nomadhiphop.bandcamp.com/album/how-to-ruin-everything\">Nomadhiphop.bandcamp.com</a>.\n\n<iframe style=\"border: 0; width: 620px; height: 472px;\" src=\"https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=1328942973/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/artwork=small/transparent=true/\" width=\"300\" height=\"150\" seamless=\"\"><a href=\"http://nomadhiphop.bandcamp.com/album/how-to-ruin-everything\">How to Ruin Everything by Nomad Hip Hop and DJ DN3</a></iframe>",

    "content_html": "[dropcap]T[/dropcap]wo particular lines stood out to me as I listened to the latest record from Charles Hamilton. On the first track, he confidently and coyly harps, \"I had a hot start; label tried to make me a pop star—they wanted an album, and I made art.\" Second, a few songs later, he pleads, \"don't laugh at my sadness...I'm predisposed to it.\" This artistry and obvious emotional instability perfectly sum up the [almost] enigma that is Charles Hamilton, the Harlem-world resident who after heaps of promise and notoriety finally released his self-titled major label debut this month (via Republic). With a few exceptions, the project is densely packed with substance, personality, and a gambit of themes that range from race in America ( on \"Correct\"), depression, his own (very public) demons, and more.\n\nCharles, who likely holds a record with two debut albums shelved (although leaked), did a lot to distinguish himself on this project, which is something new fans will be able to appreciate, as it gives an entry point to this complicated emcee. He opens up about everything, from his struggles overcoming depression and isolation to the incident where he punched a cop. On the less-reflective and more savage outro, \"Stay There,\" he acknowledges some of his more controversial criticisms. Namely, his ill-fated attempt to help Dilla's mother out by crediting him as executive producer of his shelved project and his viral spat with Ex-girlfriend, Briana.\n\nSome of the highlights I found were \"Only Christina Knows,\" a heartbreaking ode to the woman that he described as keeping him alive and making his life complete, and the piano-driven \"Man's World.\" I didn't care for \"Be With You\" it seemed uninspired and out of place to me.\n\nHaving done some—obviously reparable—damage to his career while reeling from addiction and undiagnosed bipolar disorder, it was exciting to see him picking up steam (again) with his Rita Ora-assisted \"New York Raining\" which appeared on \"Empire.\" Coming into the fold during the bubble of time where Cudi and Lupe were starting to make names for themselves, Charles is a true artist—this music is clearly more therapeutic than anything. His overly clear enunciated bars, which may put some newer fans in mind of Odd Future's Sweatshirt Earl, are heavy as hell—worth a place on your playlist if you're into music that has some heart and soul to it.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cp8iSZqnGhk\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzT8HuLe1zw",

If you're not up on them yet—now's a good time to add them to your playlists.\n\nDon't sleep!\n\n<hr>\n\n<b>Aaron Cohen</b>\n\nhttps://youtu.be/svMHck2MzHg\n\nHe has been bubbling in circles for a minute, but the Seattle-native popped onto my radar with his 2015 release <i>Homeless</i>. His latest release, <i>Off The Ground</i> has been his biggest to date, premiering on XXL and spawning overseas tour dates. After hearing what he has in the stash via a Facebook Live session, and with a Paris festival already booked for 2017, the New Year is about to be kind to him!\n\n<a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/aaron-cohen\">Soundcloud</a>\n<a href=\"https://exit.sc/?url=http%3A%2F%2Ffacebook.com%2Faaroncohenmusic\">Facebook</a>\n<a href=\"https://exit.sc/?url=http%3A%2F%2Faaroncohenmusic.com%2F\">Website</a>\n\n<hr>\n\n<b>Intelligenz</b>\n\nhttps://youtu.be/Dv1kd89A7Jk\n\nSmart, pretty, articulate, and blessed with the soul of a real emcee, Intelligenz has had a great year. I had a great interview—which was more of a casual hip-hop convo—earlier this summer. She rounded off a year of buzz-worthy stage shows with a European tour supporting Slick Rick The Ruler, even premiering her latest single in France, where she opened for Red, Meth, and De La Soul. Oh, and she's signed to HipNott [Kevin Nottingham's label]; no big deal.\n\n<a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/iamintelligenz\">Soundcloud</a>\nFacebook\n<a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/iamintelligenz\">Website</a>\n\n<hr>\n\n<b>Matt Citron</b>\n\nhttps://youtu.be/zhwpWwsnDJA\n\nI get an intimidating amount of artist submissions, but something about Matt Citron resonated with me. Maybe it was the legendary DJ Greg Street calling him the next hottest thing out of Atlanta. Maybe it was the overall dopeness of his single \"404\" that features Cyhi The Prince. Perhaps it's his undeniable industry buzz and his as if yet unreleased work with D.I.T.C's Buckwild; whatever it is, this kid is going to pop, and the excitement radiating from his circle is infectious.\n\n<a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/mattcitronmtz\">Soundcloud</a>\n<a href=\"https://exit.sc/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fmattcitronmtz\">Facebook</a>\n\n<hr>\n\n<b>NXUS</b>\n\nhttps://youtu.be/T3Ge31MO3EA\n\n22-year-old NXUS, who is one-third of the trio known as Dead Reputation (with Delirious Beats [producer/engineer] and Rake [writer/videographer/film editor/photographer]), continues to impress me. I was a huge fan of their last collective release, “Rake Cat,” and his latest record “Holy wATEr” is just crack. I get the vibe from NXUS; he has something about him–you can just feel that he’s headed along the right incline. A hidden gem, for sure.\n\n<a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/nastynxus\">Soundcloud</a>\n<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/nastynxus/\">Facebook</a>\n<a href=\"https://nastynxus.bandcamp.com/\">Website</a>\n\n<hr>\n\n<b>Track Seven Band</b>\n\nhttps://youtu.be/GgxpfGwpC5U\n\nBack in 2011, Bronx rapper, Cost, was looking for a band to back him for live performances. What he found is what we now, five years later, know as the Track Seven Band. Their EP, <i>The Try And The Fail</i>, was one of the better projects I reviewed this year. It's as hip-hop as you can get, and at points deeply personal, but packaged with an unmistakable crossover appeal.

    "content_html": "[dropcap]I[/dropcap]t's funny what looking past the surface can tell you about an artist--and provide regarding meaningful content. In this case, Philly rapper ToNe Wiley's latest EP, <em>The Lazarus</em>, is an enjoyable listen. Baked within a hearty contemporary sound that, lyrics withstanding, could prop up any artist coming from the cities current fabric, are themes of faith, hope, despair, and redemption. The title itself is a reference to a biblical story about Saint Lazarus, whom Jesus resurrected from death as a sign of the overarching power that faith in him delivered. The name in modern culture/society is used to reference a magnitude of 'resurrections.'\n\nThe first two songs on the project seem to take a literal approach to the theme; albeit, without getting into the specifics that may give a clearer picture of the artist. \"Takeover,\" comes off as a 'back and on a mission' proclamation, without getting too into the weeds about where he's gone, although \"Testimony\" suggests that perhaps the streets of Philadelphia may have led to a life change. Regardless, the first two records seem to assert an underlying overtone of religious faith and cautious optimism that seems to carry this artist along as he navigates the dangers of one of America's most notorious cities. A few more clues to his character are scattered throughout the remaining records. On \"Reign,\" for example, he separates himself from any association with street life, noting that he's not \"a thug,\" and stating defiantly, \"homie you ain't cool 'cuz you sell drugs, nigga.\" Under this particular scope, \"Superfly Jones\" and \"Westside Story\" feel like great examples of storytelling and third party observation rather than first-hand experience--although, that may not be accurate.\n\nHis dramatic--and heart wrenching--take on his cities murder rate are explored on \"What Are We Doing,\" which I consider to be a real highlight on this project. It feels as though it could be the soundtrack for a mini-film or documentary.\n\nCloaked in shadowy imagery--and really amazing production--<em>The Lazarus</em> is a gem. Worth a spot on your playlist this week.\n\n<iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/playlists/281862333&color=ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false\" width=\"100%\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"no\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe>",

Case and point, The MC i, who recently popped up on the scene with his record \"Kno Dats Me.\" Dripping in \"Bacardi Slang,\" the single--and high quality [crew assisted] video--give an exciting look at what the artist has to offer. With a style sensibility that more leans towards a gentlemanly vibe of someone like Jidenna rather than a more street rapper, his sing-songy flows and distinctive look are intriguing. With a night time vibe, and little biographical content out there [he's new], he has a mystique that currently exists. I can't put my finger on whether he's a street rapper or not--but his lyrical content suggests he's not a cat to take lightly.\n\nAt the end of the day--I know nothing about this kid, but I'm feeling this first impression enough to keep it locked. Give the video a look for yourself--and if you feel the same let me know; better yet, mash the share button.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KbIcUA9HCG8",

    "content_html": "[dropcap]I[/dropcap]t's my last spotlight of 2016, and I'm ending with an exciting new artist I came across. Washington, D.C., born LA resident, Mizzark, does it all: writes, produces, raps and sings. Coming back into the spotlight after a [self-imposed] two-year hiatus, he's back with a deep new record that where he discusses--amongst things--the loss of his mother back in 2013. \"FOE (demo)\" sits at almost seven minutes, and is packed with bars that clearly defines his allegiance to his grind and his team; \"Gotta take care of the fam before I take care of myself--gotta take care of the fam, fuck everybody else.\"\n\nMizzark is heavily influenced by screwed up music, as popularized by the iconic DJ Screw; in fact, he's created his personalized version of the movement called Purp'd--you can hear this effect at the end of his new record. \"Listening to any of my purp'd tracks you'll notice it's a lot slower than your normal chopped and screwed,\" he says about the technique, \"and it has a couple of beat pattern changes and other effects as well throughout the songs.\"\n\nSkater. Musician. Photographer. Videographer. Artist. Mizzark likens himself as a creative soul, and his records have more than enough elements to make them stand out from the pack--especially his record \"Jungle,\" a slow R&B record I found on his SoundCloud. Check out his music below, and if you're feeling it, then knock on the share button.\n\n<iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https://api.soundcloud.com/tracks/208883260&color=ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false\" width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" frameborder=\"no\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe>\n\n<iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https://api.soundcloud.com/tracks/297353312&color=ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false\" width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" frameborder=\"no\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe>",

He had a slightly different delivery—of course. Well, after playing the latest Matt Citron project through a few times, I guess I can understand why some passing by asked me what Drake record that was. His cadence is quite similar, but his content is anything but sweet. <em>Final Moments Of Forever</em> is a lot [of things] at once. It's a bar for bar platter of ATL hip-hop with an east coast aesthetic and a precedence for new rappers [skill and quality wise]p; it's an audio portrait of an artist with an obsession and dedication to both this music game and his dreams.\n\nMatt sets himself up as a lyricist off the bat over the boom-bap-ish drum loop of \"Save My Soul,\" before taking it to early 2000 vibe on the ultra-jazzy \"One Time.\" He gives a commentary on the perceptions about him—and on the severe lack of differentiation between [today's] artists—on \"Never Worried.\" It probably stands as the most contemporary sounding record on the album; \"who were you before you were you; all these new rappers who is who,\" he laments, reflecting on the sea of similarity.\n\nWhile \"Stay Down\" talks about his dedication to his grind—which has paid off—\"All That I Need\" and the outro of the record \"Shallow Waters\" seem to suggest the role that his grind has had on his relationships. The music life is a mistress after all, especially when your artist with as much buzz on Matt. The latter record also delves into his past, with the chorus reflecting on how much he's [personally] grown and overcome over the years on his road to the position he's sitting in today.\n\nThe record also has more radio-friendly moments, like the Cyhi The Prince-assisted \"404,\" and \"Dancing Bones,\" with a sing-song hook and an overall vibe that reminds me of Anderson Paak and Mac Miller's \"Dang!\"\n\nLook, getting major artists to be on your records, and appear in your videos, is [in most cases] more of an outward display of wealth and connection for unknown artists. A few emails to a manager and some money exchanged; anything is possible. Having iconic artists vibe with you in the studio, though, requires a certain level of mutual respect that is priceless. Not only does Matt humbly lay claim to such relationships, but he gracefully chose to release a record that fails to exploit them. The fact that Big Boi, Busta, and producers like Buckwild co-sign him may get you through the door, but the cohesiveness, meticulous quality, depth and the overall experience of <em>Final Moments Of Forever</em> are what prompt you to make yourself at home. If you don't know, now you know—ninja.\n\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"450\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/playlists/283786583&color=ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false\"></iframe>",

    "content_html": "[dropcap]I[/dropcap] get a lot of artists that submit content here at AAHH; I'll shamelessly admit to a few things I often use to initially judge rappers: their artwork and their co-signs. These can help me to sort through artists who are next up, and artists who have some machine—or angel-connection—behind them. Vin-O is one such artist, sort of. I'll admit his artwork kind of through me off initially, as did the title of his project; BUT, a cruise through his Facebook revealed that he had been working with Chuckie Thompson. For those in the dark, he's one of the producers in Puffy's infamous in-house team. His credits are intense, but \"Big Poppa,\" Craig Mack's iconic \"Flava In Ya Ear,\" and Biggie's posthumous hit \"Dead Wrong\" are among them. Naturally, I shrugged and pushed play.\n\n<i>Death Of A Poet, Birth Of A Gamesta</i> is a thirteen-song project that has some of the same characteristics that a [traditional] bride looks for on her wedding day: something new and something borrowed. The album boasts a wealth of truly impressive production value, although much of it feels familiar in a sea of similar production. Not necessarily a bad thing—the project is current and can easily slot into most 2016 playlists with ease. Lyrically Vin-o seems like an old head; off the rip, he asserts the street shit that gleams through the cracks in the fancy new gentrified city of Washington DC. Through the album's cuts like \"Wintaz In DC\" and \"Bizness As Usual,\" we hear tales from a DC-native that has seen some of the more insidious sights the nation's capital has to offer residents in it's rougher areas.\n\nI felt his personality come alive—more so—on records like \"Untold Tales.\" That record specifically was packed with an equal balance of wordplay and autobiographical context; \"An 80s baby still a baby in the crazy 80s, dead bodies had my neighborhood pushing daisies.\" It's when he focuses on first-hand tales of perseverance and social injustice, like on the record \"G.O.D.\" that you get him. Those aforementioned records had a different tempo/feel, as well. That actually resulted in a slightly different style that really suits him.\n\nHis music is quality—plain and simple. His vocals are crispy, and his cadence is unique. He's worth a few listens—check out the album below and then explore his catalog.\n\n<iframe style=\"border: 0; width: 100%; height: 472px;\" src=\"http://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=1716374952/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/artwork=small/transparent=true/\" seamless=\"\">&lt;a href=\"http://music.denarddapoet.com/album/death-of-a-poet-brth-of-a-gmesta\"&gt;Death Of A Poet / Brth Of A Gmesta by Vin-O (formerly Denard Dapoet)&lt;/a&gt;</iframe>",

    "content_html": "[dropcap]I[/dropcap]t's unfortunate that because 90s hip-hop predated the internet and technology in its current iteration, it is so under-documented. Much of the most amazing (verbally) recounted experiences in the timeline of hip-hop weren't captured. That's what was so exciting about Stretch And Bobbito's documentary film, \"Radio That Changed Life.\" Universally hailed as the greatest hip-hop radio show ever, the duo's show played host to many of the most memorable pre-stardom freestyles and moments of some of hip-hop's biggest icons. Initially only able seen at private screenings across the nation—and in Toronto—it's now available for your next Netflix and chill session.'\n\nWhat initially begins as a quasi-linear story of how the duo met, and how the show came to be, morphs into a [feel-filled] journey through the highs and lows of a show whose climax and ultimate end paralleled (arguably) the era most of us older heads hold dear in our hearts. The best moments came from watching the faces of the various artists as Stretch and Bob played them their classic freestyles on a Walkman. There were many glossy eyes—it was an oddly emotional experience. The show's end, from Stretch's perspective, came from his dissolution with the state of music industry, and his inability to program entire episodes full of music he truly loved; the byproduct was a domino effect.\n\n\"Wouldn't you like to just go back, just to see it,\" asked a seemingly emotional Nas? That—to me—was the sentiment that most of us felt watching this incredible documentary. An excellent window into an era long gone, and a reminder of how many people were affected by not only this iconic show but hip-hop as a culture.\n\nLucky you, it's on Netflix; a must watch for curious young heads and anyone who considers themselves keeping it real.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/7e9NhvTfEXg",

    "content_html": "[dropcap]2[/dropcap]016 has been a crazy year for music; and, with a gross political divide and draining presidential campaign in the US, it was much appreciated. There were lots of huge projects this year, and an almost daunting amount of content that passed across my desk over the last 365, but I managed to narrow it down to the top 10 albums that graced my headphones. Honourable mention to J Cole's <em>4 Your Eyez Only</em>, which more than lived up to the hype.\n\nIf you didn't give these albums a fair shake, fire up Apple Music and press play!\n\n<hr />\n\n<strong>Meek Mill — <em>DC4</em></strong>\n\nDC4 has crazy production, a-game contributions from the likes of Quavo, Thugger, Pusha T, and the late Lil’ Snupe — along with French Montana — on the mixtape Outro. If you didn’t like Milly before, you probably wouldn’t like him now, but I’m not sure he cares. For those who either have been fans for a minute or are impartial in all the alienating and distracting non-music nonsense, DC4Life is a dope listen. <a href=\"http://aboveaveragehiphop.com/dc4-is-flames/\">Check out my full review here</a>.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/eHTa826qRLg\n\n<hr />\n\n<strong>ScHool Boy Q — <em>Blank Face</em></strong>\n\nQ is the product of the California sun-kissed, gang-ridden streets — and that always comes across in his music. But he’s also made it out and is in a position where he’s making serious cash alongside the biggest crew in the game. He’s making [his] world a better place for his daughter to grow up in. <em>Blank Face</em> is a lot of the same old ScHoolboy you’ve come to love — but with a dose of newfound retrospective [know better do better] sentiment in the mix. All in all, he’s made his growth apparent; It’s an excellent sequel to a noteworthy debut. <a href=\"http://aboveaveragehiphop.com/schoolboy-q-blank-face-lp-review/\">Check out my full review here</a>.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/YSb6-ppf7fw\n\n<hr />\n\n<strong>Smoke DZA & Pete Rock — <em>Don't Smoke Rock</em></strong>\n\nI was made privy to the existence of this Smoke DZA and Pete Rock collabo while it was still in it's early phases—and was highly anticipating an incredible record. It didn't disappoint; it was a Pete Rock sounding as hungry as he did while making <em>Petestrumentals</em>, and Smoke DZA achieving super-seyan. It's full blown NYC hip-hop at it's finest, with an exciting cast of supporting characters. <a href=\"http://aboveaveragehiphop.com/dont-smoke-rock-is-crack-pun-intended/\">Check out my full review here</a>.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/W900MEGJ46U\n\n<hr />\n\n<strong>A$AP Ferg — <em>Always Strive & Prosper</em></strong>\n\nI was a Ferg fan from the jump. Records like \"Shabba Ranks,\" \"Work,\" and \"Dump Dump\" were iTunes mainstays for me; but his new record, Always Strive & Prosper did more to open him up as an artist in my opinion. After three solid listens to the 18 song effort, I felt as though I was more into Ferg as a person; he gave listeners a chance to get to understand him a bit more clearly. From an ode to his block and professions of love to dealing with the loss of Yams—the record had a little of everything. <a href=\"http://aboveaveragehiphop.com/aap-ferg-always-strive-prosper/\">Check out my full review here</a>.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/EALP0qmx9hc\n\n<hr />\n\n<strong>Hodgy — <em>Fireplace:TheNotTheOtherSide</em></strong>\n\nHardcore fans were saddened to watch as their beloved Odd Future crumbled before their eyes—the nail in the coffin being the public fallout of Tyler and Hodgy Beats. Hodgy—who dropped the 'beats'—decided to step out on his own, and the results were surprisingly dope. I walked the line with the OF catalog, but this album was focused, mature, and a fantastic debut for the (still) young emcee. Rumor has it he's working on a collabo with Nelly Furtado next.<a href=\"http://aboveaveragehiphop.com/a-new-day-hodgy-steps-out-with-his-solo-debut/\"> Check out my full review here</a>.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/TZb2Gw01tp4\n\n<hr />\n\n<strong>Kanye — <em>The Life of Pablo</em></strong>\n\nKanye has had a roller coaster year, no matter how you slice it; however, he still managed to channel his \"genius\" into the highly anticipated <em>TLOP</em>. Conceptually—as a top to bottom listen—it's amazing. Love or hate Yeezy, his strength (from a listener's perspective) is his OCD-level of meticulousness when sequencing his albums. This has an oddly 'rough' feeling to it, which is hard to explain, but it adds charm. Whether or not you were thrown off by his last album, which was quite polarizing [TBH], this was Kanye returning to a more palatable level of dopeness.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/IxGvm6btP1A\n\n<hr />\n\n<strong>ATCQ — We Got It From Here...Thank You 4 Your Service</strong>\n\nI'll be honest and admit that I was also privy to the fact that Tribe was working on an album long before it was announced. I was sworn to secrecy—and my 'mole' will remain nameless. 18 years later, and this album was everything we wanted it to be. After a tough week for those of us who had to watch (with heavy hearts) as Trump—for lack of a better term—\"trumped\" the election, this album helped to make the monumental week a little brighter. I'd be Denise not to mention that I was in my feelings listening to this album. It will stand as a final effort from the original iteration of the group, and a monument to hip-hop culture. RIP Phife. <a href=\"http://aboveaveragehiphop.com/atcq-drop-their-long-awaited-final-album-and-its-wonderful/\">Check out my full review here</a>.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/vO2Su3erRIA\n\n<hr />\n\n<strong>SnowGoons — <em>Goon Bap</em></strong>\n\nThere aren't many albums like Goon Bap these days. If you have an affinity towards 90s hip-hop and you haven't yet taken in this CD yet, you're missing out—in a major way. The production is timeless, and the curated guest list does a remarkable job of bringing together legends like the late Pumpkinhead and younger acts, like Pun's son Chris Rivers, to create a cohesive top to bottom boom-bap smorgasbord with few loose ends. Also, \"The 90s Are Back\" features Psycho Les, Dres, Sticky Fingaz, Nine, Ras Kass, and more on one record—epic is an understatement.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/-v6zo2txSPQ\n\n<hr />\n\n<strong>The Avalanches — <em>Wildflower</em></strong>\n\nTo understand the work that went into this album is to know the love and care that the group puts into their craft. Recorded over the period 16 years, amongst illness, [inner] comings and goings, sample clearance issues, and a lack of rumors, the album is a masterpiece, and one of the finest examples of plunderphonics you’re likely to find. If you’re a fan of producers like J.Rocc, you need to get up on this album — immediately. <a href=\"http://aboveaveragehiphop.com/danny-brown-mf-doom-and-more-guest-on-the-avalanches-wildflower/\">Read my full review here</a>.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/eu0KsZ_MVBc\n\n<hr />\n\n<strong>De La Soul — And The Anonymous Nobody...</strong>\n\nAlthough they haven’t released an official album since 2004’s The Grind Date, it’s unfair to say De La Soul weren’t active for the past 12 years. They were festival mainstays performing for excited fans who had come into their own along with the group through the early 1990s. They didn’t feel pressure to make new material and the Anonymous Nobody… is organic in the best way possible. It came about from both sheer crowd-sourced demand and the trio’s undying love of the art itself. Nothing here is rushed, forced or out of place. The album doesn’t try to fit into any box for the purpose of selling records. Hell, the records were pre-sold, so stakes weren’t that high. But they still put together one of their strongest efforts yet. <a href=\"http://www.xxlmag.com/news/2016/08/de-la-soul-make-a-strong-return-with-and-the-anonymous-nobody/\">Check my full review for XXL magazine</a>.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/pFTNjzzeU-8",

    "content_html": "[dropcap]H[/dropcap]oly s--t! 2016 was a crazy year; I feel like we've all been through a lot together. There's been this crazy US election that's seemingly brought out the ugly in many, created more uncertainty than comfort and effectively divided a nation. We also took some huge losses, like Phife Dawg from A Tribe Called Quest, who had been battling with diabetes and kidney failure for years, and iconic singer Prince. There was also Shawty Lo, who died in a car accident; or course, that's sadly just the tip of the iceberg. However, as a writer, I've been happy to take in lots of amazing music this year. It's been a great year for the culture. Sadat X's Agua, Pete Rock and Smoke Dza's Don't Smoke Rock, ScHool Boy Q's Blankface, and—obviously—Tribe's bitter-sweet final album, all gave me a great listening moments that I was happy to share with my readers. I'm talking both here at AAHH, and with my followers who read my work on XXL Magazine's site.\n\nI also have to give a special shout out to my team; AAHH had a great year. With superstars like Wyclef, Skyzoo, Atmosphere (and countless others) gracing the site, our internship program, and all of the great indie discoveries we've made, I couldn't be happier or prouder of the tremendous growth we've had in 2016. I can say with absolute certainty that the upcoming year will be just as big—fuck it, BIGGER.\n\nBless up to all of our lovely readers for riding with us; we'll keep bringing that realness. What I've put together here is—at its core—a collection of my personal writing for AAHH. It's the most memorable moments and finds of my 365. My fave interviews, my top six upcoming acts, some of my newest reviews, and a few features I was humbled to write. So sit back relax, and enjoy my [personal] 2016 roundup.\n\n<iframe style=\"width:100%; height:679px;\" src=\"//e.issuu.com/embed.html#17861226/42076869\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe>",

    "content_html": "<blockquote>\"Bottoms up sunshine, Love Potion No. 9.\"--Geechi Suede (Camp-Lo)</blockquote>\n[dropcap]W[/dropcap]ell, the 28th of January marks The twentieth anniversary of one of my favorite albums ever, Camp Lo's Uptown Saturday Night. I remember copping it with my homeboy back in the ninth grade and being hooked on it immediately. Led by the infectious horn-heavy single \"Luchini,\" the album did something lots of records are unable to do: infuse jazz and hip-hop in an accessible way.\n\nLet's explore that for a second, what does that mean, exactly. Well, Camp Lo is an interesting mixture of elements. They have a soulful—dare I say blaxploitation—sound to them, without being overbearing or polarizing. They were jazzy, but not as jazzy as Tribe Called Quest, and (for those that checked the bars) subtly street, without being visibly rough. This allowed them to remain a hip-hop group, without being labeled as 'alternative,\" while standing out from the pack. This album was adored by those who took the time to dig deeper than \"Luchini\" and \"Coolie High,\" and is not only a super-lyrical piece of 90s hip-hop history but a gem production-wise. This was the album that Ski Beatz was working on when he was tapped by Dame Dash to work on Reasonable Doubt, where he placed \"Dead Presidents,\" \"Feelin' It,\" and \"22 Twos\" amongst other things. Ski went on to produced a lot of records for Camp-Lo—their next two albums in fact.\n\nThe duo quietly released On The Way Uptown this past weekend as a nod to the milestone. Those who loved the (original) album will love it; it's chock full of unreleased demo's and more. It's available now on every streaming service, so give it a spin.\n\nMany anniversaries made me feel old last year, but this one hits closer to home; it holds up so well, and it's ironically timeless blend of jazz/funk and 70s soul-aesthetic has allowed it to age [very] well. The often thrown around term classic has to be earned—Uptown Saturday Night has done just that, in my humble opinion. \"This is it—what!\"\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GG405y51cVk\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3nA3OgqWaw\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqS5D9ebuok",

    "content_html": "[dropcap]I[/dropcap]t wouldn't be accurate to call Soulja unsuccessful by any means; in fact, his debut single went triple platinum. Realistically, he's still eating off of that. He has emerged as a smart businessman, though, spinning his single into a $23 million-plus empire that spans from endorsement deals, television--even a club--as well as his questionable music. With a decade in the game, he's proved himself to be a trendsetter in every sense of the word. \n\nMost recently, he's kept his name ringing with an almost calculated series of 'tough-guy-isms' that have inadvertently amused black twitter to no end—but, the joke is really on us. Whether brandishing guns on the gram, beefing with Yachty over a girl, embellishing an attempted robbery story or—within the past 24 hours—throwing shots of Chris Brown [sigh] and (seemingly) being robbed while showing his hood-cred via Facebook live, he's managed to keep his name ringing, for better or for worse. I almost liken it to Lil' B; those who like him love him. There's no middle ground, ultimately.\n\nHis supporters were out in full force recently and ready to offer praise to young Soulja after he gave his fans a gift—free Bluetooth headphones. Granted, there was a questionably high shipping rate attached to that, but still, he's doing his best to weigh the Good with the bad. As well, last weekend's #souljaboychallenge made a potentially embarrassing situation a social media phenomenon. This all adds fuel to the flame, and makes the probability of him snagging more lucrative endorsements that much more likely. We he lacks in actual bars, he's seemingly making up for with racks and success.\n\nI ain't even mad—get yours, kid!\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Q-MZimHiLY\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33NQBl25ybc\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dK-lhBS5-sI",

With a cadence that almost resembles J Cole, the young artist isn't married to hip-hop exclusively and dabbles in a sound that more accurately resembles 'hip-pop,' although he has bars [evidenced by his remix of Wizkid's Afropop hit, \"Final (Baba Nla)\"]. This loose allegiance to one particular sound not only paints a picture of him as a real artist but also makes his catalog of music currently available deliciously eclectic; an example of this is his unique spin on Jason Chen's acoustic version of \"Photograph.\"\n\n\"For me, it's never been about proving myself the best rapper or vocalist; there's always going to be someone who has me beat at that,\" he points out. \"If I could, however, give the best feeling to a listener with just one song, then I feel like I've succeeded. That's what my music has always been about; making people feel, and giving them hope from those emotions.\"\n\nHis latest record, \"Everybody Knows,\" is a piano-driven, radio-ready single that helps to establish his sound as established; with a catchy sing-song hook and an undertone of 'look at me I made it,' the record has legs. You can grab it now on iTunes. Check out some of his music below.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cIapbztACPE\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Fe9lRhKJ8",

    "content_html": "[dropcap]M[/dropcap]evoke Dotson is an in-house producer, songwriter, editor, and recording artist over at Mo Res Records—an indie label in Florida. What started at a young age as an affinity for poems grew into hip-hop; the rest just all fell into place. He a relative newcomer, with only a handful of joints out there in the world, but his latest—released on NYE—\"Level 1\" is a great into to him as an artist. The almost ambient chanty production is supplied by the highly acclaimed Clams Casino, who has produced for industry elites like A$AP Rocky, Weeknd, ScHoolboy Q, MF DOOM, Jhené Aiko and many more. Needless to say, it's a song that peaked our interest in the young rapper.\n\nWe decided to learn a little more about him—check out the quick interview below, as well as the new Clams Casino produced record. He's got some heat in store for 2017.\n\nEarly\n\n<iframe src=\"http://www.audiomack.com/embed4-large/mevoke/level-1\" scrolling=\"no\" width=\"100%\" height=\"250\" scrollbars=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe>\n\nHow'd you get into the game?\n\nI was born and raised in Florida (currently resident in Carol City). In '09, I wasn't hearing what I wanted to hear in terms of music. That was when I started writing and recording videos on my brother laptop. Everything I did at that time was only acapella. I started rapping on beats probably like in 2012. I wanted my beats to sound a certain way so then I started producing in high school.\n\nWho would you consider influences?\n\nMy brother put me on to like Ludacris, Eminem, Jay-Z, Fabulous, Lil Wayne... you know? Them. I still listen to them, but as an artist, I feel my responsibility is to bring something new to the table.\n\nWhat have you dropped to date?\n\nLast year I released \"Ace\"—that was a track I produced—and then \"Level 1\" which was produced by a talented artist that goes by the name Clams Casino. I'm working on too much. I'm trying to organize everything; Hopefully, an album comes out of it.\n\nWhat has been your biggest achievement so far?\n\nMy trip to New York early last year was one of my biggest achievements so far. My goal is to make what God wants me to make, nothing more, nothing less.",

    "content_html": "<blockquote>\"The Beautiful Revolution leans on the belief that [in order] to change the world, one must first start with healing their [own] personal scars, which, is a revolution in itself.\" --Mr. P Chill</blockquote>\n[dropcap]M[/dropcap]r. P Chill has been written about before here at AAHH; Still Standing was a solute to the supporters and fans who have kept him going throughout his 23-year marriage to this hip-hop game. His latest record, <em>The Beautiful Revolution</em>, is much more about transcending his music and putting out messages of hope and inspiration, while raising a fist and shaking it intensely at the oppressive powers that current 'rule' over society.\n\nIn contrast to <a href=\"http://aboveaveragehiphop.com/mr-p-chill-23-years-in-the-game/\"><em>Still Standing</em></a>--in many ways--it's much more introspective and personal. On the record \"I Wanna Go Home,\" he alludes to loss and describes his town to town lifestyle as a lonely, never ending search for something he can't quite find. \"If these Tattoos Could Talk\" is a walk down memory lane with the rapper as he describes the meaning behind all of the ink on his body. \"Fighting For The Mic,\" which is a little more light-hearted, is a subtle nod to the early days when he struggled as a white-rapper, fighting for support as he chased his dreams.\n\nRecords like \"<a href=\"http://aboveaveragehiphop.com/p-chill-pens-letter-to-corrupt-police/\">Dear Crooked Cop</a>,\" which we posted a month or so back, and \"Beautiful Revolution,\" featuring J.Smo focus on the social injustice and tension between communities and law-enforcement being felt across the country; it's interesting, as he is a white rapper. Not too many are this outspoken--it truly makes the subject less racial and more human. A good portion of the other records focuses on the sheer volume of mind-boggling things happening across the nation--from the election results to various forms of racial/socio-political and economic discrimination taking place.\n\nThe balance of this project is the fact that there are checks and balances--as much awareness as it brings to the ill of today's [frightening] realities, it also provides motivation for change. \"Change The World,\" for example, shows the forward thinking P has about the power of his music and platform. He also once again links up with Spyder D--the first rapper in history to release an independent record-- for the funky \"Gonna Be Alright,\" which serves as the outro and perfect decompression track.\n\nProduction-wise, the album is much more dynamic than the last, with some eclectic vibes that remain cohesive to the overall thematic flow of the sequencing--which is quite good. Beats like the Lionel Richie-sampled \"Hello\" and the Buffalo Springfield-sampled \"Right In Front Of Your Eyes\" add lots of depth to the project. Overall, another dope release from P. Chill--one of the hardest-working indie rappers we know!\n\n<iframe style=\"border: 0; width: 100%; height: 120px;\" src=\"https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=1460718233/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/tracklist=false/artwork=small/transparent=true/\" width=\"300\" height=\"150\" seamless=\"\"><a href=\"http://mrpchill.bandcamp.com/album/i-wanna-go-home-feat-julie-rush\">I Wanna Go Home (feat.

    "content_html": "[dropcap]T[/dropcap]he UK trio of We'll See, Treece and producer Hyro--collectively known as SWMS--started 2017 off with an exciting new project, <em>Constructions Tape</em>. The 11 track project is packed with lo-fi hip-hop goodness, grimy underground production (with a few exceptions like \"La tristesse durera toujours\" and \"SNES CD\"), and a whole lot of bars. They also take it a step further, with a visual version of the album; reminiscent of infamous visual albums like Streets Is Watching--albeit with less of a linear story line.\n\nA year's worth of blood sweat and tears, the project is a fantastic dig among the sea of stuff floating the net. Records like the eerie sounding \"D13 KRU\" have an aesthetic that could have dropped from a dubbed Stretch & Bob tape from '95, while the trappish vibe of \"SNES-CD\" and the \"Interlude\" provide a contemporary feel.\n\nWhile there is an obvious 90s East Coast hip-hop influence here, Constructions Tape remains fresh--and incredibly polished. It isn't rushed and doesn't conform to what's \"popping\" which gives it more of a timeless appeal. A bit of poking around, and you'll find these guys have a ton of material out there. This is a dope project, though. Give it a spin and tell a friend--you're welcome!\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MlFWeTwkrzg",

    "content_html": "[dropcap]S[/dropcap]nowgoons, the four-man production/hip-hop outfit comprised of Det Gunner, DJ Illegal, Sicknature, and J.S. Kuster have been one of the most visible best-kept secrets in hip-hop for a while now. With a decade-long rap sheet of content in their catalogue, they’ve made it their business to keep that chunky orchestral boom-bap energy alive and kicking. They’ve been working with a who’s who of golden-age icons, and up and coming underground royalty producing full projects for acts like Philly rapper  Reef the Lost Cauze, legendary Brownsville, Brooklyn, bullies M.O.P., and the newest iteration of Onyx. The latter of that list definitely brought them the most social notoriety, racking up millions of YouTube spins.\n\nIf you<a href=\"http://aboveaveragehiphop.com/my-top-records-of-2016/\"> followed my year end posts</a>, you might have noticed that I placed their latest (compilation) album, <em><a href=\"https://snowgoons.bandcamp.com/album/goon-bap\">Goon Bap</a></em>, amongst my top albums of the year. If you are just getting into these guys, and you at all loved the 90s, this album will blow your mind. Not only is the production incredible, but they somehow connected with cats we haven’t heard of for years, like Nine, for example, who appeared alongside Psycho Les, Sticky Fingaz, Ras Kass, Dres, DoItAll, and OC on one massive posse cut.\n\nI was excited about interviewing them, as I’ve been following them for a while now. Check out the conversation below, and if your haven’t get your hands on <em><a href=\"https://snowgoons.bandcamp.com/album/goon-bap\">Goon Bap</a></em> wherever you stream fine hip-hop.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V5SIjHFL2A\n\n<strong>How did you guys originally get together?</strong>\n\nMe, DJ Illegal, and Det Gunner met in ‘96 at a hip-hop jam in Germany and exchanged Mixtapes. After some time, we did a Mixtape together and had the idea to add some of our own remixes. That’s how we started producing together. Sicknature and J.S. Kuster joined the Goons around 2008 during the work on the second album, <em>Black Snow</em>.\n\n<strong>What is it about 90s hip-hop that's kept you guys so influenced?</strong>\n\nSimply put, that’s the era we grew up with; actually, late 80’s, but still the 90’s had the most impact on us with classic groups like Wu Tang, Mobb Deep, DITC, Onyx and more.\n\n<strong>Tell me about the new album—how did you guys choose the features?</strong>\n\nWe started by picking 90s artists we always liked and wanted to work with. We are really fortunate to have Nine, Dres, Psycho Les and Method Man on the <em><a href=\"https://snowgoons.bandcamp.com/album/goon-bap\">Goon Bap</a></em> album--beside our homies Onyx, OC, Ras Kass. But we wanted to have some new artists as well, and added Chris Rivers, Token, Passionated MC, Big Kurt or Doppelgangaz to name a few.\n\n<strong>Do you see yourself as ushering boom-nap into a new generation? (Particularly by featuring newer artists like Chris Rivers)?</strong>\n\nMaybe, yeah. Overall we’re just doing the music we love so if other people discover the 90s again through our music, I would call that a positive side effect.\n\n<strong>Ok, \"The 90s Are Back,\" what was the process of putting that record together?</strong>\n\nIt all started with the beat. Originally, we wanted to use it for the intro cause it gave us that typical 90s New York Boom-Bap-Jeep-Beats kind of feeling. But then we figured it would be really dope to have some artists like OC or Nine on the song. We couldn't figure out which artists to pick and we decide to make it an All-Star track with many artists. We went with only 8 bars for each Emcee to keep it not too long. The only artists who did a longer verse was Dres with 16 bars and Ras Kass with 12. We just didn’t want to cut them down. Originally, Smoothe Da Hustler and Billy Danze supposed to be on the song too, as well Edo G--but they didn’t make the deadline.\n\n<strong>Some of the artists were crazy unexpected, particularly Nine—how did you pull it off?</strong>\n\nLike we said, we were 100% feeling Nine on this beat in our heads, so we had to track him down.\n\nLuckily, he just visited our homie DJ Eclipse's radio show “Rap Is Outta Control,” so he connected us. After approaching Nine with the idea for the song he was down.\n\n<strong>Tell me about your experience working with Pumpkinhead…</strong>\n\nPH was always a funny, impulsive guy--and artist. He did whatever he wanted and felt like. When we recorded the song for our first album <em>German Lugers</em> back in 2006, he actually did two songs for us just because our session was dope in the studio. We forgot about the second song and it got lost on the old hard drive. When he passed, we wanted to look up some older pictures with him to post and pay some respect. We came across the lost files and instantly had to remix the old song and add it to Goon Bap. It would have been a shame to not release the song.\n\n<strong>What's next up for you guys?</strong>\n\nWe are still working on the Onyx vs. M.O.P. record, we are working on a project with our new artist Big Kurt, as well; Sicknature, of the Snowgoons, is about to drop his solo record this year, too. Besides that, we’re working on a couple of projects that we can’t mention right now. Basically, we stay busy.\n\n<strong>Who do you want to work with that you haven't been able to get yet?</strong>\n\nThere are a couple of artists, like Nas, Immortal Technique and Westside Gunn, who we’ve got on the list. We will see soon or later we might have them down.\n\n<strong>Any last words for our readers?</strong>\n\nWe appreciate the hip-hop culture for letting us express ourselves in the purest form. Our slogan is \"We Keep Hip Hop Alive\" and that’s what we going to do. Make sure you check out the whole <em><a href=\"https://snowgoons.bandcamp.com/album/goon-bap\">Goon Bap</a></em> album because it is way more than just Boom Bap influenced album.

He's been building a heavy buzz gigging across the UK, Europe, and the USA and has become a part of the successful Miami-based collective GTPS. VAS has shared the stage with the likes of DJ Fresh and Ella Eyre--while on tour with Grammy award winning Fat Boy Slim--gaining further exposure and momentum.\n\nLast year, he released his debut LP, <em>Krossover</em>. Critically acclaimed, it was an outstanding self-produced collection of tracks relating to a universal audience. It also debuted at no. 14 in the UK Hip Hop charts--impressive, right? He's takeing his already unconventional approach to rapping to an entirely new level with his upcoming project, <em>Krossover Deluxe</em>. Truly a storyteller in a class of his own, he is set to take 2017 by storm.\n\nCheck out the first single from the project, \"Active,\" below.

    "content_html": "<blockquote>\"The appetite kill us has never really gone--when slavery was abolished coz they never viewed wrong\" --Goddaz</blockquote>\n[dropcap]I[/dropcap]n hip-hop, you can never underestimate the power of a good story. 50 was shot nine times, for example. This statement is exemplified in award-winning UK rapper Goddaz. He's managed to make a name for himself in London town after having escaped the unimaginable horrors of Uganda's civil war. Put that into perspective--rappers like Drake are out here claiming they started from the bottom! Not to say he was at the bottom--but he had a mindstate altering existence that has helped to mold his artistic voice in a humbling way that makes him quite inspirational.\n\nHis new project, <em>Group Economics</em>, is a seven-song EP that has quite a few different flavors; however, I've never quite come across a project with this type of content. Unlike 50, he doesn't rub his past in your face--rather he acknowledges the blessings he has and uses his past as a catalyst for motivational messages. Referring to his past life as like\"Saving Private Ryan\" on the record \"Get Busy Living,\" he quick to point out that \"your life is lying that why the streets ain't buying.\" That's the coolest part about this project--it's real life! People who live through crazy shit often don't go out of their way to glorify it. Goddaz has been through a lot in his life, and his music carries that weight; you can hear sincerity in his words.\n\nHe spends a lot time on records like \"Sweet\" and \"Change Now\" focusing on how an increase in education around financial health (investing, etc.) can help to put the streets in a better place. It's all facts, too. There is also some lighter notes here, such as the Pan-African female-focused \"It's You,\" and the ultra-deep \"Still Going\" where he describes his life story--including his time in the streets, and his ultimate path towards a positive life.\n\nCommercialization is often described as a second form of slavery--and he is having no part of it. Social injustice and economic disparity runs rampant--so why are we only rapping about whips and chains? Goddaz breaks the cycle with a project full of positivity and truth. <strong><a href=\"http://amzn.eu/f6BIesx\">EP is available for pre order now</a>--</strong>and will be<strong> </strong>out the 26th of March on all online digital stores.

    "content_html": "<blockquote>\"[Andre 3000] just sat next to us eating tomato soup, pretty much just talking about how much of a big fan he is of us.\"</blockquote>\n[dropcap]D[/dropcap]ivine Council--the foursome of Lord Linco, Cyrax!, ICYTWAT, and $ilkmoney--is undoubtedly one of the more exciting acts that are destined to bloom into fruition this year; they have a cult following that is crazy about them. Rightfully so, they were co-signed by Erykah Badu and Andre 3000 late last summer and were signed by LA Reid, the guy behind all of the most influential acts in modern urban music. While they may appear at first glance to just be 'riding the wave' of current music bumped by the 90s babies, clearly there is something there.\n\nTheir EP was fascinating--as I wrote last year--so it'll be exciting to follow them as they inevitably turn Super Saiyan. I was able to chat with the guys a few months back--and you can now check out that conversation below as they describe what was essentially the best day ever (up to that point in their lives). If you're not up on the guys, get familiar.\n\nEarly.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNqz2WAG7bs\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCGbzbba2H0\n\n<strong>You’re standing in an office, and you're talking to LA Reid. What's that like?\n</strong>\nHonestly, that shit was too good to be true. That was like seeing the movies for real; it was some movie shit, he just came in and explained how it worked. It was all organic. I'm not sure how those meetings usually go down, but I know niggas usually gotta meet with an A&R. We didn't have to do that, we went straight to LA Reid, he wanted to meet us himself--and it was all love. We was just cooling with that nigga, vibing down, and then after we were done playing our song he was like, 'Yo, I'm gonna do this.' That shit was cool as fuck. Even up to today, it was like one of the best days ever.\n\nThat was the same day that we met TWAT too; That was the first time we had officially linked up in person, which was a very momentous occasion for real. [TWAT is from Chicago.]\n\n<strong>So what I'd heard too is that one of the driving forces of getting you guys to LA Reid is that you had a pretty major cosign by Andre 3000. How did Andre 3000 reach out to you?\n</strong>\nWe had got flown out to New York for the first time to do a show at SOB's--this was like the first big show that we'd done. We never really did a show like that. Mainly all the shows we'd usually do would be in Richmond bars, and nobody would come, or it would be some lame bullshit happening, so this was like our first real show. So we went out to New York and met up with Dom and Chris, and Dom was going to get her hair done, and when she came back they had Andre with them, and we just looked up like 'What the fuck?' Because I'd never even seen a famous person up close. We had never seen a celebrity up close, so first thing when we saw him we were like, 'this nigga looks like Andre 3000,' and it turns out it was [deadass] him.\n\nHe just sat next to us, and he was talking about how big a fan he was of us, and how his son Seven had put him on to our music, which was crazy. He just sat next to us eating tomato soup, pretty much just talking about how much of a big fan he is of us, and we've been big fans of him all our lives, so it was crazy to hear that coming from the other way from somebody like him.\n\n<strong>I think what's cool too about you guys is, it feels very organic; you know what I mean? It feels like overnight out of nowhere you guys appeared, but it feels like there's been a little bit of thought process.\n</strong>\nI talk about that shit with my niggas all the time. It's a lot of niggas out here in the game that have that machine behind them, and it's a very inorganic push; you can tell that a lot of the shit that's popping right now is forced. Divine Council, we didn't force ourselves to link up, we didn't force ourselves to make the songs, we didn't force ourselves to make the moves we made. Everything we did and that happened, happened organically and for a reason.\n\n<strong>So maybe talk about your EP. Talk about <em>Council World</em> and the process of putting that together.\n</strong>\nThe process of putting <em>Council World</em> together was a whole new experience for us. We wanted to put a lot more songs on it, but it was more of a time thing. It was [really] to get fans who don't know about us to catch up, trying to get everybody and the general public caught up on us before we start going hard. We're just trying to get everybody familiar with the Council.\n\n<strong>It felt like it had different flavors to it, too. It wasn't just one type of thing. It hit a couple of different checkboxes, you know?\n</strong>\nYeah. With the <em>Council World</em> EP, there's definitely a song on there for every occasion, every moment. That's how all our music is, honestly. Every single one of our songs, we as artists don't stay in one lane. We all have different styles and stuff we would just go off of, and stuff like that, a bunch of influences, so we have songs for every moment, every occasion, every emotion, every feel.\n\n<strong>How do you guys see the dynamic of the group playing out? When I look at something like Odd Future, it's a weird dynamic, because I guess Tyler's the leader, but it's hard to put it together, and some people do solo stuff. So, what's the dynamic of the group going to be?\n</strong>\nWell, Divine Council, we're kind of like Odd Future, but I feel like every group is different. We're not like the regular rap groups of back in the days; you know how like every rap group, they had to be on every song together. <em>Divine Council</em>, we're a collective. Everybody in Divine Council, overall <em>Divine Council</em> is a group, and we're family, but everybody in the Council is their own artist. But Divine Council were like a collective.\n\n<strong>So what's next? What are you guys working on next? Are we going to get a full project, like a full LP?\n</strong>\nWe've got a lot of shit. Honestly, as of right now, we're working on our individual projects and stuff, like TWAT is about to drop Milk, which is like his baby. That's the project he's working on right now, and the project that he's taking his time on to perfect, just to make it perfect. Cyrax is working on his album - we all just working, so that's all we can do is just work. So many ideas for videos, and so much new music coming out. Endless working, man. That's all we're doing.",

    "content_html": "[dropcap]W[/dropcap]e wrote about St. Louis rapper EJ Carter <a href=\"http://aboveaveragehiphop.com/ej-carter-bringing-originality-back/\">last year when he dropped the visual for \"True\" off of his electrifying debut album, <i>Notorious</i></a>. The album amassed almost 500k plus streams worldwide and helped him to spark the industry's interest in not only his unique brand of music--which is some of the most exciting sounds from the Midwest since Nelly's diamond selling <i>Country Grammar</i>--but his brand, the R$F Voice, as well. He was (optically) quite quiet for 2016, opting to connect all the dots, officially signing the artists and producers along with the behind-the-scenes staff members to his label. He appeared on some the [roster's] records/singles and set the stage for a big 2017.\n\nWell, the year is off to a great start; his (yeat old) record \"On God\" picked up steam in a major way, approaching a million views and landing on Spotify's “Discover Weekly” charts. As well, his latest single is almost at 500k spins in under a week! The song, \"Can I Juug?\" is about seizing any current opportunity, EJ explained to AAHH. \"I'm asking if I can do my thing. With everyone showing hate, can I just 'Juug' out here?\"\n\nThe catchy hook, which drives the record, is clearly winning over audiences—as are his big bars, such \"bang hammers like Thor, but I'm low key.\" Although his production is very contemporary in its [sonic] structure, his wordplay coupled with his overall aesthetic and look make his brand very appealing.\n\nI stand by my earlier statements <a href=\"http://aboveaveragehiphop.com/ej-carter-bringing-originality-back/\">written back in 2016</a>--EJ is bringing back originality. At his current trajectory, it's hard to imagine that he won't be a name you hear a lot more about over the next 365 days. Check out the new single--and \"On God\"--below. If you haven't already, add EJ Carter to your \"must-watch\" list.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/iBLUPoT5LU0\n\nhttps://youtu.be/iF9dkjJKVHc",

    "content_html": "[dropcap]L[/dropcap]ast year we took some time to review and album entitled <a href=\"http://aboveaveragehiphop.com/domestik-the-transition-from-then-to-now/\"><i>The Transition From Then To Now</i></a> by a Toronto-based rapper named Domestik; well, he's back, and in good form. Only another Toronto head can say this, but his cadence and flow remind me of the golden era of mega-city hip-hop—ripe with 'Bacardi Slang.' His low-key, sometimes over-packed bars, almost make it easy to miss the depth of his latest project <i>Forget The Past Remember The Future</i> is if you don't listen to every word. A solid listen, though, reveals an incredibly heavy album with dark imagery and timely insight that reveal a lot about his personal life and values.\n\nFrom the onset of his first song, \"Lucky Day,\" where everything was good until he [fictitiously] got a girl pregnant, you get the feeling this project might 'go there.' He tackles a bevy of topics, from race relations on the record \"Colours,\" the absurdity of gun control on the record \"Way Of The Gun.\" Then there's the over sexualization of women—amongst other things—on \"4 Devils,\" and even plays out the rest of his life on \"My Two Eye.\" What is curious here, though, is what's real and what's just rap. His last album was so honest, and the last song on this album, \"I'm Sorry,\" is so raw and personal, so it makes you wonder where the line of fiction ends. Does he know the party girl on \"Brown Girl Lost\"?\n\nSome of the songs have an almost ominous tone to them like \"The Last Temptation,\" in which (again amongst other things) he describes a priest in a sexual act or the inner workings of a high school shooter on \"Darkness.\"\n\nOverall, it's an interesting collection of music. The last time around, my main criticism was that his music bordered on TMI--so I'm happy to hear that he's opened up his music and let it speak more broadly, with more potential interpretation. He's noted that he has no rights to the musical compositions, which includes DC rapper/producer Oddisee, Japanese record producer Nujabes (who passed away in 2010), and more, so this could be considered more of a mixtape. It's a weird, kind of dark, listen—give it a shot.\n\n \n\n<center>\n<iframe style=\"border: 0; width: 600px; height: 472px;\" src=\"https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=2336035295/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/artwork=small/transparent=true/\" width=\"300\" height=\"150\" seamless=\"\"><a href=\"http://domestik.bandcamp.com/album/forget-the-past-remember-the-future\">Forget the Past, Remember the Future by Domestik</a></iframe></center>",

    "content_html": "[dropcap]2[/dropcap]6-year-old artist Chames, who hails from Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, has been writing songs and poetry since the age of 10—and lyrics/substance have always been at the forefront of his music. \"Expect to hear everything from introspection, to ego-driven lyrics, to spirituality, and—above all else—the plight and triumphs of a young adult,\" he explains. \"I'm trying to navigate my way through life; I'm just honest with all of the thoughts and emotions that come along with it whether they be good and bad.\" With a kind of underwhelming web presence and an album which seemed to relatively untouched by many ears, I'll admit my skepticism going into this project which made it's way across my desk. I'm glad I gave it a spin, though. It's a gem that I think y'all should mess with. Sonically a vibe that would make fans of Chance The Rapper happy, with a sense of wordplay that puts me in the mind of someone like Consequence.\n\n<i>Self-Actualization 2</i> is such a refreshing listen—especially after the weekend we've seen across the nation. At ten songs, with a few very uplifting skits, the project is packed with knowledge of self, motivation, wisdom, and bars galore. It kicks off with \"Inside You,\" a song that eloquently explains that everything you truly need to be happy is already inherently inside of you—we're just often blinded by the world full of visual white noise that keeps us focused on the wrong things. This sense of knowing yourself is all about the project and exemplified in wise words of both Martin Luther King and Obama—whom he credits on \"Listen To The Kids\" as 'Uncle Barack'—set to melodic instrumentals. What's cool is that he doesn't pretend to be without fault; he sounds young, but reformed, with a sense of wisdom that only comes from a profound realization.\n\nThe bouncy Kid Jimi produced \"No Tomorrow,\" with its soul-sampled hook was the highlight of the album for me.\n\n\"I'm just an artist who is here to give you my truth,\" he explains on his website. \"I recount the ways of this land as I see it; the emotions that result are universally relatable.\" That pretty sums up this project: relatable motivation. I'd like to hope this is the direction hip-hop is going—because it needs more leaders in this space and time!\n\nEarly.\n\n<iframe src=\"http://www.audiomack.com/embed4-album/chames-1/self-actualization-2\" scrolling=\"no\" width=\"100%\" height=\"350\" scrollbars=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe>",

Ultimately, the brainchild of the late Lee O’Denat was a mirror pointed directly at a subsection of the web that helped to bolster the site's staggering level of daily traffic. It effectively says more about its users than it does about Q. Shit, all he does is aggregate the content—he doesn't film the fights, ratchet music videos and public shaming. He also didn't grant them the millions of views they received. Supply and demand.\n\nAs far as web-entrepreneurs go, Q is an inspirational figure; what began as a mixtape site—which was eventually hacked—grew into a simple aggregator that became a culture shifting source of what's what and who's who. Q and his wife (the site's co-founder) created an inescapable pillar, which serves as almost a hip-hop centric Reddit, for lack of a better explanation. As a fellow urban website owner, it's impossible not to acknowledge Q as the g.o.a.t of this!\n\nTragically, Q passed away this week as the result of heart disease that was [likely] heavily influenced by obesity; as the RIP messages pop up, I have seen some rather disturbing rhetoric about how deplorable WSHH is, as though that in some way reflects directly upon the site's creator. Aside from label submitted and exclusive premieres—both paid—the site was made up of user-generated content. Just putting that out there.\n\nWSHH is an incredible accomplishment, even as just an ideological concept—and it's one that Q was proud of. Prayers are with his family and close friends in this one as they deal with the loss. The site's future is up in the air; but, it will never be quite the same.\nRIP, Q.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvwlYrPeSe8",

    "content_html": "[dropcap]W[/dropcap]ashington, D.C., rapper Miko Suave sounds like a lost relic in a sea of drops we've received this week. \"I would describe my style as a gumbo of all the greats,\" he says about his style, \"I study all the greats to become greater--and I don't do this for the money; I do it for the love of the sport first!\" His latest effort <em>G.E.M.$. (GREEN EYED MONSTER$)</em>, available on DatPiff, is a hefty [20-song] collection of music that most closely resembles the mixtape circuit of 2002-2004 that dominated the streets of New York City and made stars out of outfits like G-Unit and Dipset. With raw sounding tracks (that have a <em>ripped from somewhere</em> aesthetic), streetwise bars, and hella punchlines, the project--although a big listen at 20 shots--is a great listen none the less.\n\nLet's start with the goods: there is a lot here. I'll be honest and admit that at such a big length--based on my lifestyle--I found it difficult to donate enough of my time to give it a straight through; consequently I did it in chunks. This isn't an issue, as the project doesn't flow like a straight narrative by any means, but rather a collection of songs. Some of the production feels a little dated, like \"We Livin'\" that has a Cassidy, \"Hustlin',\" backbone to it, but for the most part, it's well curated. He hits his stride on records like \"Rollin' In His Grave\" where he calls out rappers with fake images, claiming they [figuratively] have Pac and Big rolling in they graves--amidst a heap of hip-hop references that show off his knowledge of the culture. Also, his flow on \"90z Shit\" was on-point; this project is also timely, with not-so-subtle commentary on the perceived rise of systematic racism and injustice we're [likely] to see as the result of Trump taking office: \"He's a billionaire and money is the root of all evil.\"\n.\nOverall, the 24-year-old rapper--with a cadence that resembles Cassidy blended with young upstart <a href=\"http://aboveaveragehiphop.com/meet-chris-rivers-son-late-great-big-pun/\">Chris Rivers</a>--shows a ton of potential; it would be interesting to hear him on a more polished, focused project--but he more than has my attention.\n\n<iframe src=\"http://www.datpiff.com/embed/m31c6d67/\" width=\"600\" height=\"470\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe>",

The track, entitled \"Dear Rocafella,\" is a throwback to that classic soul sound that made the crew [at their height] so monumental. With a Just Blaze summer '02 vibe, Taj shows the utmost respect for not just the label and artists--but the staff and background players. Described as \"Nothing short of greatness\" by Jigga's (former) personal DJ, Green Lantern, the record has some legs to it.\n\nIt's the first single off of the upcoming new EP Watchmen and Taj are cheffing up--and it sounds like it's going to crazy.

    "excerpt": null,
    "content_html": "[dropcap]T[/dropcap]he Dirty Dozen--more affectionately known as D12--started out in Detroit back in 1996. The group went through numerous iterations before it's final and most well-known line-up that shot to superstardom. For starters, original member Eminem left the group to pursue his fairy tale solo career under the tutelage of the iconic Dr. Dre. Most notably, though, member Bugz was murdered following an altercation at a picnic leaving an obvious black cloud and hole in the group. Eminem stepped up to fill the gap; however--as per Bugz's final request--Swift (also known as Swifty McVay) who was a member of another local group, Da Rabeez also joined the group. The group went on to record Devil's Night, which put platinum plaques on all of their walls and saw the group tour the world.\n\nSwift, though, has remained a solo act throughout the years and his experience as part of the chart-topping group; he's released six solo albums, three mixtapes and made a host of notable charting features. D12 remains active--and has a new project dropping in 2017--however, Swifty continues to expand his personal catalogue with his upcoming album, <em><a href=\"http://smarturl.it/SwiftyMcVay\">Grey Blood</a></em>, which features Crooked I, Guilty Simpson, Slum Village and more.\n\nRecently, Swifty took some time out to chat with AAHH about the new project, his history with D12 and. Check out the interview and new remix of \"<a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/dafyredapartment-313/swifty-mcvay-ft-kuniva-bizarre-here-2-party-prod-mr-porter\">Here 2 Party</a>\" featuring Slum Village below. Pre-order <a href=\"http://smarturl.it/SwiftyMcVay\"><em>Grey Blood</em></a> here.\n\nhttps://soundcloud.com/dafyredapartment-313/here-2-party-remix-feat-slum-village\n\n<strong>How did you join D12? Did you know it was going to be as big as it was?\n</strong>\nWell, I was always affiliated with D12. I was there when Proof first built the movement. We all met at the legendary Hip-Hop Shop in Detroit, Michigan, where we all freestyled every Saturday for a good five or six years. Proof had whispered in the ears of all these MCs and asked them if they wanted to be a part of D12, and first, it was 12 members. I was already a part of a group called Da Rabeez. We had a deal with Robbins Entertainment. So, when D12 was formulated, I would always support D12, and D12 would always support my group--and me. It wasn't anything new; the chemistry was already there because there was already a friendship. So, when Bugz, rest in peace, thought that I should be a part of the group, a lot of people out there thought that I replaced Bugz, but I didn't replace Bugz. If. Bugz was still living, he would have been in the group with us. That's how I got into D12, but it wasn't like I was the new guy that had to get to know everybody. I already had years invested with them from supporting each other as friends, and on projects, etc.\n\n<strong>How do you navigate from there to being a solo artist?\n</strong>\nWell, this is the thing. I was already a part of a group called Rabeez, so one of my ex-rap partners went out and grabbed deal out in California, which left me here in Detroit to be a solo artist. I didn't have plans of being a solo artist, but maybe for several months, I started recording my music solo wise for the first time in my life. Me and my ex-rap partner, we'd been rocking since like junior high, so here I am--a solo artist for the first time, being able to go over to the studio, do songs, and I was even doing these shows at different places around the city. So, everybody had the chance to see what I could do solo-wise for a little while before I even actually got a part in D12.\n\n<strong>Did a part of you wanted to be a solo artist even throughout the process of being part of D12?\n</strong>\nWell, I always wanted to be a solo artist. One thing about D12 is, when it all got narrowed down to six guys, it was already a solo thing going on with everybody. I was already Swifty, but for years and years, we all agreed when we got with D12, we were going to bring another identity to the table to make out who we were in the group. So, you got Swifty, and once I entered D12, it was Swifty McVay. So, we already had our soloism inside of it, we all just had an understanding that when we got with D12, that we were going to have two identities. So, like Eminem for instance, he was always Eminem, but he agreed when he got into D12, he turned into Slim Shady.\n\n<strong>That makes sense. But did it have like a Wu-Tang feel to it? Because Em went solo, and Em did that stuff, but he was Eminem, you know what I mean? In the same way that Wu-Tang is Wu-Tang, but Meth and Ghost tend to eclipse U-God.\n</strong>\nYeah, see Em, was already Em, I was already Swifty, Proof was Proof, but we decided now that we in D12, let's go ahead and get two identities. We're all going to be solo artists, but in D12 we're going to have this name, and whoever blew up first would come back and build everybody else. And yeah, we were like the big Wu-Tang Clan thing in the middle 90s, because at first, like I said, it was 12 members, and it narrowed down to six. So, Wu-Tang was the biggest thing since ice-cream; we tried to mimic them as far as the volume of members because people came and went. You had members that were in, then members that were out, so that's how it was.\n\n<strong>Does D12 have more shit coming out?\n</strong>\nYeah, right now we got a lot of songs in the vault and we're all collaborating together to see what we all want to do to make this thing big, man. We want to come out this year; in 2016, everybody had meetings about what we want to do to get into a situation that's going to be comfortable for everyone. Marshall Mathers, Paul Rosenberg, we all in discussion right now, so we will have another D12 album, but there's not anything carved in stone as far as the date.\n\n<strong>Let’s talk about your new project and your music that you're working on. For somebody that hasn't delved into your catalog that deep, you've done a lot of stuff. You've had numerous albums and mixtapes, so you've been on the scene for a long time, so I guess from that perspective it's like you're not new at this. So, maybe this project, kind of what's changed? What's new? What can fans expect?\n</strong>\nWell, they can go a little bit more in depth with knowing where I came from as a solo artist. A lot of people know where I come from as far as D12 and that history is concerned. But, a lot of my solo records, I never really went in depth with a lot of people knowing the history of what I went through, where I came from, and the struggles, trials and tribulations that made me who I am. I mean, I touched on it with the last album that dropped in 2015. But, this album goes a little bit more personal, and that's why I called it <em>Grey Blood</em> because there's a lot of grey areas in my life that a lot of my fans don't know about. They know me as Swifty McVay the MC, but I think they deserve to know more. I need to be a little bit more transparent with them.\n\n<strong>What are some of the highlights of that project, and what do you have coming up from it?\n</strong>\nI got a remix of \"<a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/dafyredapartment-313/swifty-mcvay-ft-kuniva-bizarre-here-2-party-prod-mr-porter\">Here 2 Party</a>\"coming out with Slum Village; I got a track on the album with D12--and, a track with an underground artist who got a lot of notoriety overseas, Guilty Simpson, and more.\n\n<strong>It’s cool to hear that D12 is all still connected, it's still cordial, everybody's happy, and what's exciting too, I was reading about the new album, you were saying that Em is on it, which is dope too, right?\n</strong>\nYeah, I mean like I said man, we got a bond that's way bigger than music, and of course like brothers we're all gonna have our differences and what not. But, at the same time, we understand that this is where we come from, and this brand is what made us. We can't shake that. It ain't going nowhere. No matter how much you try to shake it, no matter how much you get mad, whatever, we all are one in the core understanding that you've got to come back home, you know what I'm saying? Grew up in the same house still, you know.\n\n<strong>Absolutely. And that is unique, right? Because if you're not from Detroit, your entry to D12 might have been Eminem. So, from the perspective of a listener who maybe lives in Germany or something, he might look at Eminem and D12 the same way that someone might have looked at Nelly and the St. Lunatics, you know what I mean? But none of those groups are together today.\n</strong>\nLike I said, you've got to be brothers first, you know what I'm saying? And if you're all on one accord on that first, then the music is second. But even though sometimes music brings people together, and people can create love through music, that brotherhood trumps everything. So, once you have a great understanding on that level, you all can disagree, or fall out, or whatever, the Brotherhood is what's going to bring you back, and of course the music is going to come with it.",

    "content_html": "[dropcap]V[/dropcap]ersatility is the key--that's the personal motto for Long Island, New York, rapper Ruff. An incredibly dynamic rapper with the music business [figuratively] in his blood, he's studied from the best and is ready to put his best forward with his upcoming release of Walk With Me 2. Having recently scored a win at the Power 105 \"I Got The Power\" showcase--opening up some great opportunities--we took a few minutes to chat with the young emcee. Check out the interview below--and get familiar with his other stuff before the new project drops.\n\n<iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https://api.soundcloud.com/users/145957150&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true\" width=\"100%\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"no\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe>\n\n<strong>How did growing up in NYC help develop your love of hip-hop?</strong>\n\nGrowing up in NYC, Hip-Hop was [the] culture. It guided almost every move I made: the way I spoke, how I dressed, and the things liked. It taught me confidence, charisma, and swag; I knew the words to my favorite songs before I knew my homework. Hip Hop was everything. New York and Hip Hop taught me to create what I love, even if no one's listening or watching. Lock me in a room alone all day, and the music will never change. I will never change. My music reflects NYC, Long Island, Hip Hop, culture, and me.\n\n<strong>How did you get into making music?</strong>\n\nAlways had a love for music seeing my family (father, cousins) get into music (producing) and the joy and excitement it brought to them, I knew I wanted to create. Started making beats first and found that writing songs--and that challenge--was not only more fun, but it evoked even more of those reactions and feelings out of people.\n\n<strong>Your father was involved in music--how did that influence you?</strong>\n\nAs a poet and producer, my father played a significant role as a teacher to me. As a poet, along with NY hip hop, he taught me that rap is an art form, not just rhyming words together but being smart and witty. He taught me to take pride and treat it like an actual art form, not a hobby. With each line/bar try to evoke an emotion or produce a reaction from the listener. As a producer, my father taught me everything I know. Introducing me to beat making programs, showing me how to use them, explaining the terms, guiding me, then eventually leaving me alone allowing me to learn and grow on my own.\n\n<strong>How would you describe your music?</strong>\n\nMore so than 'bringing New York Rap back,' I'm trying to be the new wave/evolution of New York hip-hop. [I'm bringing] the old school boom bap and heavy lyric sculpting mixed with the New York charm, slick talk, style, flow, versatility and some Long Island flash. I chase a feeling with my music never a sound or a trend. I want to evoke a feeling, and it's a different feeling every time; sometimes I want to dance, so I want to create music for everyone to dance to, at times I wanna hurt feelings, so I create aggressive content. Sometimes I feel hurt, so I express that pain and capture that feeling in the beat and lyrics. Sometimes I start a beat with no emotion and draw the feeling from what the beat is telling me.\n\n<strong>You recently took first prize at the Power 105 \"I Got the Power\" showcase in Brooklyn. How does that motivate you?</strong>\n\nYeah--I performed three records off of the upcoming project, <em>Walk With Me 2</em>. The win was just a stepping stone and confidence builder. It was reassurance that performing the music I love, can hit and receive the same energy and reaction it gives me.\n\n<strong>And part of that win is getting a single spun on the station--which is a major look. What record are you going to drop?</strong>\n\nIt's between \"Warning You\" and \"In They Place.\" \"Warning You\" is a Hip Hop and 90's Dancehall collab. High energy smooth dance/wine music. \"Warning You\" is a gritty, high energy New York anthem.\n\n~Stay tuned!\n\nFollow him on <a href=\"http://www.instagram.com/godhasgiven\">Instagram </a>and <a href=\"http://www.twitter.com/godhasgiven\">Twitter</a>: @godhasgiven",

    "content_html": "[dropcap]M[/dropcap]-Dot is a name that's been floating around in my circle for a while; even his team has been on me over Instagram. The last straw was when a member of the Snowgoons camp shot me an email last week asking me if I'd heard his latest single (produced by them). I thought to myself, \"I'm missing out.\" So I popped in <a href=\"https://m-dotboston.bandcamp.com/album/ego-and-the-enemy\"><em>Ego And The Enemy</em></a> and zoned out for two complete spins--man, did I sleep on him.\n\nAt seventeen gems, the Boston rapper has a super impressive line-up of production credits on here, like Snowgoons (whose Goon Bap was one of my top albums of 2016), Large Professor, Marco Polo, Buckwild, Hi-Tek, and more--not to mention cuts from the legendary Marley Marl. There are also some guest vocals from the likes of Method Man, the elusive Krumb Snatcha, and Camp-Lo, who recently celebrated 20 years since their debut album Uptown Saturday Night. Bar-wise, the dude is legit--which wasn't surprising; his bar over bar flow (reminiscent of RA Da Ruggedman) and track record of features is insane, and he's toured the world and shared stages with royalty.\n\nThis doesn't seem forced--he's not at all a culture vulture just dropping dollars to give tech effect of credibility; he's earned his stripes. He's won regional accolades previously granted to artists like Guru, Edo G, Mr. Lif--so, he's in the lane. <a href=\"https://m-dotboston.bandcamp.com/album/ego-and-the-enemy\"><em>Ego And The Enemy</em></a> is a fresh listen; my personal highlights were \"Gleamin'\" (the record with Marley Marl cuts), \"Shine\" with Meth. Also, don't snooze on \"Fugazzi,\" which recently got a video treatment. Get up on M-dot!!!\n\nEarly.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vonu1zMolsQ\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtdEFA62_OI\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8DiZ89oCqU",

Today's breed of artists [not all, but many] are driven by more of an economic stimulus, rather than a genuine spiritual connection to what they're doing. That's what makes Souleye's story so devastating endearing; his brand of positivism is the soundtrack that counters a lot of what's shoved down our throats on a daily basis.\n\nHe fell in love with the culture during—arguably—the best year in hip-hop [1996] while freestyling with his friends around a bonfire. He began to take things pretty serious around 2001. But, after the loss of his best-friend in 2003, which resulted in him taking solitude in the woods of Mount Greylock, Massachusetts (where he composed an album), and the suicide of his brother, he changed his perspective, focus, and drive. Affixed to the ceiling where his brother hung himself, was a sticker that read \"Music Matters;\" this has become a mantra for the ultra-conscious genre-bending artist, who we actually <a href=\"http://aboveaveragehiphop.com/souleye-labeled-audio/\">shared with you last year</a>.\n\nFresh off of his LP, <em>Shapeshifting</em>, an album which marked a decade since his well received 2005 release <em>Intergalactic Vibes</em>, his latest single \"Snow Angel,\" featuring his wife (award-winning Canadian songstress Alanis Morisette). It's an airy mashup of hip-hop and EDM—paired with a very slick visual, complete with interpretive dance and atmospheric visual effects that fit the song like a glove. Souleye has received LOTS of acclaim and isn't a new artist by any stretch, but it's not too late to catch up. Visit his website and dig through his catalog. First, though, give \"Snow Angel\" a spin.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2Q1CeYa9bU",

    "content_html": "[dropcap]T[/dropcap]he homie Oneup2Lovett has become a regular indie feature here at AAHH; in the past, we've featured numerous videos, including his mini-movie \"<a href=\"http://aboveaveragehiphop.com/oneup2lovett-tru-mini-movie/\">Tru</a>,\" and his <a href=\"http://aboveaveragehiphop.com/oneup2lovett-influenced-mixtape/\"><em>Influenced</em> </a>mixtape. One thing we haven't done, though, is let him speak directly to all y'all out there. So--unbelievably--this is our first and (likely) not last interview with the Michigan-based rapper who we've sworn to follow as he navigates his way through this crazy game of [rap] life.\n\nCheck out the short interview below, and head over to iTunes and cop his latest release, <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/by-the-end-of-november/id1200469209\"><em>By the end of November</em></a>.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQhQ-91iZu4\n\n<strong>Tell me about the music\n</strong>\nI've got a long way to go, but I think I'm finding my way pretty well, making my [own] sound.\n\n<strong>Describe your sound.\n</strong>\nI think It shines light on both sides of the fence--it's a story of a young black male who's grown up in an urban area, seeing his parents work to give him and his siblings a better life. It's kind of like growing up around certain parts in the world that are considered slums; being that kid who isn't necessarily in the bad crowd, but grew up aware of it. Having to make smart decisions whether or not to get involved in certain things, as he gets older, versus watching his youngest siblings growing up living an entirely different life than how he was growing up. As my parents moved up in society, they became smarter and knew what and what not to do. I think sometimes I feel as if I was an experiment, along with my two older twin brothers [because I'm the third oldest]; like, raising us in the 90's. I think my music reflects that eternal feeling.\n\n<strong>How did you get involved in music?\n</strong>\nI've always been involved in music; it runs in my family, my Grandmother (rest in peace) taught us when we were very young to love music.\n\n<strong>Who/what were some of your influences?\n</strong>\nMy father, ( a singer ) Eminem, Notorious BIG, Pac, Kanye West, Afrika Bambaataa, Caz, Dr. Dre, Ice Cube, Nas, Jay-z, Lil Wayne; OG' emcees were P.I's (positive influences) in my life--and currently, a few newer artists, too. But, honestly there are too many artists for me to name, I mean there are all genre's that have influenced my perception of music. Michael Jackson, Bob Seager, Nirvana, Lupe Fiasco, The Pharcyde...the list goes on. So many Artist have affected change in the music industry, that it's hard to just narrow it down to two or three for me.\n\n<strong>What are you currently working on?\n</strong>\n\"26\"--possibly my first album--and more mix tapes for the people.\n\n<strong>What have been some of your biggest achievements thus far?\n</strong>\nI think the fans, and support from my followers is the biggest achievement I have thus far. The loyalty they show towards me and my music is nothing like I've ever experienced before; I never want to let them down.\n\n<strong>What are your goals in the industry?\n</strong>\nMake the best possible music that I can, and inspire the next generation to do the same, but better.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L37hdUhL0NM",

    "content_html": "[dropcap]E[/dropcap]sZ—also known as Erron—is a rapper and visual artist from New York City that has been featured here on AAHH hip-hop; albeit it's a been a while since we've heard from him. We were excited to get some new music from him. \"Theory No. 9\" is interesting for a few reasons; first of all, the title of the song suggests that it may not be factual. Secondly, the sheer concept (song and video) follows the protagonist—assuming he's speaking as himself—as he's seemingly talking to a love interest. An audio text message of sorts. That's a side story, though. He's developed a dependency to pills, which was picked up after an accident, which led to a heap of setbacks with which he—as an artist—is coping with; \"art helps heal what the pills just won't.\"\n\nAs always with Erron, the quality and uniqueness are there—and the story element pulls you in. Check out the record below, and if you're feeling, knock on the share button.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/qWMKeCwjWDE",

    "content_html": "<blockquote>“I'm on a mission. I'm Obsessed with making records I'm genuinely proud of!”\n— Lexisugar</blockquote>\n\nNigerian-born LexiSugar has made quite a name for himself, establishing a presence creating sounds for artists, movies and TV shows--and, running the gambit: from recording and audio engineering to performing and musical consulting. Some of his clients include renowned artists like Falz, Seyi Shay, Tiwa Savage, Atemi, and much more.  Under his own imprint, he recently released his new single \"How I Feel\" featuring award-winning Cameroon songstress, Tnayah who has a healthy catalog of noteworthy records, including her debut album,  LVLS which buzzed the Cameroonian radio waves all year long. To call this song a potential hit is an understatement. With a reggae vibe, a bluesy melody, and the playful combination of Lexi and Tnayah vocals on the chorus, this song feels like a musical manifestation of whispering game in the ear of a sexy lady while grinding the night away under the stars after a few too many rum punches. It's a soulful vibe that hits with the same type of impact as Sean Paul's \"<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AQ4TW5Z8eu0\">I'm Still In Love With You</a>.\"\n\n\"How I Feel\" is a soulful expression of love, explains Lexi to AAHH.  \nThe track is off of Lexisugar’s debut project set for release this May. His love for jazz, r&b, and soul music is a reflection in all of his work--in fact, a trip through his discography is highly recommended. It's a hearty blend of contemporary adult contemporary, jazz, and straight up world music that you'll probably get obsessed with; I'd recommend \"<a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/lexisugar/storyteller\">Story Teller</a>,\" \"<a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/lexisugar/hameed-lexisugar-tnayah-reach-the-stars\">Reach The Stars</a>,\" and \"<a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/lexisugar/orejesu\">Ore Jesu</a>,\" all available on his Soundcloud (all with varying capacities).\n\nI digress, though. \"How I Feel\" is the record of the moment and more than worth a spot on whatever playlist you have in place this week. DJs, take note.\n\n\nhttps://soundcloud.com/lexisugar/how-i-feel",

Dr. Dre's Detox, for example, has been playfully teased for years, with many claiming to have heard various iterations of the album. There was also the lost original version of Method Man's debut album, or the long-lost Jay-Z diss record towards Tupac. You can find more examples that I've run down, here.\n\nOne of the most anticipated in recent years, though, has been the long-promised [ROC NATION] debut album from Jay Electronica; a collection of music that he jokingly teased on the \"Exhibit C\" when he name dropped the legends in the game blowing up his phone looking for the album. Well, this past weekend at the TidalxNOLA NBA All-Star Weekend event, Jay-Z uttered something the drove fans insane, “put the album out.\"\n\nThis carrot has been dangled in front of us before over the years—most recently in July when fans were told to look for it in 40 days. The question is, though, will it truly live up to the hype? Although fans seem to have moved on from Jay's movement, it's occurrences like this that remind us how geeked we are to one day take in the fabled project.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/a-J_7ua-YGc\n\nhttps://youtu.be/gi4Gd-_Qcm8",

More recently, young upstart NBA YoungBoy has become one of the most promising rappers in the game, further thrusting the region into the spotlight. The city is bursting with talent, though; notably, 27-year-old Jay627 is an artist who is out to not only make a name for himself but put his city onto a different lane.\n\n\"My sound is different,\" he says humbly. \"I'm trying to separate myself from the rest by creating music with more live instruments—giving it a more authentic feel.\" It's an organic strategy for the young Emcee, as members of his family are musicians; two of his uncles were honoured within the Louisiana Blues Hall of Fame--so music is quite literally in his blood. His influences range from the militant/revolutionary voice of Tupac Shakur, super-producer and Cash Money Records catalyst Mannie Fresh, to Stevie Ray Vaughn and the Gap Band; his eclectic tastes are apparent in his music.\n\nTo date, Jay627 has released numerous mixtapes--his latest being 7 and the follow-up, 7 chapter 2 [both available on DatPiff. Currently, he's busy working on a new album, but stresses that he's in no rush. \"I'm taking my time so that I get the correct sound; it will be announced soon, though.\" The two singles, \"Stairway Part 2\" and \"Poor Nigga Blues\" are illustrative of the attention to detail that will ultimately carry through the entire project, which is--as of now--untitled.\n\n\"My goals in the industry are to spread my music worldwide; create music for all, expand my creativity, and hopefully land a major deal,\" says Jay with a smile. \"I feel like the world is tired of hip hop with trends: one person makes one style of song, and the rest follow. I'm trying to stand out and be different.\" With a hunger that's unreal and a strong support system behind him, Jay627 emerges as an artist to keep on top of your watch list.\n\nCheck out the newest single, \"Stairway Part 2,\" below.\n\nhttps://soundcloud.com/sixtwoseven/lil-627-ft-jailynn-stairway",

However, as I wrote the song, I began to think about all the children suffering all over the world and the cries for help we see and scroll past on our timelines so frequently,” shares DAP. “The concurrent Syrian refugee crisis and the daily reminder of the extreme poverty that cripples the lives of children in my hometown Lagos, Nigeria only reinforced the importance of the song.

I started rapping back in high school at lunch tables, doing talent shows until my brother Marc, heard me rap a 16 to him & he was impressed by the creative wordplay. He then soon began to push me into working on a small project just rapping over old school Brooklyn beats & we decided to call it \"I Love Brooklyn\" At the time I still was in high school, and there was a lot of procrastination occurring, and I wasn't as focused. Four years later I got back into being serious and finished up the project and now will be releasing it in February 2017.\"\n\nCheck out visual below\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mICZWb_1LFE",

    "content_html": "<blockquote>\"the culture needed this...We probably inspired a hundred thousand producers tonight.\"--Swizz Beats</blockquote>\n[dropcap]H[/dropcap]ip-hop has always been marked by 'special moments' throughout its timeline; for example, when BDP performed South Bronx for the first time, or when KRS-ONE threw PM Dawn off of a stage. How about when Kool Moe Dee massacred Busy Bee or the fabled battle between Jay-Z and DMX? Those are classic examples, but I mention them because they were pre-youtube, so there is no visual documentation—crowds just carried it with them.\n\n2017 is entirely different; everything is documented, so special moments seem to pop-up every other day, making them infinitely 'less special.' That doesn't mean, though, that they don't truly happen. I would consider that feeling you had from reading the first edition of the XXL Freshman Class (that featured Saigon, Plies, Rich Boy, Gorilla Zoe, Joell Ortiz, Lupe Fiasco, Lil Boosie, Crooked I, Papoose, and Young Dro) was a 'special moment.' As well, the first BET Cypher, which included Papoose, Styles P, and Lupe Fiasco, was another one. The problem is, as time goes by that initial innovative 'special moment' or catalyst gets replicated, watered down, and stagnant. It's a fact—repition leads to ruts.\n\nThis past Saturday, I—along with hundreds of thousands of other—got to experience something new, lighting a flame that maybe some of us hadn't felt in a long time. Swizz Beats and Just Blaze, arguably two of the most influential producers of the past two decades, took to Instagram to announce a live beat battle, which they delivered on Saturday. It was streamed live on YouTube by Hot 97, and via Ebro's phone on Instagram.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVqkvdAdy4M\n\nWhat transpired over two and a half hours was a back and forth battle, where each producer played (in various ways) their biggest hits; however, they had two completely different approaches. Just Blaze did a lot of chops, playing with his old samples. One highlight was when he replayed the \"Oh Boy\" sample, much to everyone's delight. Swizz was more about just dropping hits--and chopping up essential parts. The best example is when he was cutting up \"It's Me Bitches\" while grabbing his crotch. Classic.\n\nFrom Just Blaze interrupting Swizz at one point, prompting a lighthearted altercation, to Busta Rhymes popping up and making a now infamous batch of faces--the battle was a blast to watch; however, even though no winner was officially crowned, Swizz was Twitter's pick. Mostly because he dropped an epic unreleased record with Nas, Jay-Z, and DMX—prompting those watching to lose their shit. Busta's face said it all [*laughs].\n\nhttps://youtu.be/cLK2Du8zSxs?t=25m31s\n\nJust noted that after the announcement had been made about the battle, he was approached by many sources who had hoped to add a commercial spin to the event—they resisted. But, for how long? How long until this incredible idea gets taken to the maximum, pairing up every producer imaginable? Well, for now, it's contained. If Twitter has its way, it looks as though we may see Pharell take on Timbaland.\n\nTime will tell how this format will inevitably morph—and rest assured, it will. Sponsors will get involved; it will get watered down, forced, lame. Like so many moments, though, this battle is one that will go down in history; two titans who used a free platform to do something nobody [of their caliber] had yet to attempt. Swizz beats said it best at the end of the battle, \"the culture needed this. We probably inspired a hundred thousand producers tonight--they will run with this creativity. \"\n\nOne word, classic.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=84_DWMdIGxE",

Coming out of South Florida, his first official release <i>Rookie Debut</i> is a collection of songs with a ton of personality; there's a little of everything here, which creates a healthy balanced listen and builds a solid first impression.\n\nOver the ten tracks, which includes an unnecessary \"Panda\" remix, traverses topics that range from working hard to achieve his dreams, traversing the dangers of his environment, dealing with a bunky—seemingly overbearing—relationship. Most notably he faces down the important topic of police violence in the first single off of the project, \"Terrance Tamir Bland.\" On the aforementioned record, he takes two perspectives, a witness speaking from a place of outrage and a victim speaking directly to the shooter. \n\nOther standout records are \"Melisa,\" a record that takes a hindsight perspective on a lost relationship, and the piano-driven \"Don't Play\" that has a ton of potential. The super smooth \"Elevator Music\" is a crown jewel, though. The syrupy-southern sound bed gives a perfect lens to use his ultra-descriptive style to drop a stack of introspective bars like, \"you don't make it where I'm from with bad intentions.\"\n\nSnypes had a rough upbringing, and the music was his coping mechanism; this project is a fantastic introduction to what he's all about.

    "content_html": "[dropcap]T[/dropcap]here's one thing to love and admire the golden era and draw influence from it while incorporating it into contemporary sounds, and then there's having lived it—and building/adding to a sound that never truly died. Enter Ras Beats, a producer who's making some of the hottest underground New York flavors out right now; he's just getting started.\n\nHe has a track record of dropping some super flame singles on his imprint, but 2016's <i>Control Your Own</i> is his first full-body of work, and it features an impressive cast of rappers, including Elzhi, Roc Marciano, Masta Ace, Sadat X, and more.\n\nRas had a <a href=\"http://aboveaveragehiphop.com/ras-beats-interview/\">Q&A with AAHH </a>last year when the project dropped but linked up with is again recently to chat about his past, his motivation, and what's next. Check out the interview below, and if you've been sleeping on <i>Control Your Own</i>—[*slap]—wake up!\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgNPGrZkkjE\n\n<b>Your music is very nineties hip hop. Have you been doing it since that era?</b>\n\nYep, I have. I spit out the first record on my label in 2003, and I was at it before that. I was doing stuff in the nineties. It's a tradition I follow, but I always tell people, I try to add on to it, make something new out of something that came before what I do, so that's it. Yeah, I've been doing it for a minute.\n\n<b>What keeps you motivated? Because you're completely not following the wave at all—what makes you go that route, and keep it so traditional?</b>\n\nMaking music to me, it just comes organically. A lot of times, I'm listening to a record, and all of a sudden, I'm like, 'yeah, I'm going to start messing with this right now.' I kind of just go by stuff that I would like to hear. To me, there are trends that come and go, but I've figured out what I think I'm good at, so I try to keep working on that, keep getting better at what I do, and not worry about trends. Trends come and go, so I feel like there's going to be a time the grittier production style might be a little more in fashion than it is right now. I'm just doing what I do, and sticking to what I think I'm good at, and really working on that part of the craft.\n\n<b>Do you see a shift in the industry more towards your style? Because I do, in a way. There's a lot of younger artists coming in that are jumping on it.</b>\n\nYeah, to me, it's like with listening to music--from doing production to digging--I listen to all kinds of shit. I'm wide open. I listen to anything, and if I feel it, I feel it. But with hip hop, I like different styles, but I like it to have a little bit of grit and be authentic to whoever makes it. If you're an MC or a producer, and you just follow what everybody else is doing, you might still make some good stuff, but a lot of times you don't, because you're just doing a carbon copy of what everybody else is doing. Sometimes it comes to a point that people are like, I want to hear some stuff that's <em>you</em>. I think that's what happened with Alicia Keys, just to switch to another style of music. Artists like that, people were starving for somebody who wrote her own songs, played the piano, sung her heart out, so it was lacking that authenticity. So, I think that style in most of my production has been around, but definitely getting more attention now than it has in the last couple years for sure. I definitely agree with you on that.\n\n<b>What have been some of your highlights so far? </b>\n\nPersonally, the highlight for me was the album. It's the biggest piece of work that I put together myself, and I took my time with it. Before that, there was a single I actually put on the album as well with Master Ace and Sadat X, that was a big highlight for me.. A couple of lesser known records that I put out on my label as well that just meant a lot to me personally, but definitely the album so far. Most definitely. Not even close, that's the biggest piece of music for sure.\n\n<b>What are some of the other things that you're putting out on your label? Do you have artists on your label?</b>\n\nYeah. There's a guy on <em>Control Your Own</em> named JBiz who was on two tracks; the first record I put out with him, was a song called \"Ninety Five\" that we put out in 2003, which did well. That was the strictly vinyl era, so we made some noise with it back then. That was a dope thing, and goes back quite a bit. That was the first thing we put out. I put out an EP also in 2006 that was vinyl, and we did some digital with it. That was five songs, and JBiz was actually on it too. I did a song too with Neek The Exotic who's down with Large Professor and stuff a couple years ago, and that was pretty dope. That was on his previous album, too. And then I've done a lot of under the radar stuff, so I'm trying to be on the radar these days. That's what I'm trying to do now [*laughs]. I'm trying to focus on that part.\n\n<b>So, what are some of the things you're working on now? Because the last couple times we were trying to connect you were in the studio. What do you have in the pipeline?</b>\n\nI'm in the early phase of the next project--it's going to be me and one MC. I'm almost ready to let it out of the bag, but I'm still keeping it under wraps because I don't want to say anything until it's official. Also, I've been doing a lot of stuff for different people—a joint here, a joint there—and some of that should start coming out in like March and April!\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeT2T0iSCIU\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zx2mGlw-5Mc",

    "content_html": "<blockquote>\"Pac was (one of) the greatest voices of <i>MY</i> generation, but that doesn't make him the greatest voice of every generation ever.\"</blockquote>\nWhen Tupac passed away in Las Vegas after being shot [again], young Brooklynite Jo-Vaughn Virginie Scott (whom I share a birthday with) was either learning to walk, making a mess, or giving his mother the business as she tried to feed him. This—of course—is because the young rapper, known as Joey Badass, was still under two years old. This week, he was grossly misunderstood when he proclaimed (amidst some omitted context) that he could flame Tupac Shakur in a bar for bar bout. Old heads went in on the \"Devastated\" rapper, naturally; however, I think the blowback has been slightly unwarranted—here's why.\n\nFirst, we need to note that this isn't an ignorance thing; unlike other younger artists like <a href=\"https://youtu.be/qb6YM2-cIbE\">Yachty</a>, Joey knows Pac's music. Very well, actually. He's been on record as calling him an inspiration. He even did so in the same interview that many didn't bother actually to watch. As Joey explained, \"they set the bar.\" This bar was studied, and the young rapper feels as though he's able to—on a strict bar for bar level—surpass it. So what's wrong with that? Nothing. The problem is with <i>you</i>.\n\nThe next generation is destined to smash the one that precedes it. Also, hip-hop is a competitive arena, where aiming to be better comes with the territory. It's unfair to use the grandeur of Pac's legacy as a whole to try and discredit a youngster only five-odd years into his career—and with a wicked amount of accolades and co-signs. Again, Joey isn't an average mumble rapper. He's a lyricist whose done more for the underground true-school, backpack wearing, 90s-centric New York hip-hop scene than many rappers have done in a LONG time. That's the reason that <a href=\"https://youtu.be/8P5dArHvHPM\">major figures like Premier were so eager to work with him early on</a>. He not imitating, he's organically building upon.\n\nAlso, to his credit, he didn't live through Pac's era—meaning he never caught the revolutionary aura of his 'alive' charisma. But he still understands it; pretty commendable. Listen, Pac was an amazing individual who at 25-26 changed the world [even if just a little]. But we're not talking about anything else except bars; could Joey flame him in a battle? Maybe. It's not a clear-cut win, by any means.\n\nWe'll never truly know because Pac isn't here, but we need to stop holding onto Biggie and Pac being 'the greatest artists of all time, period, end of story.' It's holding a lot of people back from experiencing some great music, and polarizing young listeners from old listeners. Joey thinks he can flame his idols—and maybe he can.\n\nHe's not the first to claim such, and won't be the last. <a href=\"https://youtu.be/P-bZWMZgSN0\">LL Cool J shit on Kool Moe Dee</a>, <a href=\"https://youtu.be/z63cQKWlDgQ\">Canibus shit on LL</a>, and <a href=\"https://youtu.be/41qC3w3UUkU\">Pac shit on everyone</a>. That's what hip-hop is! Just...open your mind. Pac was (one of) the greatest voices of <i>MY</i> generation, but that doesn't make him the greatest voice of every generation ever. Let the new generation find their own Pac without us telling them to stop looking. With all due respect; Pac will never be replaced—no need to rush to his defense. His legacy is solidified. Hip-hop is growing, grow with it.\n\nJoey's new album is dropping within a month—support good old fashioned New York hip-hop; it still exists, just so you know!",

    "excerpt": null,
    "content_html": "[dropcap]W[/dropcap]e <a href=\"http://aboveaveragehiphop.com/vas-leon-is-beyond-active-going-into-2017/\">shared a record with you late last year by a London artist by the name of Vas Leon</a>. What's unique about him is that unlike some of the overseas hype we feature here on the site, Vas has strong ties out here, as a member of the Miami-based collective GTPS. He's also been [more than] about that tour life, rocking stages across the nation as well as in the UK; he even toured with the highly respected Fat Boy Slim, which gave him a ton of exposure. He dropped his album, Krossover, last September to much acclaim, landing himself on the UK Hip Hop Charts. Recently, though, he dropped a deluxe version of the project, with the addition of five new records. As I missed the train the first trip, this was an excellent opportunity to see what I've been missing out on. I pressed play, and here's what happened.\n\nOff the jump, the project--which is entire self-produced BTW--has a very epic grandeur about it. From the opening bars, \"if they tell me no, then I say why\" you get the sense that Vas is all in. This is echoed throughout all 19 tracks; it's a long listen, but it doesn't feel that way. Like a Peter Jackson film. He moonwalks through two overarching themes that steer the vibe of the project, love and proving people wrong. He kind of attacks the first idea from multiple angles, like \"The Vibe,\" which plays like a lyrical promise ring to the most important woman in his life. Then, in an almost opposite stance, he proclaims that he's still \"A Player For Life,\" but willing to change. He also takes a third-party/advisory role on the \"Problems Interlude.\"\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_19538\" align=\"alignleft\" width=\"620\"]<img src=\"http://aboveaveragehiphop.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/VAS_LEON_Album_Press_Image_1_170228011802-1.jpg\" alt=\"Vas Leon\" width=\"620\" height=\"354\" class=\"size-full wp-image-19538\" /> Vas Leon[/caption]\n\nThe new records available on this deluxe version--for the most part-- were my favorite records on the project. His literal crossover appeal is evident, and he speaks at lengths about it throughout numerous tracks, but he has bars; on the second track, \"Lyrical Slaughter,\" he describes it as having \"two minds.\" On the come up record, \"My Life,\" he drops gems like \"no homo, but this song is like a mandate,\" amidst a declaration of how he put his all into this music. My two absolute highlights, though, are the single/video, \"I'm Reborn,\" which is a theme song of a grinder/dreamer, and \"Away,\" a relatable record about a lost love that he still can't quite come to terms with.\n\nOverall, the record is an incredibly strong effort--and that's without the deluxe version songs. All the hype I've heard/seen seems to have been justified. Krossover does a great job of taking UK grime/aesthetic and making it universally relatable and digestible. If you've been sleeping, wake up!\n\n<iframe style=\"border: 0; width: 100%; height: 472px;\" src=\"https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=3955006823/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/artwork=small/transparent=true/\" seamless><a href=\"http://vasleon.bandcamp.com/album/krossover-deluxe-edition\">KROSSOVER [Deluxe Edition] by VAS LEON</a></iframe>",

    "content_html": "[dropcap]I[/dropcap]t's hard to fathom that today marks the 20th anniversary of Christopher Wallace's death. I barely batted an eye when his debut turned 10, and then a decade later, 20. But somehow, him having not touched a microphone for over two-decades seems baffling. Especially, since the uttering of his name in any disparaging tone is STILL met with unanimous opposition—his influence is still that strong. Unlike a figure like 2Pac, who worked at a feverish pitch that almost suggests he knew his timeline was about to be cut short, Biggie left us with what he left us with, short of some demo and original versions that have since been unearthed, chopped and repurposed to the maximum.\n\nHis death seems like another lifetime ago. I remember in grade eight; I had a friend who loved Biggie so much that we had to ditch and walk to his home to make sure he was ok after we heard the news of his passing—he wasn't. No hip-hop fan was. No matter how you choose to believe his death was orchestrated, it's hard not to imagine how a simple change in the ripple of fabric may have changed the rap game. Would Cease be more respected? Would 'The Commission' have become the most notable group in history? Would Charlie Baltimore be super popping? Would Cam'Ron have signed to Biggie? Would Puff have been so successful as a solo artist?\n\nHis legacy, though, is undisputed—and timeless. Artists with double, triple, and quadruple the artist's catalog are unable to come close to matching the aura, respect, and coastal influence that Biggie held. He—and the Bad Boy Family—helped shape the blueprint of what gritty New York (and worldwide) 'street' hip-hop should be, and how a successful crossover situation, while remaining street, should resemble.\n\nWhether he's the greatest rapper of all time is an argument that has no merit anymore—he's beyond that. It's like arguing whether Shakespeare is the greatest writer of all time, or Leonardo DiVinci the best painter, or Michael Jordan the best baller. All those examples illustrate individuals who—just as a philosophical concept alone—are bigger than the medium they practice. While not the most endearing rags to riches story ever (50 Cent's may best his), his was a relatable hustler's dream. Ashy to classy.\n\nToday, we pay our respect to the Notorious B.I.G and give a special shout out to Brooklyn. If you don't know, now you know. Pour out a little liquor [*Tupac voice].\n\nSee \"<a href=\"http://aboveaveragehiphop.com/what-if-we-imagine-possible-2016-biggie-collabos/\"><em>What If</em> Biggie Collbos</a>\"\n\n<iframe src=\"https://www.audiomack.com/embed4-album/aboveaveragehh/what-if-biggie-collabo-mash-up-verses\" scrolling=\"no\" width=\"100%\" height=\"350\" scrollbars=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe>",

    "content_html": "<strong></strong>[dropcap]A[/dropcap]ustin, Texas, based Kynard was a new name to me—but a great find. He has a cool mixture of vibes about him, mainly a Midwest 90s aesthetic sprinkled with that NYC lyricism. He led off with two impressive visuals, which introduced the LP <em>Get Thru The Day</em>, a well-curated gem that's ten shots (seven songs and three interludes).\n\nThe project is just as organized and well structured as it is fractured thematically. It's separated into three \"acts\" if you will, which are separated by interludes that aim to change the tone. The first act begins with the 'rap-hustler-made it' song \"Yeah I Know,\" with it's slow, hypnotic beat and repetitive chant. That's followed up by \"Weekend,\" which without question is the most easy-going record on the project, alluding to drinking, having a cookout—weekend shit.\n\nFor me, the project takes the most critical turn here for what I'll call act two, which focuses more on social issues, self-reflection, and that everyday relatable points that make this project so relevant and compelling. The piano-driven \"Get Thru The Day\" stands as the anthem for the everyday man trying to get through the day as an African American fed up with the overbearing amount of shit that [many of us] of us are faced with. \"Friend or Foe\" is beautiful—to put it mildly. It loosely explores the paranoid mentality of social inequality and injustice that many are feeling throughout the US these days.\n\nThe final act contains tracks for the ladies—kind of. \"Conversations with Bae\" is relatable as hell, but still squarely focused on vocalizing to the females in the crowd.\n\nOn the whole, the project sees Kynard dipping through a few lanes without slowing his speed—except maybe \"Weekend\" which felt disjointed after I was done with the complete project. Solid straight through listening with some replay value, especially 'act 2.'

    "content_html": "<blockquote>\"What music did for me, I want to share that with people.\"\n--Vita</blockquote>\n[dropcap]Y[/dropcap]onkers, New York, native Vita is one of the reasons I love writing about music; I love coming across new music from passionate artists with a story to tell. After <a href=\"http://aboveaveragehiphop.com/singer-crush-nycs-own-vita-has-it/\">being presented with her song \"Can't Turn Away\"</a> for the potential inclusion on our humble site, I did some digging and found--nothing. The song was so dope, though. I had to learn more about the soulful voice behind it, so I got in contact, and she graciously sat with AAHH for an interview.\n\nGet to know the super talented up and coming singer--and the motivation behind her music--in her interview below.\n\nhttps://soundcloud.com/vita-got-soul/cant-turn-away\n\n<strong>How did you got involved in music?\n</strong>\nWell, there are videos of me—going back to when I was just little—and I was always praised for singing. I always liked it but was told that it wasn't practical to want to be a singer, so I never took it seriously until I went through stuff later on in life. I realized being a lawyer is just as hard [as pursuing music] but if it's what I want to do, you have to go for it. It's been a long ride.\n\n<strong>What has been some of the feedback you've gotten from this new song?\n</strong>\nThis one, I've been getting a lot of good feedback; people seem to be connecting to it on a real level. Every song I make, I want to be able to take you to a place and be able to have you listen and relate. I've gotten more love than I would ever have imagined, honestly. I only have a couple of songs out, but that's because I wanted to put out the best possible stuff, and I've been writing material for a long time. I'm working on a lot of things, but this was finally something that I was ready to drop. I want people to sit and listen to this story that I'm about to tell.\n\n<strong>You mentioned a project, and that was my next question. So, what's this all leading up to?\n</strong>\nThis [upcomng] project is going to be titled <em>Aftermath</em>; I have a plan for my entire discography. I mean, I'm sure that there will be other projects along the way, but right now I'm also working on the next project that's way under wraps. It's been in the works for a while—so, everything is going backward in my timeline, hopefully leading up to an album that's about me growing up. I just need to introduce myself. I wanted to put out something that people could relate to, like the Aftermath of a relationship. That's the idea behind this project, so it's just like me going through the motions afterward. It's going to be a little EP; I'm going to say like four, five, maybe six songs. That's in the works right now.\n\n<strong>That's a good strategy. Kanye did the same thing. He planned out his entire discography like from day one.\n</strong>\nYeah. I've seen Kendrick talk about it doing that, too. I want to fully explore me experiencing love for the first time, going through a real break up, and real losses—after the fact; really, the elements that built me into the person I am today. But, I want everybody to get pieces of me before that. Everybody needs something to relate to at the end of the day. Every artist I love, I love them because I can relate to them. I think you just evolve as a person, and we go through our moods and our phases and everything; each project is going to be one phase.\n\n<strong>Ok, so Aftermath is first, what's the second 'phase'?\n</strong>\nThe one following <em>Aftermath </em>is going to be <em>The Ride</em>, which was the relationship, and just showing how being young and in a relationship is like fighting; being the person, you're supposed to become, or subjecting yourself to your muse and just letting yourself get all wrapped in that.\n\n<strong>I'm digging the master plan of it all...\n</strong>\nI'm into the whole longevity of it. I'm not trying to push myself to make a million songs, and have some be trash. I want people to hear what I have to say, but I want it to be quality. I want it to be something you could listen to over and over again,even if it's something, I just throw out there.\n\n<strong>Absolutely. And I mean if you can do that, your fans will be way more focused. You'll have some real fans that will grow with you.</strong>\n\nRight. Like, hopefully, there is a time when I'm throwing out music like that. Like when the studio setup is correct, when I'm in the studio everyday. When I'm just on a roll because artists go through that, I have gone through that. If I would just release my voice memos, it would be interesting, but it's not like everything is solid.\n\n<strong>I reached out because I wanted to get more info on you—but, was having trouble finding content.\n</strong>\nI've done interviews with underground radio stations—and more low-key outlets. But, I [do] love to tell the story behind my music, because what music did for me, I want to share that with people. I knew that the time would come when I'd be able to tell it.\n\n<strong>So what was the biggest motivating factor for you wanting to [now] push so hard?\n</strong>\nOne of the more significant reasons why I want people to know my name is because of my father. He was just a real fucking person—and he went through a lot. He did everything for his family. As a kid, he never talked to me like I was just a kid; he always valued that I am a person. He taught me that even though I'm a woman, I could be tough and achieve anything. I want to sing his story. Because when you leave, you don't realize there might not be anything to be said about you, and that would be a shame if his story weren't heard, so I partly do this to keep his name on. I came from a dark place, and I know that it would kill him to see me in a dark place.\n\n<strong>I mean, the power of it too is, there might be a lot of other people that feel the same way, or are in a similar situation.\n</strong>\nRight, and not even that. I remember the music I was listening to when he passed away; I guess that's why I relate to hip hop. I grew up in Yonkers, and I had a great upbringing. My family never really struggled, and if they did, they didn't let me know about it, you know what I mean? I don't know, I just feel like I'm not the typical story, and even though I'm from the suburbs, I'm sitting here listening to Biggie and feeling something. I just always connected with music, and I always appreciated hearing things I needed to hear. You ever have like a song that comes on, and you're like, 'shit, I needed to hear that today?' That's what I want my music to do. Whether it's a good vibe, or it's some real emotional shit, I just want people to feel like, 'I needed that.'\n\n<strong>At the end of the day, ultimately, what's your goal?\n</strong>\nI want to one day be touring and have people want to know all the words to my songs and look me up on genius, and things like that. I was that person waiting for that next drop, waiting for the album from somebody, just so that I could get in my car, put it on, sit back, roll a joint, smoke it, and let everything else--whatever's going on--just go away. I just want my music to be that; for some music is just something that they have on in the background, but for me, it's like my mind is constantly on it, and I mark my memories through the music. So, if someone can mark their memories with my music, I'd be a happy person.\n\nhttps://soundcloud.com/vita-got-soul/tangible",

Check out the brief interview below, and stay tuned for the new project dropping this April.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bPkqTjI06qo\n\n<strong>Tell me about your sound, what are your influences?\n</strong>\nMy sound is universal and vintage; I got introduced to music at age 13. The first person that introduced me to music was my older cousin. Since then I've drawn a lot of influence from acts like 2pac, Lil' Wayne, Jay-Z, Nas, Kanye West, Coldplay and more.\n\n<strong>What are you currently working on?\n</strong>\nCurrently, I'm working on the marketing and videos for <em>The Teenager Story</em>.\n\n<strong>What would you say have been your biggest achievements thus far?\n</strong>\nIn 2010, I was featured as one of hottest artists from New Orleans on Worldstarhiphop--I rapped over a Dead Prez track, back when my stage name was DY. My record \"Love,\" which you guys featured here, reached millions of views; and, finally, I shook hands with Jay-Z during all-star weekend 2017.\n\n<strong>What are your industry goals?\n</strong>\nGoals for industry stay Humble and do things the world hasn't seen yet.\n\n<strong>What's next for you--beyond the album?\n</strong>\nMarketing, shooting videos, modeling, acting--yes, I'm going to be an actor--and just keep creating, God willing.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6xABpYV60E",

    "content_html": "Photo Credit: Teithis Miller Photography \n<blockquote>\"Style is whatever you want to do...that is, if you can do it with confidence.\" --KnowledgeΔustin</blockquote>\n18-year-old KnowledgeΔustin is unique in that while beaming with youthful exuberance, his new project feels like the beat selection was made by an artist in his thirties. The Sarasota, Florida, native—and son of a DJ—has been at it for five years now, but<em> Hip-$oul</em> is his most interesting collection of tracks, that includes a handful of original production mixed with 'dubs.' I'll double down on my original point in that the tracks he did choose to remake were ones that I'd never heard tackled, especially not by a cat his age.\n\nA few examples include \"My Mind Made Up,\" a remake of the <a href=\"https://www.google.ca/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=video&cd=1&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0ahUKEwjmirvmudvSAhVI4YMKHQejAe0QtwIIHDAA&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DnmuFK1DX9xg&usg=AFQjCNFvsP5sGiHGgsVMRdgI2yN_P8-JxA\">Daz Dillinger produced posse cut</a> off of 2Pac iconic Deathrow debut. His version, though, is made his own, with the sing-song chorus addition, sandwiched between a story of a lost relationship, and a good friend trying to get his mind off of it by pushing him to talk to some girls. Two of the strongest records are \"Changes,\" with its soulful vibe and \"70(5ive)\" with it's seductive down south bass and chunky guitar riffs. The latter is the most standalone vibe on the project.\n\nThe (too) short \"OTP is a highlight should you at all question is 'hip-hop,' with bars like \"Blasting Illmatic out of a 2000 Pontiac, windows down, cause the left passenger side is broke down.\"\n\nThe project's title is aptly explained in an interlude that likens \"Hip-$oul\" to the same feeling you get when you get that new car or score a date with the girl you thought was out pf your league; essentially, the project's entire concept is a euphemism for feeling good. It lives up to this, with its unique vibe that while not wholly original, definitely stands out in the current wave of releases. Whether talking about a drug raid on his home (\"Reminisce\"), or tackling more introspective themes, KnowledgeΔustin delivers honesty and good vibes.\n\n<iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/playlists/274469960&color=ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false\" width=\"100%\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"no\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe>",

    "content_html": "[dropcap]S[/dropcap]ocial media is crazy--and, technology ever ceases to amaze me.\n\nA few weeks ago during a routine dig from a private collection, I came across a crispy copy of Rob Swift's <em>Ablist </em>on vinyl. Rob was one-fourth of the iconic DJ collective known as the X-Men, alongside the late Roc Raida, Mista Sinista, and Total Eclipse. Rob later departed the group in 2004 for a multitude of reasons, and since then has added six projects to an already notable discography that spans 20 years, appeared on TV and in film, and traveled the world—among other things.\n\nHis latest role is a Professor in NYC, teaching a new generation the art of turntablism, which is like having Kobe showing you how to take jump shots. From being Akinyele's DJ during the <i>Vagina Diner</i> era to working with the Blueman Group, to say Rob has taken cutting and scratching to new heights would be...an understatement.\n\nRounding back to my opening statement, social media <em>is </em>crazy, because while sharing my find [<em>Ablist</em>] on the gram, I inadvertently found myself trading messages with Rob, a DJ I'd admired for over 20 years.\n\nHe took some time to answer a few questions for AAHH—you can check out the interview below.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GSc7WAgl2uk\n\n<strong>AAHH: Do you remember what your first record was?\n</strong>\nDJ Rob Swift: Of course I remember. That's a memory that will never leave me. I was in the 6th grade the first time I went to a record store by myself and brought \"Roxanne, Roxanne\" by UTFO. The scratches on that record (*Big up Mix Master Ice) changed my life.\n\n<strong>AAHH: How did you originally connect with the X-Men?\n</strong>\nDJ Rob Swift: My mentor, Dr. Butcher, introduced me to Steve Dee (co-founder of the X-Men) at my first battle, the 1991 East Coast DMC regional. Dr. Butcher and Steve Dee had already met prior today day and Butcher, knowing I was a big fan of Steve's introduced me. Steve ended up inviting us to his place for a practice session couple of weeks later. That was the day he asked us to join the X-Men.\n\n<strong>AAHH: What was the final catalyst for you venturing off into solo ventures?\n</strong>\nDJ Rob Swift: I needed an outlet for a lot my creative ideas. As a member of the X-Ecutioners, I felt as though I had to compromise many of the directions I wanted to take with this art for the sake of fitting into the group's framework for what they wanted to accomplish. As a solo artist, I didn't have to negotiate my creativity. I just experimented the way I wanted.\n\n<strong>AAHH: You've been in the game for years—what keeps you hungry?\n</strong>\nDJ Rob Swift: It's not a matter of staying hungry. I just love what I do.\n\n<strong>AAHH: We know you did cuts for Akinyele on his classic debut, Fat Joe's debut, and even worked with the Blue Man Group. Are there any crazy credits that maybe people don't know about?\n</strong>\nDJ Rob Swift: Too many to mention man. I've recorded scratches for Chi Ali, did remixes for the Red Hot Chili Peppers. I'd keep you here for way too long if I kept going.\n\n<strong>AAHH: How did you get into teaching?\n</strong>\nDJ Rob Swift: I've always been teaching this art. Even when I was young and up and coming, friends would come to my parent's home, watch me practice, then ask If I could teach them how I was doing what I was doing. So it makes sense that as an established DJ today, I'm still teaching this art at schools, universities and through my social media posts. Big up to The New School University for Liberal Arts in NYC. They've given me the perfect platform to further this amazing art of Djing.\n\n<strong>AAHH: Why do you think it's important for your students to learn the fundamentals of the art?\n</strong>\nDJ Rob Swift: A building needs a strong foundation. That's why!\n\n<strong>AAHH: Do feel as though technology has diluted the artform?\n</strong>\nDJ Rob Swift: Definitely. Technology has made it too easy to accomplish many of the techniques DJs like myself practiced years to develop. As a result, it's made DJs lazy, and they overlook the little things, like rhythm and timing.\n\n<strong>AAHH: Are you working on any projects currently?\n</strong>\nDJ Rob Swift: I'm always working on something. I'm not at liberty to say what, though.\n\n<strong>AAHH: What was the biggest learning you've had from all your years on the decks?\n</strong>\nDJ Rob Swift: I've had many. The biggest I'd say would have to be that through creativity on turntables I've learned how to center myself and better connect with my real potential. Creativity is a gift from God. A gift that makes it, so you achieve oneness with the part of you that is God.\n\n<strong>AAHH: What advice do you have for up and coming DJ's who are trying to find themselves (artistically)?\n</strong>\nDJ Rob Swift: Express yourself honestly. Bruce Lee taught me that.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-q8pGWdNEE",

    "content_html": "<blockquote>\"[I am] excited to show the world a clear look into my life.\" —Legend</blockquote>\n[dropcap]I[/dropcap]llinois rapper Legend—the face of Oso Major Entertainment—has dropped more than one banging loosies over the past quarter; this week, though, he hit us off with a more substantial helping of freshness. <em>Free Juice</em>, a focused seven-song freebie has a little of everything, but above all, it's a healthy dose of bars and fire production.\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Legend swerves into a few lanes as the filler-less project progresses. He Kicks off with a 'freestyle' of sorts on 2Pac's classic \"Mind Made Up\" off of his multi-platinum-selling <em>All Eyez On Me</em>, which happens to be the first CD Legend ever purchased. He sets the tone with a barrage of impressive wordplay, \"young Legend spit bullets every conversation.\" On \"C-O-N\" he addresses the mindset of the average trapper engulfed in a reality of slanging or starving.</p>\nHe channels a more melodic side on records like \"Please Don't Turn It Up,\" and the slow and sexy \"Guilty Pleasures,\" but he doesn't let the vibe ever settle. With records like the almost dip-set sounding production of \"I'm Here\" and the searing, subliminal punchline fest \"Round 1\" in play, the record walks the line without ever getting soft, boring, or stale.\n\nThe record \"MIA\" is a letter to a friend locked up, and one of the standouts of the project. With it's slow, cinematic flow, Legend reminisces on the better times.\n\nFree Juice paints a picture of a hustler gone straight. Whether or not the overt street-isms are factual or just bars, it's clear that his heart ships and struggles have found a way to permeate itself into his music. With obvious mainstream hip-hop appeal, <em>Free Juice</em> is an entertaining prelude to an exciting artist who you want to keep on your watch list for 2017.\n\n<iframe src=\"https://www.audiomack.com/embed4-album/oso-major-ent/free-juice\" width=\"100%\" height=\"350\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe>",

He's done stuff for Dizzy Wright, OnCue, Demrick, Emilio Rojas, to name a few.\n\nThe record is a few things; by his own description \"a track about my life in Queens and also an ode to 50 Cent.\" The latter is obvious by the overt mentions of Fif, and the chorus' chant of \"Catch you on the late night, pop shots with the fifth then slide off in the six,\" which is a quote from \"<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UcJl6ITKzPw\">Life On The Line</a>.\"\n\nThe record also sees Aaron shrugging off any [ignorant] comparisons to other white rappers in the game. \"Not Macklemore, don't ask me that—not Mac Miller either, you'll get smacked for that.\" He likens himself closer to \"the kid from Aftermath,\" lyrically.\n\nIf you haven't been following Aaron, he's been having a nice run these past six months, with premieres on all the big dog sites, and—more impresseive—his overseas tour dates. He's across the pond now, with a headline show in Paris coming up April 7th.\n\nTake a peek at the super dope clip, directed by FRMNDS.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nb_N_6YExRE",

    "content_html": "[dropcap]E[/dropcap]very once in a while, we get a reminder that music AND organic level fan base can truly be the most valuable assets an artist can have. Not gimmicks, as often thought to be the case by 'industry' bankers. Case and point: underground [ish] rapper Hi-Rez dropped a brand new album this week, <em><a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/missing-pieces/id1205775644&app=itunes\">Missing Pieces</a></em>, which made an impressive impact on the iTunes charts, coming in at #13 on the US Hip-Hop/Rap category. As I'm writing this, it's currently #17 in Canada, nestled between Drake and Eminem, and one of only two relatively unknown acts in the Top 20. The coolest part, though, is that he did so without any co-signs, major label, commercial radio, or—for that matter—any credible press push. Just old fashioned grind and manual relationship building with fans.\n\nAs a whole the project keeps a very cohesive tone, sticking to the elements of a common narrative. 'College drop-out, dedicated himself to music, struggled through the bad times, finally got on; now that he's there, he's noticing it's harder to sift through his circle in search of genuine friendship as opposed to hands in his pockets.' Much like Kanye's debut album,<em> College Dropout</em>, this project uses that story line as the underlying basis for all the records—with great results.\n\n\nThere's a light but dope supporting cast; he's joined by Billboard charting Dizzy Wright on the \"Bitch Don't Kill My Vibe\"-esque \"Preach,\" one of the project's strongest records. Also making appearances are underrated New York spitter Emilio Rojas (\"Get Out And Get It\"), Rapper/Singer Devvon Terrell (\"I'm Up\") and BRBN on the 'let's all be cool with each other' anthem \"It's All Love.\" The rest of the records are held down by Rez, with a versatile, rapid fire, multi-syllable flow.\n\nThis project isn't his first, as he clearly articulates on the project more than once; his recent success has been the result of hard work and dedication. He's been ripping stages pretty much everywhere, and his iTunes catalog is packed with music. It's just now reached the right temperature to boil and bubble over. One of the most profound takeaways from the album comes in the form of a sound clip around two-minutes into the second song, \"Other Side.\" \"It's all about building that foundation; it's about building that fucking house before you get there,\" he says with a hint of aggression. \"A lot of these clowns race right to the top...when that wave is out nobody gives a fuck. You may have money, but you're not going to die a legend.\"\n\nAn excellent cover to cover listen; no filler, no bullshit. Give it a spin, and if you're into it, you can <a href=\"https://www.missingpiecestour.com/\">catch him on tour</a>.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wA5O_rPhjBA",

    "content_html": "[dropcap]R[/dropcap]aekwon—an original member of the iconic Wu-Tang Clan—recently dropped a new project entitled The Wild. If you follow my writing, you may have read my <a href=\"http://exclaim.ca/writers/riley_wallace\">review and interview</a>, both of which were published by Toronto's Exclaim! Magazine; in short, the album is incredible. It's the most 'grown-up' and, for lack of a better term, 'mature' project we've heard in his catalogue. It also has that raw essence that some us missed on his last project.\n\nOne of the highlight songs—to me—was the concept record \"M N\" that featured an artist I'd never heard before, P.U.R.E. In conversation with Rae, he revealed some insight into the young artist, who is not only signed to IceH20 but is described by Rae as a protégé. \"He's a dope MC that I signed, and I feel like he's going to be a problem to the world as far as being a great MC, a great artist,\" he said proudly. \"It's so important that we pass the torch to this new generation of guys coming out, and I truly believe he has what it takes.\"\n\nHe is, for all intents and purposes, a ghost online. This record, as it turns out, is his official debut. \"I wanted him on the album, and of course we wanted to do something clever, something different from any artist in the business; I just love where we went with it. I wanted him to shine on this album as well, and give him that lift that he deserves because he's going to be a problem.\"\n\nThis isn't the first time we've seen Rae usher in younger talent in a protégé position, though. Toronto's own JD Era was once go-to. However, this is different, and you can hear it in Chef's voice as he describes his high hopes for the young artist. \"This kid is super talented; he's a songwriter—he just gets busy, you know what I mean? I believed in him, [\"M N\"] was his debut, and he killed it.\n\n\"Where is he from,\" I asked him. \"He's from a secluded place that I don't want to get into yet.\" I wondered out loud if he was from Nova Scotia, as he made reference the Eastern Canadian province in the song's final verse. Raekwon laughed at my flawed detective work. \"Nah, man. And, he's not from New York. Put it like this, though—I think the mysteriousness of it, the mystique of him is what we want to keep up for now. We're going to keep it all on the low until you finally get the opportunity to feel him out. So, there's a little surprise factor going on; but, this is my protégé. I'm keeping as a top secret. All of that's going to come out sooner or later, though.\"\n\nAlthough most 90s hip-hop sidekicks failed to live up to expectations laid out—such as Lil' Cease and Bleek for example—the last five years have been a 360 shift. DOOM helped usher in Bishop Nehru from obscurity, and Nas has made Dave East a top billing contender. Who TF is P.U.R.E.? All we know for sure is that one of hip-hop's most respected acts is putting not all, but a LOT of eggs into his basket. \"He's one of the few cats from this new generation that I think is going to put out a classic record out the gate,\" Raekwon says without hesitation. This man knows a thing or two about dropping a classic debut, so I have high hopes.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/OLUTzam0qsM",

Staying isolated from other artists, Dreamcast will go on for months not listening to any mainstream album while he's working on the writing process for his projects.\n\nThere are talks of an upcoming album this year named <em>Pegasus</em>, which he only describes as \"a depressing love story,\" as well as a few tracks floating around the net. Currently, on his Youtube page you can view his visual treatment for his single \"Joyride,\" and filming has begun for his gritty smash \"Harlem Knights.\"\n\n\"Ironically, I thought only street dudes would enjoy this record, but when I perform it, I notice women paying attention too. I guess it's a record that has universal appeal? I'm going to be spending a lot of energy as a creative consultant, working on other NY artists music videos, and will be a regular comedic panelist on the Verbal Assault Talk Show,\" says Dreamcast when discussing what's up next.\n\nFor now, check out his music and get familiar.\n\n<iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https://api.soundcloud.com/users/9138475&color=ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false\" width=\"100%\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"no\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe>",

    "content_html": "[dropcap]F[/dropcap]lorida rapper Xleoniduz has made many appearances here on the site leading up to his upcoming full-length. His latest single, Versace Mansion is unexpectedly deep--we think. The record has X dropping a mix of spoken work and bars in a Quasimoto-esque modulated voice; the song describes a dreamlike mansion at great lengths. From the sound of waves to painted ceilings and incredible artwork, it sounds like the type of house you'd expect to see in a big-budget music video.\n\nExcept, the song has an oddly unnerving tone to it. Is it a dream? Is he dead, describing an idealized version of a 'street kid's heaven?' There a few clues, including mention of that fact that he saw Tupac, and that he never wanted to leave. Both lending to the fact that it's a dream of some sort. Also, it can be argued that the use of a voice that isn't his is a subtle way of detaching.\n\nAll this, though, is us looking into the record without his actual clarification. He described it as 'New Age' on his SoundClound--which is fair. It's much different than his other records thus far, and was harder to get into, but still a great tune.\n\nTake a listen.\n\nhttps://soundcloud.com/leoniduz/versace-mansion",

    "content_html": "[dropcap]N[/dropcap]orth Carolina rapper Mosca Flux is someone I stumbled upon by accident while scrolling Twitter; her pretty face and unusual name drew me in, but her bars and a clear love of the culture kept me locked. In a sea of MCs, sometimes it's hard to hold attention span, but there was obviously something there. I dug through her online presence and checked out some footage of her live show, which is dripping with energy. I decided to reach out to Mosca, who answered some questions for AAHH about being a woman in the industry, her upcoming projects and more.\n\nCheck it out, below.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_zSC9mA79o\n\n<strong>How did you get into music?</strong>\n\nI got serious about my music I'd probably say back in 2013. I started laying down my music and recording, and then I started performing locally here in North Carolina. Traveled all around North Carolina doing local shows and stuff like that. Now I am currently signed and will be traveling this weekend to Atlanta to perform, and I'll be in California come June. I'll be doing the rooftop party for the BET awards, and then at the end of June, I will be in Cleveland opening up for Remy Ma, so things are taking off. Slow process, I mean—like I said—in 2013 I got really serious about my music, but you know four years in isn't too bad to be finally starting to get that … get the look that I've wanted to get for a while now.\n\n<strong>Do you find that it's harder as a female in the industry? Maybe even just in the sphere of other female MC's?</strong>\n\nYes. Not because I'm a girl and things should be easy for us, you know what I mean? It's because we're not being taken seriously. I find myself always having to outdo what the men do even to get the credit I deserve. Then, if you're a good looking female on top of that, people are just going to look at you like 'Oh, she's pretty,' and they don't take you seriously until they hear your bars or they see you perform—and then they're impressed. I could walk in somewhere and tell them “hey I'm a rapper,” and they would not take me seriously at all, versus a man that would say hey I'm an MC, and they'd say “oh really? I'll check you out.” When I started out, people would [sometimes] try to take advantage and hit me up and say hey I want to work with you, but they have ulterior motives, or they have other bad intentions. A lot of guys are just trying to get with you; they're not trying to help your music career, so that's the other thing we run into and men don't have to deal with that, you know what I mean? Because it's a male dominated industry, so they don't have to worry about stuff like that.\n\n<strong>Some of those points are things that I didn't even think about because I'm a guy. Most guys would be like alright let me come to your studio; but, there's a lot of other things you have to think about, right?</strong>\n\nYes. Exactly, are they legit? Are they trying to help me? Now the way I operate is I say “hey you want a feature? Send me the track. I'll do it here at my studio and send it back.” If they're serious, then they'll do it. If not, they'll be like “I wanted you to come by here.” I'm not trying to hang out with you. I'm trying to do business—and business is business. That's just what it is; I'll send you the track. Send it to me first, and I'll send it back.\n\n<strong>What are you working on right now? What do you have coming up?</strong>\n\nRight now, I am working on my album. It's hopefully dropping in the Summer; it's called <em>H2O</em>. This one's going to be a little different because it's going to be a little more personal. I called it <em>H2O</em> because it's the cleansing, it's like a purge of all my real inner thoughts and inner feelings, and it's real life experiences. A lot of my music, people, don't get to hear that side of me. Most of the time, I'm entertaining people. I might give you some turn-up or something hard or something real, but this is going to be a little more personal, so that's why that's called <em>H2O</em>.\n\nBetween now and then I'm hoping to drop a mixtape. It's going to be called <em>Mosca Flux V.S. The Baroness</em>. And the Baroness is like my alter-eager, she is like that sassy, edgy Mosca Flux that probably doesn't give a f-- and says whatever flies out of her brain. That's going to be like just a series of different songs where you can tell the different personalities because I'm a Gemini so if you know anything about Geminis, we have a dual personality. I will be displaying the duality because you can hear it in my music now, but on this mixtape, I'm going to point it out so you can see the difference there.\n\n<strong>I'm really big on female MC's that aren't trying to be Remy or Nicki if that makes sense.</strong>\n\nYeah absolutely.\n\n<strong>It's kind of unfair in that you have to be Remy or Nicki to get where you want to go...</strong>\n\nWell, I just plan on finding my balance. A lot of people say when you get into the industry that you've got to sell out, you've got to do this, you've got to show your body off, all these other things; but, I grew up in the 90s. Every female MC that I saw didn't necessarily have to do that. I feel like I'm going to find that balance where I don't have to do that really, and I'm going to be respected for my music and my bars without really having to sell out in any way.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp--WTRzMc4",

    "content_html": "[dropcap]K[/dropcap]illa Kyleon remains one of the South’s most talented, crafty, hard-working and diverse artists. He's got ambitious plans for 2017, including a new album, <em>Texas Plates & Candy Paint 3</em>, which will be released this spring and includes guest appearances from Bun B, Scarface, Devin The Dude, A$AP Rocky, A$AP Ferg, Willie D, & Young Dolph among others.\n\nBefore his proper album arrives, Killa Kyleon has dopped his new EP, <em>Lorraine Motel</em>, a conceptual project that honors the legacy of historic black leaders and figures, chiefly, Dr. Martin Luther King, who was assassinated on April 4th, 1968 at the Lorraine Motel in Memphis, TN.\n\n“The <em>Lorraine Motel</em> project is directed at what's going on in today's society within the black community as a whole” Killa Kyleon states. “It’s not a one-sided commentary; it deals with the treatment people of color have been receiving from law enforcement and how we are programmed and influenced by social media, television and the culture of Hip-Hop to treat each other as well. As a race and culture, we need to stand together, but also take accountability for our actions. I feel the black American dream and ideal died when MLK was murdered in Memphis (at the Lorraine Motel). So I created this conceptual project as an analogy of today’s climate in America. We all (African Americans) died that day at the Lorraine Motel. Barack Obama is the last of one of our strongest black leaders to lead us as a race. The <em>Lorraine Motel</em> project focuses on events (both past and current) that have taken place since that fatal day.”\n\nStream the project, below.\n\n<iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/playlists/312948271&color=ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false\" width=\"100%\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"no\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe>",

    "content_html": "<blockquote>\"As an artist, if you don’t change with the music, then you’ll get left behind.\" —Bobby V</blockquote>\n[dropcap]B[/dropcap]obby Valentino rose to prominence in 2005 with his hit single \"Slow Down,\" produced by Tim & Bob. As the R&B face of Ludacris' Disturbing The Peace label, he shot to the top of Billboard charts; he went on to release six studio albums, work with every superstar in the game, dabble in reality TV, and—most recently—he appeared in the BET TV movie \"Hollywood Hearts.\" The fact that he even needs to justify to anyone that he hasn't fallen off is, no pun intended, ludicrous.\n\nThe bigger picture, though, is the overall shift in R&B music. The year he rose to prominence is important, as it's the same year that T-Pain dropped \"I'm Sprung,\" officially making auto-tune the new thing. It wasn't until Kanye picked it up for the entirety of his <em>808</em> project that rappers truly grasped that with the use of autotune, and no longer needed to seek out singers. With rappers beginning to blur the lines more and more, R&B has effectively, as Bobby describes, \"turned rap.\" As he explains, \"R&B has taken a backseat to rap and rappers. I think R&B singers have to perform and make our music and fit in with the rap; at one time rappers needed us for the hook but with autotune and everybody singing now, they don’t need us like that no more. I think that that’s one of the reasons why R&B is in the position that it is in right now.\"\n\nHe's quick, though, to acknowledge that this is nothing new. \"the game always changes. It always has, from the disco years to now. It always changes and evolves. I think that as an artist, if you don’t change with the music, then you’ll get left behind.\"\n\nhttps://youtu.be/4KUYdNUmt-c\n\nBobby has been anything but stagnant, especially with his foray into film. \"Hollywood Hearts was my introduction to acting and I’m working a new film right now. We’re in the preliminary stage of the new film. I’m excited. I’m taking a lot of acting classes. So that’s where I’m at right now on the acting side.\" He's quick to shrug off the question whether reality TV, which has become a mainstay for many peers who came up in his time bubble. \"I’ve dabbled and dabbled in it, but I haven’t really—I don’t want to be a character unless it’s a show dealing with me and my life. I don’t want to subjected to somebody making me look like a fool.\"\n\nThe most exciting news for longtime fans, though, is that he's focusing on not just music, but R&B music—in an iteration he still holds dear. \"I plan to just periodically just drop one or two songs a month throughout the year. And at the end of the year, pick the best song to go on the project that I put out.\"\n\nYou can hear his focus on the latest single, \"U Down?,\" which has been getting a lot of buzz online. \"This song right here, I just happened to put it out, and it’s doing well,\" Bobby says cheerfully. \"It’s kinda exciting for me. I’m glad that people are feeling it. I plan to take that rapper mentality and put out a lot of songs so people can see that I’m making hot records.\"\n\n15+ years later, Bobby credits his adaptability and tenacity for his ultimate success thus far. \"You have to continue to learn; you have to able to take the good and the bad. It’s a rollercoaster, and there’s a lot of ups and downs. If you keep a level head and keep the people around you always, you can succeed.\"\n\nDon't sleep on Bobby, because he's putting the genre on his back; \"I’m trying to bring R&B back. At one point I had given up on it. But know what, now I’ve just got a newfound respect for it, and now I’m back on it.\"\n\n‪‪<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"450\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/312360383&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true\"></iframe>",

    "content_html": "<blockquote>\"If you look close enough, you can always find something beautiful growing from underneath the dirt.\" --Hector Dominguez</blockquote>\n[dropcap]A[/dropcap]rtist Hector Dominguez, who hails from Chicago's Humboldt Park Community is using his platform to bring another voice to Hip Hop. \"We live in a day where everyone is talking about how many bodies they’ve dropped, how many drugs they’ve done, how many men/woman they’ve slept with—and that’s all cool,\" he says disapprovingly. \"There is obviously a lane and market for that right now, but I just wanted to bring a different voice. I want to pay homage to the great story tellers and influencial figures in the culture with everything that I do.\"\n\nIt's a noble direction for an artist from his city; although many more positive figures have emerged from the city, such as Chance The Rapper who has donated well over $3 million to the city's school board, most seem to go left. \"Music has always been therapy for me, and I wanna bring hope to my hometown.\"\n\nGet to know Hector a little better in the interview below. He tells AAHH about his sound, direction, and goals.\n\n<iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/playlists/292501585&color=ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false\" width=\"100%\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"no\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe>\n\n<strong>Tell me about the music -- describe your sound.</strong>\n\nThe only way I could describe my sound would be if Eminem and Selena Quintanilla had a baby and then went out on a date—and let Bone Thugs n Harmony babysit. It sounds weird, but my music encompasses hip hop culture, Latin culture (I’m Puerto Rican), Jazz, Trap, storytelling. Just a big mix of everything I grew up listening to.\n\n<strong>How did you get involved in music?</strong>\n\nI was real suicidal when I was younger. I had a lot of pain and anger growing up and had nowhere to go with that pain. Like a lot of people in my neighborhood, I grew up submerged in drugs, gangs, murder and violence but for some reason, I never had a desire to get involved in any of that. I knew a bunch of kids like me growing up, and many fell victim to that, and I believe it was because everyone that we looked up to was doing the same thing. I grew up knowing I wanted to make a difference and give an alternative outlet for someone who comes from what we come from.\n\n<strong>Who/what were some of your influences?</strong>\n\nMusically, some of my influences are Big Pun, Fat Joe, Bone Thugs n Harmony, Twista, Common, Kanye, Eminem, The Game, J Cole, Biggie, Nas, Pac, Lecrae; the list can go on forever.\n\n<strong>What have you released?</strong>\n\nSo to date, I have put out 3 Retail Albums with <em>MISUNDERSTOOD</em> being the most recent, but I’ve been making music since I was 16 years old. I have put out 29 mixtapes since then, and these are 12-15 song mixtapes. I used to go to class and have Limewire (STD for a computer) running on a computer downloading every instrumental I could get. I had over 1TB of beats at one time. I’m happy to say I’ve grown since then lyrically, so please no one go searching for those [*laughs].\n\n<strong>What are you currently working on?</strong>\n\nWith the political climate that we are currently in, especially being of Latin descent, I feel it is necessary to create a project along with others who some Americans feel the need to label as immigrants—and celebrate all of our cultures. I don’t have a name right now, and I’m still playing around with song ideas, but my next project for sure will be a different flavor than many may be used to.\nWhat have been some of your biggest achievements thus far?\nMy biggest achievement so far might be a little different than you might think. As a rapper, the goal is often to get the biggest shows and to record the most fire verses, and none of those things are bad things. I’ve been able to travel and make music across the country. I have done many of Chicago’s biggest radio station events as a walk on—no invitation [*laughs]. I am the first Latin rapper to do the Chicago Gospel Fest. Those are all great things that I will forever cherish, but none of that compares to marring the woman of my dreams and God blessing us with two beautiful children. I love my wife, son, and daughter more than anything else on this earth.\n\n<strong>What are your goals in the industry?</strong>\n\nI don’t want to be famous. I ain't built for that. I am not about people getting into my personal life and taking pictures of my kids and trying to sell them and make millions. I would love to have a dope core fan base that can support my music so I could support my family. While many aspire to be the next Wayne or Drake, I just wanna be faithful with the gift that God gave me. I wanna be that dude who can still walk through his old neighborhood and be an inspiration to kids. I want my life to be a reflection of something more than just record sales.\n\n<strong>What's next for you, professionally?</strong>\n\nChicago has a lot of artists that no one knows about and I wanna change that. I wanna use my platform to elevate others. I know this is supposed to be about me—and I appreciate the opportunity—but, please go check out Cell Blok, Brother 3, Aasha Marie, DTS, VOP, Clarence J, and Austin Downing. Those are just a few. Please give Chicago a chance. I know we have a bad rap, being this “Chiraq,” but if you look close enough, you can always find something beautiful growing from underneath the dirt.",

    "content_html": "C Wells might not have tracks on your phone yet, but he’s trying to reserve some space in the future. This young emcee reps Lynn, MA an area just outside of Boston; it's nicknamed the “City of Sin,” and the fact that Boston gangster films Black Mass and The Departed were both shot there, should give you an idea of the burg. Wells is set to be the star that sheds light on this vice city’s burgeoning hip-hop scene.\n\nC Wells, dropped an 8-track mixtape of freestyles entitled <em>Dear, Summer</em> in July 2016, on which he murked the season’s biggest beats and got listeners anticipating his imminently approaching album <em>Before The Tour Bus</em>. This upcoming effort illustrates the grind that goes into a successful career; before stardom’s inevitable arrival. Not to mention, it is hosted by Mr. Co-Sign himself, Don Cannon. Before The Tour Bus includes features from G Herbo & Dave East and production from C-Sick.\n\n“It was about the middle of February, and I’m about half way thru the project at this time, and I was sitting on a song I knew had the potential to be a hit” C Wells commented to Mass Appeal. “I had already finished one verse, but I needed one more [verse]. My partner Chy told me he wanted to make a record with East and me happen and this was the perfect track. Of course, I was down with it, but coming from where I’m from, things like that usually don’t pull through; but Chy reached out, and Dave was down. I got Dave’s verse and ‘Off The Porch’ was born!”\n\nhttps://soundcloud.com/livefamousdl/off-the-porch-feat-dave-east-prod-dreyouahitmaker",

    "content_html": "<blockquote>\"I don't want just to name drop, but there are some cool sounds being created with some truly talented people.\" —Calev</blockquote>\n[dropcap]S[/dropcap]inger and producer Calev has a lot going for him; I got into his music quite recently. It was after hearing a track he produced, \"<a href=\"http://aboveaveragehiphop.com/aaron-cohen-shows-love-to-50-cent-on-queen/\">Queen$</a>\" — by Aaron Cohen. From there I dove into his catalogue that includes tracks for Emilio Rojas and Dizzy Wright. What I found most impressive, though, were his singles. To date, he's dropped four which seem to be resonating with all the right people.\n\nI reached out to Calev on Twitter, and he took some time out chat about his beats, his rhymes, and his life. Check out the interview below.\n\nhttps://soundcloud.com/prodbycalev/recyclables\n\n<b>How did you get into music?</b>\n\nMy adopted father was a musician.\nHe played guitar and sang, and was pretty successful actually. He was able to travel all over the world performing and growing up around that; I found a love for music at a young age.\n\n<b>Who are your influences?</b>\n\nMy dad, Pharell, Prince, Bob Dylan, Outkast (I'm probably the biggest Andre 3000 fan in the world) Lupe, Jay, etc.\n\nThere's a lot of non-hip hop influences, and hardly any newer hip-hop artists impress or inspire me at all. It sounds like an old man thing to say, but I'm 24, and I just have the expectation that music should make you feel something. I guess it's something that not a lot of rappers these days are capable of doing.\n\nDon't get me wrong, there are rappers who do that, but when empty viral content is being pushed by the media for profit's sake, those artists are somewhat ignored.\n\n<b>Would you consider yourself a producer first, or an artist?</b>\n\nHonestly, I just love making music; I don't categorize myself as either. I think that there are some things that I can't express in a song, or rap, that I can through music, but it goes both ways. I just create whatever it is that I'm feeling at the moment. If it comes out as a beat that's great if it's a song, even better.\n\nThat seems like a bit of a cliche answer, but I just make music to express, people just happen to feel it, I guess.\n\n<b>What came first? What sparked the transition?</b>\n\nI started producing initially. I think I was like 13 or 14 at the time. I was in a foster home, and we had gone to Barnes & Noble or something, and they had a Computer Music magazine that came with a demo of Ableton Live (a super early version), and I started trying to make beats on there.\n\nI played guitar, drums, piano, and violin as a kid, and so having that knowledge of music, and experience helped me a lot when it came to producing. In the last year or so, I was blessed to get quite a few placement with artists that I like, as people and as artists.\n\nI guess that just making those connections, seeing their passion for what they're doing, and the fact that they liked the ideas I had come up with made me want to start working on my music as well. I think a huge moment was when Just Blaze tweeted a song that I helped produce, to me that validated what I had been working on, and motivated me to keep going with it.\n\n<b>What can you tell me about the three singles you've dropped so far--is there an album coming?</b>\n\nThe first two singles were meant to showcase my mainstream appeal. To just show that I can make those types of records, or make songs that your average rap fan in 2017 would want to hear.\n\nWith that being said, that is not the type of rap that I want to be known for at all. I think it's empty; it doesn't serve a purpose other than to be entertaining. I have a story that I want to tell, as well as shed light on all the places that I have seen us as a people, and as a society, have gone wrong — or places where we have lost our way.\n\nThat brings us to \"Feel Good,\" which touches on some of those topics, even if at a just below the surface level. I plan to delve deeper into those subject as the releases continue. If I dropped them all at once, I think it might be a little too heavy to for the average listener. As far as an album, I think I just want to put out singles and videos for a while before announcing anything like that. I was periscoping the other day and played about 50 songs for the people on there. I have enough material for a few albums, but I would rather continue the momentum by dropping weekly singles.\n\n<b>You've produced for the likes of Aaron Cohen, Dizzy Wright, Emilio Rojas, JayIDK and more. Who else have you produced for? Any crazy placements coming up?</b>\n\nMy first placement was a Fred The Godson record. I think it was a feature actually like he had done a feature for someone on my beat. That was probably in 2015. I think the next one was \"Eat Your Heart Out\" by OnCue, that was the record that Just Blaze was feeling a lot. Then I connected with Emilio and sent some records back and forth; his work ethic is crazy. I would send a folder of beats, and he'd hit me back later that night or the next day with tons of song ideas. He and I have been working a lot lately. He did a 30 for 30 challenge, dropping a freestyle video every day for 30 days and about half of the beat were made by me. We also have a couple of full-length songs that we are working on as well.\n\nAs far as future placements, it's hard to tell, because sometimes an artist will say that they need a certain beat, and then not use it for a year, or 6 months or whatever.\n\nMakonnen has a few, Roy Woods I think, Mark Battles, Cartier Dave (Two-9). There's a lot honestly. I don't want just to name drop, but there are some cool sounds being created with some truly talented people.\n\n<b>You seem to be leveraging your clients, featuring them on your singles. Can we look forward to a feature for Aaron Cohen or Dizzy Wright?</b>\n\nI mean we just have a mutual respect for each other's talents and our art, and so we can collaborate in different forms. I do have a record with both of those guys though, and some of the other artists I'm producing for as well.\n\n<b>Who do you think has next in the game?</b>\n\nJ.I.D, Bas, Sylvan Lacue, Kyle, my brother Lance Valley, is the most talented human being I have ever met, and he has a lot of amazing music coming out soon, that I'm helping produce. There's a lot of people that I think will see new success this year, but those are just a few of the people that I've been listening to lately. There are way too many people to list, though.",

Sitting at eight tracks in length--and featuring \"F The World\" as a closer--he explores solid songwriting and traverses quality and cohesive production on standouts like \"Shoosh,\" the tile track, and \"Home Tonight.\" At points, it has a late 90s feeling to it; it's a good balance.\n\nRecorded by Big Chris and John Robinson at Clique Studios, London and Miami Live, Miami. The album mix was finalised by Mixbytrip at Circle House Miami. Inspirations of The Dream, Mike Posner and R Kelly can be heard throughout.\n\nDefinitely put this project on your weekly playlist if you're down for some quality R&B; Big Chris has something special here.\n\n<iframe src=\"https://open.spotify.com/embed/album/1RLFXH3cGzHgkT5jOuGbs5\" name=\"frame1\" scrolling=\"auto\" frameborder=\"no\" align=\"center\" height = \"400px\" width = \"620px\">\n</iframe>",

Just this past week they released a brand new visual from the EP, \"The Message,\" and it's made me fall in love with this project all over again.\n\nAn upfront pleasant surprise was that the video—which is dedicated to their producer Rob Dinero who passed away earlier this year—was directed by Brian Gregory from my hometown, Toronto. His name has floated around for some time now. He's worked with the likes of \"Diamond Girl\" singer Ryan Leslie and has since shot the very scenic visual for Toronto artist Pyrex's buzz-worthy single \"Make It.\" He brought the song to life.\n\n\"Inside the booth, I'm accountable for what I say you.\" That line describes the underlying vibe of the track. Upon my original run with the EP, I always felt this track was the unintentional palate cleanser; its elongated purpose was to be a motivational 'overcome shit' anthem, but it works to reinforce the fact that Cost—the slightly Jigga cadenced Emcee—was speaking from a place of authenticity. The record on the whole really does see him pouring out a lot of shit, from a loss to thoughts of suicide, so this song was a way of saying that it's all \"real talk.\"\n<blockquote>\"Whether you like me or not I'm here to enlighten/but I been lost my head like Tyson fighting.\" — Cost</blockquote>\nMuch like the song, and the album—as I discussed before—the video's styling and the pace is upbeat and fun. I felt the band's greatest strength on the EP was dropping all their realness in an accessible way; if you didn't understand English, or just weren't paying deep attention to the lyricism it comes across as perfect summer soundtracks for your daily movements through the city.\n\n365 days later, and this EP still bangs. \"The Message\" was my favorite song at the time, and now—seeing it come to life in a visual treatment—I have it in the rotation all over again.\n\nCheck it out, below. And if you slept on the EP last summer, wake up!\n\nhttps://youtu.be/BR7gv7FdQeE",

    "content_html": "[dropcap]O[/dropcap]fficial Army Of The Pharaohs and Demigodz emcee Blacastan has been steadily staking his claim to the title of ‘savior of underground rap music’ since his debut mixtape <i>Me Against The Radio</i> and its key cut and video \"Life Of A Tape\" became an underground cult classic in 1997. He has since racked up appearances on Jedi Mind Tricks <i>Violence Begets Violence</i>, the Army of The Pharaohs albums <i>In Death Reborn</i> and <i>Heavy Lies The Crown</i>, the Demigodz <i>Killmatic</i> album, Apathy’s <i>Wanna Snuggle?</i>, Mr Lif’s <i>Don’t Look Down</i> and Czarface’s <i>A Fistful of Peril</i>, plus toured extensively across Europe, North America, and Australia with Celph Titled and Block McCloud.\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Now he's back alongside producer Stu Bangas with <i>The Uncanny Adventures of Watson & Holmes</i>, a sophomore effort that improves on the first in every way. Stu gets completely brutal with the beats, and Blac ups the ante on the rhymes. Plus, they’ve enlisted Ill Bill (Non-Phixion, La Coka Nostra), Nutso, Apathy (Demigodz, AOTP) 7L & Esoteric (AOTP, Czarface), and Tragedy Khadafi to lend their talents to the project.</p>\nBlac explains that this time around, he “really dug in and executive produced it: every sample, every transition, every edit.” He adds “People might not realize it, but this album took 4 years to make! I also worked closely with engineer Eddie Sancho on crafting the actual sound of the album... Stu and I are so familiar with each other’s process that we already know what the other is thinking before he thinks it.” Stu elaborates, saying that “this time around we tried out different tempos, different vibes for songs, and Blac played around with different rhyme patterns, so it shows how we have both grown as artists.”\n\nBlacastan & Stu Bangas <i>The Uncanny Adventures</i> <i>of Watson & Holmes</i> will be released on 6-9-17 via Brick Records.\nhttps://soundcloud.com/brickrecords/blacastan-stu-bangas-war-crimes-f-tragedy-khadafi",

    "content_html": "[dropcap]R[/dropcap]apper and indie label owner, EON MC ETC., has been in the game for years—since the age of five to be exact. Now, ten years since he dropped his first solo-LP A Reckonin, he's celebrating his latest release Southern L.O., a follow-up to last year's Fighting Demons, a collaborative project with Adduci, which we wrote about shortly after the release.\n\nAt nine songs deep, the project is a super dope blend of lyricism and syrupy southern production. As he explained in his recent interview with Ivy Cayden, from My Multi-Track Mind, \"Southern L.O. is an ode to my hometown: Lawton, Oklahoma.\" Songs like the soulful feel-good vibe of the title-track, and the last track, \"Thunder Up, Ya\"—which is an apparent hype up record dedicated to the city's sole professional sports franchise—definitely lives up to his vision.\n\nSome more interesting moment on the record come later on, like \"Coulda Been,\" which is—in simplest terms—a unique 90s R&B tinged take on a concept similar to Common's classic \"I Used To Love Her.\" Personally, this record for the most replay while taking in the album. It differs from Common's version in that it's more about the artist that sticks it out, even when fame doesn't come as quick as they hoped, only to see other pop off—inexplicably.\n\n\"Hollywood Heist,\" with its swing-vibe is another cool track on the album. One thing that stands out is his wordplay; he makes a lot of reference to the state of hip-hop, from artists in \"Southern L.O\" failing to build each other up, to straight up wack Emcees who are seemingly eroding the culture.\n\nOverall, the project is a solid listen the didn't require any skimming of skipping—and is the second full-length project I've heard from EON. Add it to your playlist this week—and so yourself a favor and check his catalog!\n\nhttps://soundcloud.com/unitedstatements/coulda-been\n\nhttps://soundcloud.com/unitedstatements/hollywood-heist",

    "content_html": "[dropcap]2[/dropcap]5-year-old Dallas, Texas, based producer/artist Huss has been on our radar for a while now. In fact, Magnetic Magazine included his track <em>#Bae</em> on their <a href=\"http://www.magneticmag.com/2015/04/top-10-tracks-that-describe-dallas/\"> definitive \"Dallas\" </a>song list. With influences from grungy rock, smooth R&B, electro, jazz, and southern vibes combined, he has a unique sound. He recently hit us off with <em>Bonfire</em>, his first full-length project. At ten tracks in length, it's part beat tape, part self-help seminar, and part EP in one well-produced package.\n\nA bulk of the tape is simply Instrumentals; there's the slow, grimy bass of \"Jurassic,\" the more upbeat head nodding bounce of \"Waves,\" and the electro/piano vibe of \"META,\" which is emblazoned with a self-help monolog. The tone of the latter is simple, \"don't let dreams be dreams.\"\n\nHe does have guest vocals from the likes of SMOKESTKZ, Osiris Ruff, and BLXCK SINATRA (on two records). While all of the songs with vocals are in the same pocket, they have completely different vibes. The crown jewel, though, is BLXCK SINATRA's \"Harmonic.\" The record's snapping drum pattern and the jazzy undertones make for an incredible vibe. \"Life's a bitch, but she'll love you if you hit it right -- I did a lot of wrong, I been trying to get it right,\" raps BLXCK amid cool jazzy horns.\n\nThere is also an alternate version (from that on <a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/hussonthebeat/hu-x-blxck-sinatra-harmonic\">SoundCloud</a>). The YouTube version appears to have more contextual interludes making for a better listening experience -- not unlike the album mixes that J.Rocc provides for Dilla releases. As well, the alternate sequencing seemed to make more sonic sense.\n\nThis project is made for long summer nights riding around with the windows down; if you're not up on Huss, give <em>Bonfire</em> a spin. Adjust your bass accordingly.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lB4IoXfDqsc&t=60s",

Upon first listen, the album's second song, \"Own Light,\" immediately jumped out at me -- as a seemingly overarching guiding principal for the project, and an overwhelmingly positive message. \"I mean, it’s interesting that it’s the manifesto of the album,\" he told me in conversation (for another publication), \"it’s a mission statement of the album -- and of my life right now.\"\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04bp4bG6Zhk\n\nThe song's origin is just as esoteric and amazing as you'd expect. \"I’d had that music for a while, and I knew that it was going to be the anthem of the album, he explains. \"I tried to write it a few times, and it wasn’t quite coming together right. Then, while I was on a spiritual retreat, we had a period of silence, where you can’t -- you know -- read anything, write anything, or take in any content, screens, conversations or anything like that. You spend time with just yourself and your heart.I ended up writing that song in my head and my heart during that period of silence, where I couldn’t physically write it down. I had to hold it and keep going over it in myself often till I could get there.\"\n\nHe also spoke on his downtime:\n\n\"There are these times where I just want to listen, and I just want to learn and grow. I’m not always interested… I don’t always feel like I have the thing that I need to tell everybody. If I don’t have something like that, then I don’t do it. A big part of the reason why I do this, and the beautiful thing about being an independent artist -- especially because we’re not like wealthy -- is that we have a lot of freedom in our time. I take full advantage of that. I may not be rich, but I’m free. I’m taking full advantage of that freedom.\"\n\nDuring our time, we discussed much more, which you can read <a href=\"http://exclaim.ca/music/article/brother_ali_goes_deep_on_his_muslim_faith_on_all_the_beauty_in_this_whole_life\">here on Exclaim!

    "content_html": "[dropcap]M[/dropcap]ost heads with any sort of hand or ear to the Jersey scene has heard of Broadway Blake. Born and raised in one of Newark’s toughest neighborhoods, Blake -- like many of his peers -- needed all the inspiration he could find. Luckily hip hop was the escape that provided him that. He came in the game with a strong mixtape run, followed by a solid indie release, Broadway Empire. He's currently to work towards Broadway Empire 2 while contributing as a member of the buzz worthy <a href=\"http://aboveaveragehiphop.com/vibes-in-the-city-interview-with-jersey-supergroup-lifecrew/\">LiFECREW collective</a>.\n\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/317180973&color=ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false\"></iframe>\n\nMore notably, though, Blake has transcended the everyday hustle and worked to develop a platform for talent to connect and be heard -- offline. Vibes In The City held weekly in the heart of Newark, has become a successful series, thus far running for over year.\n\n\"I started Vibes In The City because I felt like there was so much talent in Jersey, but not enough opportunities,\" says Blake. \"There's not enough outlets and platforms where the artist can build and network on a regular basis.\" As an artist himself, he understands the frustration of having to go \"out of town\" to feel like your moving your career forward -- especially when you have to consider travel and living expenses. \"It's a lot of money for starving artists to get a foot in the door.\" He initially wanted to build something locally; something that artists felt like they were getting value from by building their network and fan base.\n\n\"I also thought it would be perfect for us to have a home where we can practice our craft -- even if it was just once a week,\" Blake also notes. \"Luckily, I've been able to build it with people who have a similar vision for it as me. For a long time Jersey had a stigma of not wanting to support our own, so we wanted to be one of the outlets that broke that wall down. I had the idea for Vibes In The City in my notebook for at least 5-6 years, and I would always go back to it and tweak things based on other events I would attend.\"\n\nOnce Blake found the perfect location, everything fell into place, and Vibes In The City was born on January 6th, 2016. Since then it has become a \"haven\" for artists in the community. However, it beginning to branch out further than even Blake had initially imagined; \"through our social media presence, we have been able to attract artists from all over the world -- including Brazil, Miami, Milwaukee, Philly ... that's just to name a few.\"\n\n\"To date, we have been going 70 consecutive weeks, and every day we think of ways to evolve it make it more beneficial for artists, fans and our independent scene as a whole.\" What started as a goal to have a weekly hub is always evolving in concept, and Blake and his co-founders have lofty goals for its future. \"Why not Coachella? Why not Afropunk Fest? Why not Made In America or SXSW? Of course, we're talking about five maybe even 10+ years from now -- but why not think as big as possible? Thanks to the endless amounts of talents and creative minds we've been able to meet through Vibes In The City, the plans are unlimited.\"\n\nIf you're in the Tri-State, drop by Vibes In The City any -- or every -- Wednesday; if you're an artist, get at Blake and be a part of",

    "excerpt": null,
    "content_html": "[dropcap]I[/dropcap]n a brief but searing Twitter rant, young artist Russ, who — let me be clear — is incredibly dope, had some less than flattering things to say about Hip Hop blogs. After being what he perceived as stonewalled on his epic come up by \"pompous\" writers, he now is vehemently spreading a simple message: blogs don't matter.\n\nAs a writer, it obviously rubbed me the wrong way. More importantly, though, it made me stop and consider the reasons I even do this. I've been in love with writing since a child. Although I've dabbled as an artist — which you can explore if you're interested — I've always been fascinated with Hip Hop journalism, and am fortunate to be in a position to contribute to some of the most respected sites in the game.\n\nWhy do I do it? I love having critical conversations about \"art,\" which is what I view Hip Hop is; but more than that, I love to share stories. I love to research, discover and share stories that hopefully put you on to elements/angles of the music you're listening to that perhaps you didn't consider. I also like to shine a light on music that maybe you haven't caught on to yet. I'm a storyteller; I'm a curator, I'm a creative. I'm not necessarily a make or break platform for artists. My nod or approval doesn't necessarily equate to an artist's success. It does, though, often create compelling conversations, and give their built in fans something to enjoy.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oorK4RPgZ8Q\n\nIs it my job to show love to every single artist that exists? No. Russ, like many artists before him, was stuffing writer's inboxes, and — back in 2014 — was spazzing on them for not responding in a timely fashion. Even though he did get mad love at a point. However, Russ did make it, and his debut broke the top 10 Billboard 200, without blog support. Much like G4shi, <a href=\"http://aboveaveragehiphop.com/indie-af-rapper-hi-rez-grinds-his-way-into-itunes-charts/\">Hi-Rez</a>, and other artists who have been building massive followings under the radar — systematically and organically.\n\nDoes his success mean that blogs don't matter? Well, no. Not quite. For every 3 Russes, there are thousands of artists who find new audiences and expand their industry — and social — credibility using blogs and curated online Hip Hop platforms. Also, consider the relationship between writers, PR, management, and labels. To a degree, shunning media is shunning a great faction of the industry.\n\nRuss, and his like-minded peers, are entitled to their thoughts on the credibility and usefulness of blogs — and writers — but don't generalize and put us in a box because you perhaps didn't catch the ear or imagination of the contacts you reached to. Speaking for myself, I put my heart and soul into contributing to the culture and lending my pen in support of good music.\n\nCan I live [*Jay-Z voice]?\n\n(BTW, Russ' album is fire.)",

His latest — self-engineered — new mixtape A New Day is a testament to that. The hard working Emcee and father of three wants to be a \"positive role model for his family and — most importantly — to provide inspiration to aspiring musicians. He's bringing something different and working to stand out in a sea of commonalities.\n\nHe was mentored by some of the top producers in the game, while helped him to elevate his engineering skills on this new project — something he's very proud of.\n\nHis latest drop from the project is \"Gas And Gods\" featuring the much hailed Connecticut artist Apathy and Blacastan, who recently dropped Watson & Holmes alongside producer Stu Bangas.

    "content_html": "<blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">\"Stuffing bread and cheese in my pants -- I got hot pockets.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n[dropcap]I [/dropcap]love to see -- or should I say hear -- growth and progression of artists who I've dedicated pen time toward covering. Vero is an artist who has come across our desk in the past; back in September 2015, we took a listen to his <em>Passed Grass Education</em>, which was a brilliantly raw coming of an age-esque collection of tracks in the 90s BPM pocket with an underground vibe. His latest release, <em>Lucky With The Lights</em>, feels more fleshed out, developed and cohesive.\n\nSitting on the longer side with 16 songs, the record is largely self-produced; of the top, his cadence is what makes him stand out. His melodic flow, while not wholly original sounds different than other acts. The project traverses a few different vibes without ever going left -- with one exception. Where \"Lovestyle\" seemed the like odd man out, the other 15 tracks make for a solid journey from light up to the roach. A few standouts here are the vibed out \"Family,\" and the ultra jazzy \"Less Hate & More Soul -- both produced by Vero himself. On the later, his wordplay is crazy; \"I bag it up and flip to the ones who let they dreams slip, I sew words into sentences like a seamstress.\"\n\nHe also wins with his more singing heavy joints, like \"Second Chance,\" which feels like it's just as much about the intricate production as it is the low-key vocals. There is also a healthy dose of love in the air here, like the 'toast to his old ways' on \"Old Days\" and \"Backroads\" which are both dedicated to his day one (girl).\n\n\"I always admired Kanye West and how he was able to excel as both an artist and producer and that is what I shoot for,\" Vero told AAHH. His attention to detail reflects the influence. The 22-year-old Garden State native is preparing for an impending tour, and definitely, has the goods. <em>Lucky With The Lights</em> is worth a spin!\n\nEarly.\n\n<iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/playlists/325466065&color=ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false\" width=\"100%\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"no\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe>",

    "content_html": "[dropcap]W[/dropcap]e're in the age of the music video, and few video directors have been as trusted by real heads as Myster DL. Creeping up on his 250th video, he's worked with acts like Redman, Sean Price, Styles P, Chuck D, Cormega, and more. That's on top of film/TV, and commercial work that's helped make ILL Mannered Films such a bankable brand in the game.\n\nHis demo reel speaks for itself.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkzaB9lXnf0\n\nThe 36-year-old director recently sat with AAHH for an exclusive interview, fresh off of the release of his latest video for Kool G Rap, “Running.”\n\n<strong>How did you get involved in directing videos?\n</strong>\nIn the height of my music career, I started doing music videos in 2011. I always had an eye for photos, and I took a video editing course in college but only to fulfill course requirements. I took to it instantly and got a 100% as a grade. This did not inspire my career it's just a fun fact. About seven years after that I was on set for a music video, and the director didn’t show up, so I said to the artist “give me the camera I’ll shoot it.” Everyone had a chuckle, and I filmed it, edited on iMovie in a few hours and we put it out. It took off right away.\n\nAbout ten videos later I was shooting videos for Sean Price, Cormega, Sticky Fingaz and more. When I say right away, I mean it. My film career took off quick because I already had a name and had made so many legendary connections during my music career it was easy to approach artists because I had already produced records for most of them.\n\n<strong>Who was someone you looked up to when getting into the game?\n</strong>\nMy all time biggest influence was and is Cypress Hill. Without Cypress Hill, I doubt there would be a Myster DL. I might be someone completely different. I always enjoyed Hip Hop, but Cypress Hill’s Black Sunday album made me want to create it. The music eventually turned into making music videos which turned into making films. Cypress Hill appeared in my 1st film, and I consider them friends and peers. Eric Bobo and I have a few projects, and B-Real is on my next album.\n\n<strong>What have been career highlights for you?\n</strong>\nMy highlight was defiantly my 1st film A Sea of Green. I spent three years working on that movie. I wrote, directed, filmed, edit, produced and even acted in it and it features a slew of legendary rappers. Another moment that comes to mind is my mom seeing my name on HBO and of course directing videos for iconic MCs like Sean Price, Chuck D, LOX, and Redman.\n\n<strong>Tell me about the concept for your latest visual for Kool G Rap.\n</strong>\nI filmed three videos that day. It was a 19-hour ordeal, 10 of which was traveling back and forth. We did videos for songs with Kool G Rap, Freeway, Lil Fame, Term & Saigon. The “Running” video was supposed to come out 2nd, but things got moved around, and we went with “Running” 1st. I knew instantly I would incorporate running into the video. I didn’t want the video to be a too gangster because the 1st video we shot was a gangster movie set to a beat with all the rappers acting. So for “Running” I wanted to tell a story using bits and pieces of the MCs lyrics and manipulating it into a story about struggle.\n\n<strong>Do you have any crazy on-set stories (from any shoots)?\n</strong>\nI have a lot but will try not be incriminating. I've been on set with some big rappers that were mostly cool and some that we had to put in their place. One of my most memorable on-set memories was Chuck D driving me through Brooklyn telling me stories about the early days of Hip Hop and how he helped Ice Cube deal with his fame. I rarely pose for pictures, but I took a few that day. On the set of the Kool G Rap “Wiseguys” video, the NYPD took control of my drone and crashed it because we must have been in a restricted no fly zone.\n\nI was arrested in Brownsville, Brooklyn shooting a video for Rock of Heltah Skeltah and was locked up in the 73rd (peep my Words) for a few days over a half ounce of weed. When I got out I called Rock and said “hey man sorry I got arrested, ” and he said “no sh*t.” It took us years to finally do that video. Multiple film sets have had the police gearing up ready to take us down because they got so many calls of people brandishing guns. In our defense, they were props -- mostly.\n\n<strong>What advice do you have for up and coming directors?\n</strong>\nPut out quality work and brand yourself. Start and end every video with your logo or info. All my videos start with my ILL Mannered Films logo, and if you don’t want it to start that way, there is a lot of other good directors you can get. In an age where everything is visual, and blogs are sustained by videos, I’m surprised they rarely credit directors. By the way, this goes for nonfamous producers also.\n\nThe rapper gets all the credit for the concepts and the quality of the videos. This has happened to me countless time. You know what the rapper does? Raps. Sometimes not even that as a lot don’t know their rhymes and the director has to make the viewer not realize that. These blogs aren’t going to give you your credit so give it to yourself. I've done 235 music videos, and sometimes blogs still leave my name out.\n\n<strong>What do you have coming up?\n</strong>\nI have an ongoing documentary web series that is currently out called “Rewind The Scenes” where I look back at some of my biggest videos and go in depth on how we made them. I have episodes for over 30 legendary acts so far. I have a 10 episode comedy TV show coming out soon called The Weekend Warriors, which is wild and also features so hip hop heavyweights in some hilarious situations. I am also beginning production on my 2nd full-length film. It is an urban crime drama called As Thick As Thieves, and of course I am approaching my 250th video. Who will it be?\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvJbsjW4dEM\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cOudUVZ5sc",

I don't always respond, but I check it. I also follow-up on suggestions, especially Twitter ones. One that I recently came across was an up and coming R&B acts from France named Yo Trane. I'm not sure if you've heard of dude, but get to your Google machine instantly and look him up.\n\nHis debut EP Late Night Drive is beautiful — and hasn't gone unnoticed. \"Every major label has reached out and wanted to sign me, but I want to take my time with it,\" he shared with me. \"I'm trying to focus on the music first.\"\n\nThat's another thing that stands out about this kid; he's incredibly humble and is here for all the right reasons. \"I'm not one of those artists that are doing it for money and fame ... all I care about is creating dope music.\"\n\nThe mark of a true artist, for me, is knowing that if all their shine disappeared in a second, they'd still make music. Not to try and \"get back on,\" but because not making music hurts them on multiple levels.\n\nHe recently took some time to chat about his background, his career and more.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUP27wH93WI\n\n<strong>How'd you get into music?\n</strong>\nI fell in love with Hip Hop and R&B music at a young age. I started learning English so I could understand what my favorite artists were saying. My mom is a great singer, so I've always been able to hit notes and flow on a beat cause it's in my genes — but I wasn't confident. I was scared of pursuing that dream.\n\nI dropped out of college, lived in a shitty apartment, and would hang out with friends and party all the time. My life was going nowhere. I felt locked until my bro Kalim (my producer) told me I should take the music thing serious. He thought I had talent.\n\nI started recording [raps] over his beats then let my friends and family listen to those. You know your homies are always gonna say your shit is dope. [Laughs] What mattered to me was my mom's opinion. She said it was trash. I quickly realized rap music wasn't for me and I should focus more on just singing.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LrlJJ3QVQw\n\n<strong>What seems apparent, especially after watching your feature for Revolt, is your love of your music and fans. What does that stem from?\n</strong>\nIt honestly just stems from listening. My love for music has existed for as long as I can remember. I used to listen to Michael Jackson as a child, when I was sad or before going to bed. I grew up with no father, lost loved ones, experienced racism as an African kid in France, but music has always helped me. It's like it's been my best friend, I got attached to it. I listen to it all day just to escape reality.\n\nThis love for the fans comes from the fact that I don't have a lot of real homies. I'm such a loner but when someone I've never even met shows me, love, supports what I do, tells me to keep going, it makes me feel like they're my homies, you know? Because it's something that even people I was cool with didn't do back then.\n\nI hope I never let the fans down, though.\n\n<strong>Walk me through your Late Night Drive EP.\n</strong>\nKalim and I started working on Late Night Drive EP in October 2014; the project didn't even have a title at the time. I'd show up at his crib early every morning with new ideas then we'd just sit on his couch and talk about those ideas.\n\nMy goal was to make something to listen to at night, and I wanted to keep the realness of old school R&B, but make it sound fresh and different.\n\nI'm a perfectionist, so I always record hundreds of melodies then pick the best ones before I start writing. I would do that during the day and spend nights working on my lyrics. I'd listen to Aaliyah, Changing Faces, and other female artists. It helped me understand a woman's vision.\n\nProduction wise, Kalim's main inspirations were Boi 1 da and Partynextdoor. I remember seeing him watch tutorials for hours, learn how to mix and master.\n\nWhen he sent me the beat to the song Late Night Drive, I knew instantly it had to be a title track. This was the one. He wasn't feeling it, but I told him to trust me.\n\n<strong>What's the mantra behind it?\n</strong>\nThat EP means a lot of things to me. Mainly hope, and honesty. That's what I was trying to give my listeners. I had a girlfriend throughout the making of the project. We're not together anymore, but I feel like she has inspired me too. I kinda wrote about her.\n<blockquote>\"Kanye West's album College Dropout is the reason why I started learning English.\" —Yo Trane</blockquote>\n<strong>How has your life changed since it dropped?\n</strong>\nSince the project dropped, I finally believe in myself — and trust me that's a huge change. I now have listeners and fans who love what I do and wait for me to drop music they can vibe to. I moved to America last year, and it's different from where I grew up. I don't get to see my family often which sucks, but I guess it's temporary. I still do the same regular stuff and spend as much time as possible at the studio. I even work harder than I used to.\n\n<strong>One of the more surprising things is when listeners learn that you're French. Would you say your music is more influenced by the French or American scene?\n</strong>\nMy music is influenced by the American scene. Kanye West's album College Dropout is the reason why I started learning English. I wanted to know what he was saying. [laughs] I would sing all the words, but it was still gibberish to me. African vibes influence me as well.\n\n<strong>Are you signed yet?\n</strong>\nI'm not signed yet. Every major label has reached out and wanted to sign me, but I want to take my time with it. I'm trying to focus on the music first.\n\n<strong>Tell me more about Kalim.\n</strong>\nWell, Kalim is my brother. He's the one who made it all happen. He bought our first studio equipment, made all my beats, recorded my vocals, mixed them, mastered them, It's way more than just producing and all this wouldn't have been possible without him.\n\n<strong>So, what's next for Yo Trane?\n</strong>\nI've been working on my 2nd project, and I'll release it soon. Just trying to keep growing my fanbase.\n\nI want readers to know I'm real. I'm not one of those artists that are doing it for money and fame. All I care about is creating dope music.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDjxlN92L98",

    "content_html": "[dropcap]A[/dropcap]nother one! [*Dj Khaled voice]\n\nToday Hip Hop lost a real soldier of the game, Albert Johnson -- better known as Prodigy. Half of the infamous Queens duo Mobb Deep, 42-year-old Prodigy was the epitome of the Hip Hop that real heads loved. He was really about that street shit, he came up in an era where skills reigned supreme, and he had a distinctive vocal tone and way with words that will ultimately help uphold his legacy, which is an untouchable catalog.\n\nOver the course of his epic career, Prodigy worked with some of the most prominent architects in modern Hip Hop culture. From the hand, Q-Tip played in Mobb's classic sophomore album, to his work with Nas during the Illmatic era -- all the way to his later amalgamation with the G-Unit team -- P has been traversing the game for well over 25 years. More importantly, he never left his core audience or compromised his integrity, even in the face of the ever-changing landscape of the music industry.\n\nSidebar, if you haven't read his book, punch yourself in the face.\n\nHe's very vocally suffered from Sickle Cell Anemia all his life, and it appears complications from the disorder ultimately led to his death.\n\nThis is a monumental loss, though. At the moment I find it hard to write with a clear head, as P was truly one of my favourite rappers of all times.\n\nRIP, Dun.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3NmoqMV0Q8\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvCp-N-9JEw",

    "content_html": "[dropcap]S[/dropcap]ometimes, an affinity for music can truly run in your blood; such is the case for artist Shah33d. His grandfather was Lawrence Payton, who was 1/4 of the original Four Tops — one of the most significant groups in not just the Motown era, but also music history. \"He got to me to be interested in music ... I was writing at an early age,\" he told AAHH.\n\nHe recently released a brand new EP, which he's currently promoting. It's a solid collection, with some dope production; in fact, one of the producers he worked with was J-Louis, who is the official DJ for Bryson Tiller, whose latest album is slaying Billboard charts. He sat exclusively with AAHH to chat about his music, career, and more. Check it out below.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7zssO7nywY\n\n<b>So you just dropped a project a few weeks ago. Tell me about the mantra behind it.</b>\n\nMy latest project is called One Day At A Time, and it simply represents just that. For me being an artist, I don't like just to put music out to keep up with the current trends. For me, I felt like I have to be different — you know, inspired. So, this album is just a compilation of a bunch of experiences that I went through.I was able to put it out on wax. It took me roughly about six months to complete the project, because I wanted to make sure everything was tight, and that it was relevant and made sense to me. Hopefully, it's relative to listeners.\n\nI'm shooting a video for every song on EP. You know it's all about visuals; I already have one video for one of the songs called \"Claimed It.\" I dropped it in March.\n\n<b>Is this your first EP?</b>\n\nThis is my first official EP that's being released to streaming platforms. I released an EP back in 2012 just to get a feel for everything — It's called the \"Reflection.\" It was a decent project, you know it built up a fanbase, and it got me on the path I need to go. But this one is the official project that was released on all digital platforms, Apple music and so on and so forth.\n\n<b>What are your thoughts on the current state of the music industry? Maybe some loading questions?</b>\n\nI think that it's not balanced. You turn on a radio, you hear the same top twenty artists — when there are millions of artists who are releasing music on a regular basis. In my opinion, I feel that there is a niche for every artist. If If you are a trap artist, there is a niche for you. If you are a spiritual artist, there is a niche for you. Whatever you do, there is a niche for you; but I feel like the state of hip-hop is only pushing one avenue and right now. The trend is the mumble rap. And you know, I don't knock the mumble rappers, that's cool. You know that's just the niche for them. And I feel like the music industry is doing a terrible job at balancing.\n\n<b>What would you say is your goal in the music industry; what is it that you want to achieve in your career?</b>\n\nMy goal is to go as far as the music will allow me. Featuring on major label artist songs, a couple of Grammys later on down the road; To just get the message out that you can be — you can be yourself without compromising who you are — and still be successful. As long as I get that message out, I'll feel like a part of my mission is complete. And you know, just to have fun while doing it.",

    "content_html": "[dropcap]R[/dropcap]eminder, there's no shame in not being the biggest fan of an artist. You're also not under any moral obligation to fundamentally love every artist who ever died. Feels like that shouldn't be a necessary reminder — except that it is.\n\nMaster P said during a long-winded Instagram post/caption that we need to lift up and celebrate the best and brightest in our culture while they're still alive. He went on to accuse BET of showing fake love to the memory of Prodigy, who passed away last week from complications related to Sickle Cell Anemia. Let's explore that.\n\nhttps://instagram.com/p/BVyX2d2FSXQ/\n\nProdigy — half of Mobb Deep — was a pillar of realness that represented that lost 90s era where authenticity reigned supreme. While Prodigy has a vast catalog of content, it's not unrealistic to assume that a significant portion of (the more casual) Hip Hop listeners love for P peaked in two very specific eras. Mobb's classic sophomore album — specifically \"Shook Ones\" — and the commercial singles in the period between <i>Infamy</i> and <i>Blood Money</i>. I'll admit that's a hunch.\n\nNumbers do point that way, though. The farther we from <i>Blood Money</i>, the less commercial impact P was able to make. His debut solo <i>H.N.I.C</i> went gold, but — while the two subsequent installments <i>did</i> manage to chart — his solo releases never received any further certifications. What happened to the love?\n\nLike many artists who have passed before him, P had suddenly popped up on everyone's (above the underground) radar last week After his sudden passing, with many crediting him as their 'favourite' rapper. It's not a bad thing, and unfortunately an artist's passing often spurs newfound interest in their discography. However, when a network like BET suddenly becomes the \"biggest champion\" of an artist they've all but forgotten over the past decade, it seems oddly opportunistic — if not, fake (as hell).\n\nMuch like Pac, Big, Sean P, and others we've lost along the way (like Phife), Prodigy is now finding himself on lots of top rappers lists, when — in actuality — he should have been there all along if that's how you feel. The trouble is that celebration of vets like P would sure take up a lot of mental real estate that is currently is spent celebrating new and upcoming acts.\n\nThere needs to be balance; there needs to be something. Anything. Why are we the only genre that does this?We have architects who have over the way starving. WTF?\n\nIsn't it weird that people say \"it's about time\" when Pac was inducted into the Rock-N-Roll Hall Of Fame, but couldn't be bothered to shell out the $35 to help support the development and celebration of the <a href=\"http://hiphophof.tv/\">Hip-Hop Hall Of Fame</a>?\n\nThe frustration of an act like Master P is understandable, as he (while not as lyrically gifted) has made similar impacts on the culture which he is not as recognized for as he could be. I get it. You should, too.\n\nYounger heads should do their homework, and at least try to understand P's impact on the game. He has lots of great music for you to discover. But you don't have to hold him up as the greatest to ever do it. It's ok to love or rekindle a love for fallen soldiers, but dick riding the dead for good optics is unnecessary. Pause.\n\nPS read his book. It's in <em>my </em>Top 5.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N95jQoAlOAA",

    "content_html": "[dropcap]T[/dropcap]he latest round of DMCA takedowns is further illustrating something we've dealt with personally in the past: the thin line between media and piracy. Today, some massive blogs were suspended on Twitter following a -- \"supposedly\" -- mistaken DMCA complaint from Atlantic records surrounding the publishing of a Young Thug tracklisting.\n\nIt's far from the first time such a thing has happened, but it's one of the more widespread situations, involving sites like Pigeons And Planes, Fader, and more.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/Navjosh/status/875702746862714880\n\nhttps://twitter.com/BenFrankIV/status/879729898142789632\n\nhttps://twitter.com/ThatTorontoGirl/status/879736411020288001\n\nIn the past, we've also faced similar reprimands from networks like Facebook and Twitter, which is frustrating as a media outlet who spends the majority of their time delivering promotion for artists. Many of the mechanisms in place that prevent the general public from sharing and streaming copyrighted content should -- in some cases -- be amended for the press -- in our opinion.\n\nWe've personally had situations where sharing content shared directly from artists /labels/management has led to heavy-handed discipline and a ton of headaches.\n\nAll something like this does is sour blogs from covering Young Thug in the future, in fear that a potential social downtime situation could negatively impact any partnerships or obligations on the part of sponsored content.\n\nWe are <em>not</em> your enemy!",

    "content_html": "<blockquote>\"Dancing with the devil with my dog on my daily grind.\" — Vin-O</blockquote>\n[dropcap]T[/dropcap]his is my second time round with DC-native Vin-O. Last year I took you guys through his record <i>Death Of A Poet, Birth Of A Gamesta</i>, which was a super impressive listen. As I mentioned last time, his bio benefited from a co-sign and worked with producer Chuckie Thompson. Chuckie's catalogue includes monster records like the \"Flava In Ya Ear Remix\" and \"Big Poppa\" from the heyday of Bad Boy Entertainment — and most recently the Biggie and Faith \"collabo\" <i>The</i> <i>King</i> <i>&</i> <i>I</i>. I had high hopes for his latest project, <i>Truth</i>, <i>Understanding</i>, <i>Poetry</i>, <i>And</i> <i>Culture</i>, which is actually a clever acronym for Tupac.\n\nI wasn't let down.\n\nAt 22 songs in length, there is a lot to get through. If you follow my writing, you'll know how I feel about projects of this length; they demand quite a lot of attention. It's a reason that many writers I know were shying away from reviewing the new DJ Khaled record. And that's a star-studded affair — so imagine how most would react to a lesser known act?\n\nI digress.\n\nWhile he may have tried to do a little too much on this LP, it's done well. There is a healthy balance of self-actualization, retrospective outlook, love, storytelling, and real life shit. Production is solid, and helps him bob and weave through subject matter without it become too jarring.\n\nThere are standouts as you commit to the project. The \"Welcome To The Mardi Gras\" sampled \"SummaTime N Da City\" is grittier take on a seasonal ode. I could easily see this becoming one of the singles. \"Sometimes I sit back and go wonder, could we not have a single Murder the whole summer,\" he ponders on the track's third verse.\n\nAnother big tune was \"Me N My Mans,\" which reminds me a lot of the Tupac track, \"Pour Out A Lil' Liquor,\" if only just content wise. The production stands out, to me.\n\n\"Infamous\" is another big song that comes quite early on in the track list. Notably, O notes that Chuckie gave him a beat meant for Biggie; however, he isn't specific on which beat. That sounds like a whole story in itself\n\nOther must-listen tracks are the piano-driven \"Born Winner,\" \"3:10 AM in Forestville,\" and the third-eye-open vibe of \"Cold,\" with its jazzy drum pattern.\n\nOverall, it's a solid release. Honest, detailed, and deeply personal at points. He also still manages to intersperse tracks like \"Paranoia,\" which is more of a club/street song. Vin-O is far from one-dimensional, which is refreshing!\n\nEarly!\n\n<iframe style=\"border: 0; width: 350px; height: 786px;\" src=\"http://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=2649067836/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/transparent=true/\" seamless><a href=\"http://music.denarddapoet.com/album/truths-understanding-poetry-and-culture\">Truths, Understanding, Poetry And Culture by VIN-O (formerly Denard Dapoet)</a></iframe>",

    "content_html": "[dropcap]W[/dropcap]hen you hear the term most exciting artist on the Irish Hip Hop scene, you may be apt to expect someone more — well — Irish. Ignorance of Ireland's dynamic aside, we've long been fed small glimpses into the scene. For example, I've been up on Rob Kelly for a while now; however, he noticeably sounded Irish. Mythill Grim is a different experience. The Nigerian-born MC had a few keywords attached to him, so my introduction required a unique strategy.\n\nI was prepped that he was a little on the darker side, so I opted to only listen to his three latest singles without the visual for the first few passes.\n\nFirst impression was great. He has such a unique cadence that it's almost hard to pinpoint his geographical origin. When listened to in order, his first three singles \"Crestfallen,\" \"Leave Me Alone,\" and the newest, \"Comfortable,\" do have a darker feeling to them. In succession, they almost play out as a downward spiral of sorts.\n\nBeginning with \"Crestfallen,\" we hear the young MC describing an emotional rock bottom; the song can either be taken at face value as an overall dependent love or as  a depressing description of falling deep in love — or want — for someone. \"Leave Me Alone\" feels like an ode to social detachment, and whether you choose to assume he's talking to you (the listener) or the same someone from \"Crestfallen,\" is subjective. \"Comfortable,\" again assuming there is some direct connection, is the dissolution of the relationship — as the result of potential infidelity.\n\nHow, once you watch the actual visuals, the songs — which have incredible production, BTW — have become much darker. \"Crestfallen\" looks how it sounds, but the color and face paint on \"Leave Me Alone\" has an unnerving aura. When discussing \"Leave Me Alone\" with District Magazine's Eric Donaldson, he explained, “It was just supposed to be a fun freestyle, but my heart got in the way.” The songs Nigerian intro also has a fun bit of \"hidden message\" appeal to it.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxajscE3rXk\n\nIt all comes to a disturbing conclusion in \"Comfortable,\" where we're led to conclude he's killed his unfaithful girlfriend, and maybe even himself. Even that strange character who seems to be following him through his last two visuals is creepy AF. Could be it symbolize the darkness inside of him?\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbrmPfWSol0\n\nThe music itself is really interesting and draws you in. Not quite trap-soul vibes, it's a night drive that sounds as though it hasn't seen the sunshine in ages! It's a really dope -- and evident why this kid seems to be connecting with audiences.\n\nGive it a spin.",

    "content_html": "[dropcap]S[/dropcap]ort of quirky — and super unique — singer Shelita Burke is a singer I wrote about last year when she released her EP <i>Transfixed</i> and lead single \"Belong,\" which was produced by industry vet Bellringer. If you missed my previous piece (<a href=\"http://aboveaveragehiphop.com/shelita-burke-gives-brain-orgasms-with-her-new-single/\">shame on you</a>), I'll give you a quick Cliff's Notes on why you need to check Shelita Out.\n\nFor starters, some of the most trusted names in music, like NPR, have mentioned her as an artist to watch, and — upon her initial release — was of MTV's top 10 artists overall (on their artist platform), which is bonkers. She's toured around the world and lives in both Paris and LA, which gives her a super broad perspective on things and, lest we forget, <i>Transfixed</i> reached #14 on Amazon's Music Charts.\n\nShe has a really strong social media presence, and a supportive core audience that wants to see her win; her schtick is connecting.\n\nLastly, she stood out to me because of her obsession with Autonomous Sensory Meridian Response (ASMR). She explained it last year as “a pleasurable tingling ‘brain tickle’ effect. Yeah, she gives brain orgasms. So, that's an auto spin in my books.\n\nShelita recently released a new track called \"Penetrate (Part 2),\" a follow-up to the Bellringer produced \"Penetrate\" that hit #14 on Billboard’s ‘Next Big Sound’ chart. The song has an almost early 2000's Neptune's vibe to it and a less than subtle sexiness that lends itself perfectly to beers on warm summer evening, or a solo late-night drive through a sleepy metropolitan city centre. Her super unique cadence sparkles, and her songwriting shine.\n\nThe song's press releases teased an upcoming video for the song, which I'm excited to see.\n\nShelita doesn't just have fans; she has superfans. That's for a good reason; it's not something that Incan easily pinpoint, but she has it factor and 'cuteness' (that perfectly counterbalances the sensuality of her songs). Check out the new track for yourself!\n\nhttps://soundcloud.com/shelitaburke/penetrate-part-2",

    "content_html": "[dropcap]D[/dropcap]olla$ignDunn is a New Jersey rapper that we've featured here on AAHH before. But — to get deeper — he's an artist that I've been following for a while. From the actual onset of our website, he's been steadily feeding us emails (politely) asking us to check out his latest music.\n\nTo be transparent, it wasn't until more recently that I started to not only notice him and his team more — as they're having a great run on the local/indie circuit — but also feel a little slow for sleeping on him.\n\nI decided to reach out to Dunn to chat about his career — and what he has in the cannon. Check out the Q&A below!\n\nhttps://youtu.be/C_jjZxKDpxo\n\n<b>What's been a highlight of 2017 for you so far? The squad seems to be on a good run.</b>\n\nIt's hard to pinpoint one highlight, it been a good year all around (and it's only June). But, I would say the on-going support and connecting to people is probably the best thing to happen this year.\n\n<b>How did you get into this game?</b>\n\nAround like 12-13 I would rewrite my favorite songs and revise them. So, I learned how to structure songs way before I even thought about rapping. I would make freestyle videos with my homie in high school and saw people reacting to them well. Fast forward a few years later; my brother had started a label that I was always a supporter of, and I got involved musically around 2014. Since then I've been moving!\n\n<b>Who did you look to as and influence early on?</b>\n\nCam'ron, Ma$e, and Allen Iverson. Cam'ron's innovative style — and the way he approached music with a \"you gonna hear what I gotta say\" type of attitude — is the same way I move. Ma$e had this smooth as a breeze kind of aura in his early Bad Boy days that many people say I possess. AI was a superhero to me growing up. To me, the way he finessed the NBA, doing things his way, is the same way I live my life.\n\n<b>Let's talk about your new joint \"Cruisin'.\"</b>\n\nThis record is my favorite joint at the moment. I recorded it on new years and just knew it was one of those songs that people will f*ck with. I performed it a couple of times and had every venue rocking once this went off. Unlike [some of] my other music this shows my fun side — the Dolla$ignDunn that people see when they meet me face to face.\n\n<b>What are you working on?</b>\n\nAs of now I'm just building my catalog and helping shape the UpperClass brand. I have a few more records ready to drop before the summer's over. May or may not have a project dropping shortly; who knows?\n\n<b>What's your goal in this game?</b>\n\nI'm more focused on connecting with the people directly rather than getting attention from folks in the industry. I'm a firm believer in cutting out the middle man so as much as I can do on my own I'm gonna do it. I'm focused on creating an everlasting wave that'll carry my name as well as the UC brand.\n\n<b>What coming up?</b>\n\nI have a lot of things up my sleeve — always three steps ahead. With that being said, be on the look-out for more content from my camp and me.\n\nhttps://soundcloud.com/dollasigndunn/cruisin-ft-twondon",

Scottie started making music back in his high school and had a nice little buzz brewing until that street life caught up with him. He caught a slew of gun and drug charges that cost him a 8 to 16-year bid -- though he ultimately served eight. After his first taste of freedom back in 2015, he returned to Boston determined to put his everything into pursuing this music game.\n<blockquote>\"Went away for like eight summers/If I don't make it Imma take something.\"</blockquote>\nHe's been full stream ahead, and -- this September -- he's slated to drop what he hopes will be his breakthrough EP, No Man's Land. He was gracious enough to give AAHH a premiere oof his first offering from the project, \"FR.\" An acronym for \"For Real,\" the slow trappy vibes provided by TheBeatPlug provides a perfect sound bed for Scottie to drop bars oozing with an air of authenticity. It's an enticing preview of what he has on deck for the full release\n\nGive the track a spin for yourself, and keep an eye on Scottie's social profiles for details on No Man's Land.\n\n<a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/scottienomad/\">https://www.instagram.com/scottienomad/</a>\n<a href=\"https://twitter.com/scottienomad/\">https://twitter.com/scottienomad/</a>\n\nhttps://soundcloud.com/scottienomad/fr-prod-thebeatplug/s-LYoDH",

    "content_html": "[dropcap]T[/dropcap]his isn't the first time that Se7en Eli has <a href=\"http://aboveaveragehiphop.com/making-a-difference-with-music-se7en-eli/\">come across my desk</a>; in the past, I wrote his song \"Tango,\" which blends traditional Latin music with go-go, produced by a long-time collaborator and friend — who is currently doing a seven-year bid. He's back on the scene with <a href=\"http://se7eneli.com\"><em>Progress Report</em></a>, a complete body of work that does a good job of showing a variety of vibes from the young Emcee.\n\nSomething I didn't quite catch the first time I experienced Se7en was that his cadence was a playful blend of Logic and Kendrick Lamar — in a good way. The nine-song release, which I bumped on Tidal, went through a series of emotions that manage to keep a pretty consistent BPM pocket, which made for a solid cover to cover as I drove around the six breaking down the songs.\n\nLet's start with the production — which is super solid. The soulful \"Myrrh\" intro, the Spanish guitar strings and chops on \"Marimba Rhythm,\" the jazzy vibes of \"421,\" and the slow bass of \"Farewell\" all make this project go. His beat selection is on point.\n\nLyrically, he has bars. It's conscious at points, and more — for lack of a better term — low-key at points. It's not overbearing in any one zone, which makes it digestible. \"Myrrh\" was one song I went back to multiple times. What seemed like a commentary on the business of \"being a church,\" mixed with general bars on the Hip Hop industry, was a great way to open the record, and display his wordplay off the rip.\n\n\"May the doors of the church open and let us in, but somehow I still feel cleaner than the Reverend/White gloves like we are ushering in a new generation of free thinkers, they only try to stop us 'cause they know we on the brink of/Some groundbreaking...\"\n\n\"421,\" which plays out as a hazy day-after 4.20, is full of jewels, and a smokey ambiance that Se7en rides like Chevy top down on a summer night.\n\nWhile he manages to make some light references and allusions between the trap and the \"daily grind\" and music industry, \"No Leaving The Trap\" was the one song that I felt didn't quite fit. It's still a dope track, and the guest verse from \"Eazyman\" is solid, but it feels like it could have been a separate single. Though it does open up the lanes, he can traverse.\n\nOverall,<i> Progress Report</i> feels like a literal checkpoint on where he's at. Se7en is an artist to keep an eye on. He's definitely on the AAHH watch list for 2017.\n\nEarly.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/eObFUkG5WJs",

    "content_html": "[dropcap]A[/dropcap]s a writer — for some big platforms — Incan assure you that inbox is nothing less than nauseating. I am constantly inundated with requests to check out and give some pen game to new records of varied quality. As corny as it sounds, standing out does make all the difference as I arbitrarily decide how to dedicate my daily attention span.\n\nSinger/producer Donavon gets it. The young Brooklyn-based artist offered to send anyone who gave two-cents on his latest track \"Arora\" two-cents (via PayPal)— and homie paid out! \"I have a bunch of friends who are journalists, and they’ll get a 1000 email a day,\" he said on a phone call with me earlier this month, \"you should appreciate that someone’s taking to listen to your shit.\"\n\n\"Like, if you saw that as a subject line on an email, what would you have to lose?\" he asked me, rhetorically. \"You know, like why wouldn’t I click on that shit?\"\n\nPretty slick ice breaker; and once I pressed play, I realized that the music fire — this kid is talented as hell. What began as a post on Reddit spilled over to emails, which is how it eventually floated on my radar. As an artist, Donavon is a lot like (early) Weeknd in a way; he has a shadowy persona that's devoid of identifiable characteristics, yet he does have a past, which is easily searchable (with a few hints of course).\n\n\"Everybody knows what everybody is like [personality wise] and what they look like before they put out a song — so it’s cool to pull back from that a little bit.\"\n\nOriginally performing under the name Don Scott, he was signed to a major label and shared management with Fetty Wap and Shaggy.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/1ik3ONW95Ys\n\nUnfortunately, like many similar situations it didn't quite work out; there are no hard feelings, though. \"I still do production stuff for them ... I wrote [for] a bunch of artists there, and got a bunch of production points.\" The situation, though, has prompted Donavan to approach this new chapter in his career by himself.\n\nFast-forward to \"Arora.\"\n\n\"I originally wrote and produced the song [Arora] to send to Jeremeh, but it ended up not going anywhere,\" he explained to me. \"That's common when you're trying to get production or writing placements.\"\n\nOne of the unique parts of his creative process is that he's putting a lot of thought process into creating content in tandem with visual concepts; \"the director of that video we work closely.\" Donavon continues to explain that the game plan is to \"put out visual after visual ... I’m focused on putting out videos because it’s just only thing I want to do now.\" His thought process is that having a video be the first thing people see has an infinitely higher chance of resonating off the bat.\n\n\"Like you said you get a million songs a day in your email,\" he tells me coyly, \"and, they can all be monotonous sometimes ... but a visual could help cut through [the clutter]. That's where I’m at.\nA former SoundCloud employee -- and A&R -- to be exact, who was effected by the last round of layoffs, he saw the writing on the all for using streaming audio platforms as your main hub, as opposed to video, which accounts for the highest percentage of general internet engagement.\n\nAt the end of the day, Donavon's visual for \"Arora\" is compelling and worked to peak my interest in his career and the mysteriousness of his artistic persona.\n\nCheck out the video below, and follow his Twitter. His next visual is dropping end of summer.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v3P4mAKNqxI",

    "content_html": "[dropcap]O[/dropcap]ver the last few years, DMV has played home base to some promising indie movements; Rellik JXB is no different. Wearing dual hats as both artist and CEO of his imprint, Don't Panic Records, he's making a great impression.\n\nI originally wrote about his surprisingly <a href=\"http://aboveaveragehiphop.com/a-fitting-tribute-to-a-fallen-soldier-texas-rapper-rellik-jxb-is-building-an-empire/\">dope EP <em>Se7en </em>a while back</a>, which some of my followers may recall had ridiculously unassuming cover art, but was packed with tons of flame emojis and assists from his circle of artists. His latest single, \"All Good,\" spent the latter part of the day blaring through my Monster headphones on repeat, and is a single worth touting as a summer go-to. Consider it a best-kept secret.\n<blockquote>We are gonna keep making these hits, making this green, and loving the dream.\" --Rellik</blockquote>\n\"My sound is all over the place ... I do anything from R&B to Hip Hop,\" Rellik says about his sound. This new banger is all the above, with melodic bars that ride a smooth radio-ready beat. Don't start to pigeon hole him, though. \"I try to add shock value to a lot of my lyrics so that you will be entertained. I try to make music based off of how I'm feeling or the situations that I go through at the moment.\"\n\nWith that on the table, what moment sparked this latest release? \"Lately I've been making love songs,\" he admits with a laugh, \"I guess a lady has my attention.\"\n\nThe record is just an appetizer to his upcoming album Royalty, which he is currently [literally as I write] wrapping up. \"I got the name from my Don't Panic label-mate Lo Ki,\" he explains. \"Her favorite color is purple, which represents royalty. Not to mention the fact that we are kings and queens over here at Don't Panic -- so Royalty was a perfect name for the album.\"\n\nWith well over 30k on his YouTube videos, he is continuously packing out shows throughout the DMV; but that's just the beginning. \"I plan on taking my label the highest point that we can reach. With the help of my family and friends who equally play an important part, we can make this dream come true, not just for me, but for all of us.\"\n\nTeamwork makes the dream work, and for those who want it bad enough, everything is eventual. With plans to creatively flood over into acting and comedy, it will be exciting to keep tabs on Rellik and his team. \"We have a lot of ideas that Don't Panic Records will bring to life In the coming years.\"\n\nCheck out \"All Good,\" below. Early!\n\nhttps://soundcloud.com/rellikjxb/allgood",

    "content_html": "<blockquote>\"Reject my single I ain't mad at it , like O.J. getting married again, I'll take another stab at it.\" -- Chino XL</blockquote>\n[dropcap]I[/dropcap]n the earlier days of AAHH, I had started a few columns that have since died out; one series I especially want to bring back is my <i>Great Rappers You Slept On</i> series, where I profile acts that should be (or should have been) on your radar. In past pieces, I've profiled acts like the late <a href=\"http://aboveaveragehiphop.com/great-rappers-slept-part-1-pumpkinhead/\">Pumpkinhead</a>.\n\nThis time around, we're going to look at Chino XL.\n\nIn the timeline of rappers who have been known to shock listeners with their content — like Eminem for example — none are more underrated and unappreciated than Chino XL. As far as no-holds-barred savagery goes, his 1996 effort <i>Here To Save You All</i> could very well be considered a climatical ground zero. His rhyme schemes were really clever; Chino is (literally) brilliant — like <i>Mensa</i> brilliant. Google it!\n\nHis extremely precise style was (in this debut iteration) a smorgasbord of allusions like \"My beat get messy as abortion on the ninth month.\" Or the oddly relevant \"your style's too old to do me like Aaliyah and R. Kelly.\"\n\nI think the first time I experienced Chino, was the track \"Riiiot,\" featuring Ras Kass. Specifically the bars \"Governmently engineered like Ebola for this rap garage sale/ By this industry, I'm trying not to get fucked like 2Pac in jail /You can hate me, but await me like I'm Magic Johnson's death / In a box with Jordan's pops that ass'll never take another breath.\"\n\nhttps://youtu.be/haiCAyDbejQ\n\nJust let that sink in. Within 10 seconds, he suggests that the government created and intentionally spread Ebola, perpetuates the \"Pac got raped in jail\" rumor (which has ironically come back into play recently), Magic Johnson's HIV (he still hasn't died), and the death of Michael Jordan's father -- quite callously.\n\nIn many ways, this 'I don't give a fuck' demeanor was a precursor for some of the biggest bullies in the game, like 50 Cent (think \"Ghetto Qu'ran\") and even Maino -- specifically when thinking of the song \"Rumors.\"\n\nhttps://youtu.be/RTteqDTtOhQ\n\nUnfortunately, he's hardly mentioned in any top 5 lists, which is criminal. After his debut, label bullshit kept his sophomore off shelves until 2001. He's since dropped four studio albums -- the last of which is the double disc, <i>Ricanstruction: The Black Rosary</i>. If you haven't heard this, it contains a Big Pun verse you haven't heard. You're welcome.\n\nHe's worked with some of the spitters and producers in the game and has a catalog filled with so many flame emojis that it's easy to lose count after a few tracks.\n\nHere is his classic 1996 debut, in all its glory. If you're into it, go check his catalog on your streaming platform of choice.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/edBvqgIaDoY",

    "content_html": "[dropcap]S[/dropcap]ometimes it takes a single wake-up call to persuade someone to get up and follow their dreams. For me, it was the birth of my first daughter and a health scare that recently changed my outlook on everything. For Rob Markman, head of artist relations at Genius, it was almost being shot at 18-years-old— an experience captured on his unexpected and amazing new EP, <i>Write To Dream</i>.\n\nRob has spent years meticulously breaking down bars by your fav rapper's fav rappers, so after he had announced his album earlier this month on Sway, you can imagine that heads had high expectations. To the same degree, you'd like to think that a dentist would have great teeth.\n\nDid Rob deliver?\n\nIn a word, yes. This EP is an inspiring celebration of not only Rob — who has turned a dream of putting a project of this caliber together into reality — but also just good music. The production and the bars are on point. Particularly, Rob's storytelling game is A1.\n\nObvious standouts for me were \"Fredo,\" which is a built upon on the relationship between Vito's children in the iconic <i>Godfather</i> films, and \"Jason's Lyric.\" The latter is one of the most creative records I've heard in a long time. I was drawn into the song's storyline, but the climax instantly clued me into the fact that it's a flipped perspective of The Notorious B.I.G's \"Somebody's Gotta Die\"; the reveal almost felt like the first time I watched <i>Usual Suspects</i>.\n\nAnother big tune was \"Writer,\" which cleverly allowed Rob to remind you of how well respected — and connected — he is, without having any actual (rapping) features. As less of a story, and more of a line for lins joint, the opening bars affirm that drive that has existed all along; he just needed to find the right way to make the jump from media to subject tastefully.\n\n<i>\"I don't know what the fuck you thought, I want the crown too/Couple jewels and plaques, shit that sounds cool/You hear the hunger, growl loud when I'm 'round food/And 'round you I'm like Canibus, round two.\"\n<b> —Rob Markman (\"Writer\")</b></i>\n\nRob's writing is seasoned — as it should be. He's spent more time than most of us as a disciple of this culture. Write To Dream doesn't follow any trends or attempt to break any cross-genre barriers. It's just bars and beats, and it's a beautiful thing.",

Earlier this year, I had the opportunity to interview the iconic Wu-Tang Clan member; the following was an unreleased portion of our conversation, which I'm sharing in honor of the project's anniversary.\n--\n\"When I think about records like <em>Only Built 4 Cuban Linx</em>, I think [people] loved it because they didn't have to rewind or fast forward,\" Rae told me while discussing his debut's impending 22nd anniversary. \"You could just play it right through and be comfortable ... to me, that's a trait that defines classic music. When you can sit in the car, listen to it and be like, 'Damn, I didn't have to touch it or keep fucking with the records' ... you can just let it bang.\"\n\n\"It's just well-rounded,\" he continued, discussing the album's overall composition. \"To me, that's what represents a great album, when it's well rounded. You're giving everybody a piece of you, and everybody can appreciate the sequencing, the composing, the skits, the funniness, the happiness, the emotion.\"\n\nOne of the most charming things about <em>OBFCL </em>is that, while the singles were massive, the project truly came together with a cohesive listen. \"I think I was always designed to make albums anyway, and not just sit on singles,\" Rae said with a laugh. \"When it came to <em>Cuban Linx</em>, it had dope singles on there, but it was the album that made it a classic.\"\n\n\"Look at the cleverness, the wow, the fun, the emotions, and the seriousness. I feel like that's what makes you have a classic; when you're able to give everybody all of that at one time, and not just keep doing the same shit. That's my definition of it, but you know, it's all about the music, man. You've got to make music people can relate to, and give them the best of you.\"\n\n\"If they feel that it's a classic, <em>that's</em> all that counts.\"\n\nYou can <a href=\"http://exclaim.ca/music/article/grown_raekwon_drops_classic_in_my_eyes_solo_album_the_wild\">read my original interview with Rae, here</a>.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wF0ry_aDPNw\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hhVTTLOmggs",

    "content_html": "[dropcap]S[/dropcap]tate College, Pennsylvania, rapper Meechi Blanco has been on my radar for a minute. After he had sent me a physical copy of his impressive first project, <em>Good</em>, I began to watch his movements in anticipation of what's next.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2jhT-GTXvSM\n\nThat follow-up, <em>Monday</em>, looks to be just around the corner, and his appetizer \"Braggy McBraggington\" is a good sign of what he's been cooking up. \"The whole idea behind the song was just like, everybody's got a little bragginess in them — and it was just letting it out ... I feel like that's a good thing, I feel like that's something that people should do,\" Meechi tells AAHH.\n\"[The song] is just me telling people to be confident in yourself, do what you want to do, brag about it,\" he continues. \"Because, if you're not going to brag about it, nobody else is going to brag about it for you, you know what I mean?\"\n\nOne of the coolest things about Meechi is the thought process behind his projects; it always comes from a good place. \"Everybody's like, 'Yeah, I hate Mondays' ... I'm always trying to bring people up,\" he explains when asked about the mantra for the upcoming project. \"Even I get depressed sometimes. The point [of my music] is to bring people up, and make people feel good about themselves, and be happy, so I wanted to make Mondays be a positive thing — have people are looking forward to Mondays.\"\n<blockquote>\"It's important to me to be an individual, and for people like me to see what I'm doing, you know what I mean?\" — Meechi Blanco</blockquote>\nHe takes the concept a step farther, too. \"I only drop songs on Mondays, and all my videos come out on Mondays. Anything I do is on a Monday, just to like, brighten people's day on Mondays.\"\n\"My first project, Good, got a lot better response than I thought it would,\" says Meechi, \"so, I put a lot of pressure on myself to outdo it, and do something better. But, when I say 'do something better,' I've gotten to the point where I'm not just trying to out-rap anybody. I feel like I can out-rap anybody, but that's not what I'm going for,\" he explains confidently.\n\"What I'm going for is to create my [own] niche, create my lane, and my sound; I want to have something that's individualistic,\" he continues. \"I don't care about the number of fans I gain; I just want the fans I do have to be like really dedicated and to feel what I'm doing.\"\n\nUltimately, though, his confidence in what he's doing is driving him forward. \"I feel like it takes the right people to hear you; just getting your music in front of the right ears. After that, I mean as long as it's good, it's going to grow and spread.\"\n\nWhile we wait for <em>Monday</em>, check out the latest visual, \"Braggy McBraggington,\" below.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ycan6i_JpBw",

    "content_html": "[dropcap]I[/dropcap]t’s dependent on the ear of the music listener, but instrumental albums — for me — are incredible. I think the sheer ability to carry along listeners without vocal accompaniment is a feat in itself, especially when you’re reaching a Hip Hop audience. Acts like Dilla, for example, make it easy for listeners to nod along to the soulful bass chops; but it takes a more adventurous producer and listener relationship to go outside the box on some new-age exploration. Enter Han Sino.\n\nBased in France — just outside of Paris — he’s taking a blend of new-soul, jazz, 90’s Hip Hop, and spoken word aesthetic and creating some interesting LPs. His latest, <i>Glucose</i>, is a wealth of sounds, vibes, and emotions that make for a dope soundtrack to metropolitan movements.\n\nFans of acts like Madlib or the like will definitely vibe along with Han along the entirety of the twelve songs on the instrumental project; although I sometimes find it hard to write about instrumental projects, I'll give you my best interpretation of my personal experience with this new-jazz gem of s project.\n\n<i>Glucose</i> is – at once – ambient, cohesive, fresh and (at points) aggressively digital. I gave it two full in depth play-throughs.\n\nThe first was during a daytime jaunt through my city's Chinatown during an abnormally busy time of day. The ambient vocals, provided by Han himself, among the chunky bass on “Arabesque,” and the jazzy vibe blended with the almost atmospheric strings of “Colors” made for a trippy, cinematic soundtrack.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/WLm2xtv9_bU\n \nThere seems to be a common element I found in the core bass lines throughout that created this kind of continuous flow through out the whole LP. At a few points, I was so immersed in the experience that I hadn’t noticed that the transitions were new songs all together.\n\nMy second listen was during a nighttime run, which gave the album a completely different feel. This time the latter half of the project spoke to me more; I found myself going back to “Purple Doves,” with its underlying chime that put me in mind of the intro to Run DMC's “Jam Master Jay.” “Deeply Sleepin'” also stood out to me way more on my second listen.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/BDh8g1p3Ddg\n \nHan Sino has a unique vibe that I’m not quite used to – yet. With a Paris state of mind and unique yet oddly comfortable take on rare jazzy groove, he puts my mind in a good space. If you’re at all creative in any capacity beyond music, I urge you a to add this cat to your getting shit done playlist; satisfaction guaranteed.\n\nYou can bump the whole LP, <a href=\"http://‪http://hansino.bandcamp.com/album/glucose‬\">here</a>.",

    "content_html": "[dropcap]I[/dropcap]n a lane that was once dominated by Combat Jack, there is now a ton of traffic — and it's a beautiful thing. Over the few years, we've seen some of the game's best story tellers emerge as podcast hosts, commentating and sharing incredible background stories and insight that real heads have been losing their minds over.\n\nIf it seems like podcasts are now the biggest thing in Hip Hop, well, they are. If you feel left out for not being up on them, there's no need to worry. It may seem daunting — but it's nothing that a little guidance can't fix. I've rounded up a few of the podcasts that I'm currently obsessed with, below, and pointed out my fav moments thus far.\n\nAs far as Hip Hop stories go, this summer has been filled with some pretty amazing Podcast moments; so, play catch-up now, while you still can.\n\n<hr />\n\n<h2>In Real Life</h2>\nAngie Martinez and Minya Oh — better known as Miss Info — have been in the game for a minute. Longtime friends, both former Hot 97 on-air personalities, authors, and mothers, they share an interesting dynamic on their new podcast In Real Life. Mostly improvised, and rarely following any prescribed order, they candidly approach topics that range from life to music from a woman's perspective.\n\nIt has the appeal of two homies having a casual convo over lunch. Their passion for the culture, deep knowledge — and interpersonal relationships — with the artists they discuss makes for a solid listen.\n\n<strong>Fav moment thus far:\n</strong>\nI truly appreciated and enjoyed the way they chose to approach the passing of Prodigy during their second episode. Their relationships with him shine through and result in thoughtful insight.\n\nCheck it out, below.\n<div class=\"tidal-embed\" data-type=\"t\" data-id=\"75663873\"></div>\n<script src=\"https://embed.tidal.com/tidal-embed.js\"></script>\n<h2>Drink Champs</h2>\nIn many ways, Drink Champs, hosted by N.O.R.E and DJ EFN, has emerged as the front runner among the many podcasts of the day. The premise is genius; N.O and crew get drunk and high while legends in the game spill an egregious amount of tea and share incredible stories that we've never heard before.\n\nThe guests are incredible, but it's also hard to ignore the media personality that Noreaga has become, as well. He often drops sidebar stories — serving as a reminder of the fact that he's also been in this game for years. Often, he also has personal stories and anecdotes that involve the guests, which makes it seem as though you're truly listening in as a group of old droogs get listed and reminisce. A must-listen.\n\n<strong>Fav moment thus far:\n</strong>\nThe latest episode with Wyclef had it all, amazing insight into the classic Canibus vs. LL Cool J battle, insight into how Wu Tang Clan influenced \"Maria Maria\" and a ton of singing.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/9HiGm8dOJHo\n<h2>Stretch & Bobbito</h2>\nStretch and Bob helped to springboard a lot of acts back in the 90s; ironically, though, while incredibly articulate and blessed with incredible guests, they rarely did straight-forward interviews. What’s Good with Stretch & Bobbito, their triumphant return to the \"air\" via NPR podcast series, is the opposite of their classic show on WKCR, with little to no music and all talk.\n\nFour episodes deep, and I'm completely hooked. Guests so far have included comedian Dave Chappelle — along with Donnell Rawlings — Oscar-winning actor Mahershala Ali and best-selling author Eddie Huang.\n\n<strong>Fav moment thus far:\n</strong>\nI enjoyed episode four, with Chance The Rapper as a guest. From parenthood to Hip Hop becoming more \"happy,\" it was an insightful interview; very well put together.\n\n<iframe title=\"NPR embedded audio player\" src=\"https://www.npr.org/player/embed/540673885/542321921\" width=\"100%\" height=\"200\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe>\n<h2>Mogul</h2>\nMogul is an incredible docu-series by the G.O.A.T of this podcast game, Combat Jack. Over six episode, and numerous bonus/supplementary stories, we hear about the life of Chris Lighty, his meteoric rise to the top, and his tragic death — with some incredible stories along the way.\n\nFrom the incredible amount of background to the show's music — which is provided by Prince Paul and Don Newkirk — it's an absolute must listen, and deserving of immense accolades.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/s6yaa987oXQ\n\nHappy listening!",

    "content_html": "[dropcap]S[/dropcap]ometimes an artist is un-sleep-on-able. What do I mean by that? Well, at times in this writing game, an artist gets thrown at you from multiple directions enough that you need to concede eventually, and just go with it. Ard Adz is one such artist.\n\nA UK native, I've given an (unreasonably) cold reception simply for the fact that I am resisting entering the UK market [as a writer]. Admittedly, it's due to a daunting amount of research I need to be up on the scene, beyond those that have boiled to the top, like Skepta and company.\n\nArd Adz, though, is becoming difficult to ignore, with well over 50 million spins on YouTube. More impressive, though, he has over one million Spotify streams. Those in the know understand that Spotify plays are everything in 2017.\n\nI mean, for fuck sakes! Drake, said point blank in an interview that he listens to Adz music.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/twNV2ItVBcY?t=2m10s\n\nHe's 100% independent and unsigned, yet last December, he entered the iTunes Hip Hop/Rap Charts at number 4 with his debut EP, Call Me Dirty -- which is super impressive.\n\nI previously featured his video \"RumPumPum\" in my weekly playlist series, but wanted to double down and share his newest visual, “Went From.” The freestyle clip has Adz speaking on his rap influences, mentioning godfathers of the genre such as B.I.G and Pac, as well as addressing the political crisis and divides between governing parties Labour and Tori.\n\nThis kid is on his way, so sleep is futile! Get up on him!\n\nEarly!\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqH7WVOAtsE\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aMJOVcfbM4\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oD5bQexXAv4\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sy2H1DscGJE\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUJAQk5yXRY",

The New Yorker — born Prosper Mbongue-Muna — earned a healthy base of fans appearing as a cast member on MTV's Are You The One?. \"It was a crazy experience,\" he tells AAHH. \"One of the craziest experiences of my life ... I was chilling with a bunch of beautiful women and got to make some money at the ends, so that's always nice.\"\n\nhttps://youtube.com/watch?v=udhLv-M1mAI\n\nThe experience, aside from putting his face out there, allowed him to leverage red carpet situations, and connect some critical dots. \"It was just a great outlet,\" he continues. \"It was different you know ... it wasn't [really] a 'Hip Hop culture' outlet.\" He quickly adds, \"at the same time my music is more universal.\"\n\nHis music has heaps of crossover appeal. He only just recently popped into my radar with his visual \"Game,\" <a href=\"http://aboveaveragehiphop.com/aahhtop5weekly-top-5-august-4/\">which was included in our #aahhtop5weekly round-up earlier this month</a>. The track, along with his other new track, \"Vice City,\" are both slated to appear on his brand new project, 1991, which — although being touted on blogs as far back as late 1996, is dropping in the next month or so.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rroyBHgxpbY\n\n\"I'm working on a project called 1991,\" Muna explains, \"the year I was born. I'm speaking to the generation, you know, everybody from the nineties, or around that era. Just representing.\"\n\nEyes and ears are definitely on the kid, especially with a track record of opening/sharing stages with big names like Snoop Dogg and 2 Chainz — among others. But pressure is nothing; his dizzying amount of grind is looking like it's about to pay off.\n\n\"I got to shoot a music video [last week] for one of my new songs called Pull Up ... I am very excited about that,\" he tells us. \"Just working man, that's where I'm at right now.\"\n\nSomething is intriguing about his story — which mirrors the all-American Dream. He went to New York with just over $100 in his pocket and a dream of making in this industry.\n\n\"I just want to let people know I'm an artist that's here to stay,\" he tells us before hopping off of the phone call, \"that's what's up.\" He just dropped a remix of the Childish Gambino hit, \"Redbone.\" You can check That out, below. His new video, \"Pull Up,\" drops on September 1st.\n\nhttps://soundcloud.com/p-muna/vice-city-ft-gio/s-ZBtaT\n\nhttps://soundcloud.com/p-muna/redbone-remix",

    "content_html": "[dropcap]W[/dropcap]e've been rocking with Michigan-based rapper AfterPxrty for the past few projects now, and he keeps developing, while staying faithful to the original vibe that drew us in on <em>The Saints Say Amen</em>, which peaked at 16 on iTunes — that's a big deal. After his initial success, he started his imprint, Global Money Group LLC, which already has ten releases under its belt. With a larger platform at stake, I immediately expected something serious from him.\n\nNaturally, without hesitation, I plugged in the aux cable and took a night right to give the homie's project a spin — here's what I thought.\n\n<em>No Rest For The Wicked</em> is an eight-song EP full of big bars and even bigger production. In the past I compared his (very) slightly unorthodox but commanding flow to west coast legend Saafir; I'm doubling down. From the onset of the first track, \"Republic\" — overflowing with video game references intertwined with lamenting about the grind-time he's put in — you know this project is AfterPxrty going Super Saiyan.\n\nWhile the project doesn't venture too far out of the bass-filled pocket he sets up, which gives it a sonic cohesiveness, he does poke his head out a few times. \"Blade - Runner\" stands out with its atmospheric sampled beat, giving him more of a \"rappidy-rap\" soundscape to beat down. Another stand out for me was \"No Rest,\" which I found myself going back to more than twice after my first run-through; the subtle bass switch on the chorus is nasty (for lack of a better term).\n\nhttps://soundcloud.com/apxza/blade-runner/s-XO1rc?in=apxza/sets/no-rest-for-the-wicked/s-IK81n\n\n\"A Million Questions\" comes through with a face-paced beat that sounds like it was stolen off of Meek's latest track list. \"Ask that Eagle why he flies, nigga ... ask that lion why he king, nigga; ask that king about that dream, nigga,\" he states in the chorus.\n\nMissed opportunity: the hottest beat on this project, in my opinion, was the \"Wealthy Street Interlude,\" which he didn't bless at all!\n\nOverall, it's the best we've heard so far from the Grand Rapids rapper; we'll have to keep an eye on this one to see if he can repeat the charting success he had with<em> The Saints Say Amen</em>. Worth a spot on your busy weekend playlist, though.\n\nhttps://soundcloud.com/apxza/sets/no-rest-for-the-wicked/s-IK81n",

    "content_html": "[dropcap]I[/dropcap]'m not ignorant of Dash Machete; the Brooklynite has been on my radar for a minute now -- but, I've been inundated with ... stuff. I have some well-respected writer friends that have given her some pretty serious pen time in some major outlets, and I slumbered. That sleep was abruptly interrupted when I gave her latest EP Jigsaw an honest spin. At only two full tracks, it's an admittedly easy release-day listen, but dripping with goodness.\n\nThe first track, which dropped already, is \"You Don't Know My Name,\" which is a fitting almost taunting title. What I love about h is her cadence; she's Haitian-born, which is probably what I'm hearing. It's just such a unique sound. The track, which kicks off with a piano-driven intro switches up into bouncy almost Neptunsey vibe where she drops bars — following an infectious chorus. \"That's Machete, made of sauce — what are you wearing hater cloth?\"\n\nThe next track, \"Pieces,\" has a UK vibe about it, with a thick baseline and a little vocal chop that she dances around. The song, according to her,\" tells the story of a broken love tale.\"\n\nWhat is hitting me after a few listens is how different her music sounds when compared to the other music I'm being hit with lately. She gives a shit about her lyrical content, and it shows. R&B/Hip Hop/Pop/Electro blends don't always deliver such admirable results.\n\nWith Kelis's third solo-album Tasty being a noteworthy and influential release to her, her differentiating elements make perfect sense.\nI'm on Twitter and seeing nothing but positive feedback following her release party earlier this week — and rightfully so. Jigsaw EP is an excellent introduction to Dash that I'm glad I took it in.\n\nNow I see what the hype was all about! Early.\n\n<iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/playlists/347385117&color=ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false\" width=\"100%\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"no\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe>",

His latest chapter has been his most intriguing; he took what he thought was a two week trip to Seoul for a gig, spiraled into a series of gigs, which eventually resulted in him signing with Sony Asia.\n\nNow -- currently living in Asia -- he's continuing promotion for his latest LP released on the Asian major-label,<em> 14 Hours Ahead</em>, with a gorgeous new visual for \"Overboard,\" one the album's standouts.\n\n\"The music video was shot in Thailand on a boat between Pattaya and Kho Samed,\" Koncept explains. \"Thailand is an amazing place. I wanted the video to be simple and just have clear shots to show you how beautiful this world can be. Being on a boat also fit the song title and theme perfectly.\"\n\nAs he goes on to describe, the track has a few meanings associated with it. \"One [meaning] is an overreaction. It is wise to think before making an action, or even speaking.\n\nSometimes without sitting back and evaluating a situation, people can react to something in the wrong way. Our emotions are strong and can sometimes get the best of us making us act without taking a chance to breathe and think. Therefore, going “overboard.\"\n\"Another meaning,\" he continues, \"is when something or someone has just gone too far, and quite frankly, they need to be thrown “overboard ... It's deciding that the relationship is no longer going to work out.\"\n\nSupport my guy; check out the visual, below, and <a href=\"http://bit.ly/14hoursaheadspotify\">stream the album</a>!\n\n<iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/fiIBgNMaiFc\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe>",

    "content_html": "[dropcap]W[/dropcap]hen an LP is filled with pure honesty, you can hear it in every syllable. That's the case, here.\n\n\"Every line that I wrote I put my whole soul and heart in it,\" laments Brooklynite NoahSoundz on the outro of his latest LP, <i>I'm Home</i>. The super-lyrical Christian rappper's project is his debut release and is — among other things — a testament of his unabashed faith in Christ.\n\n“As a follower of Christ my foundation is built on spreading love and the word of God,\" he says.\n\nThe project, which sits at 15 songs in length, is packed with bars on top of bars. For an LP — at points — overtly coated with undertones of religious faith, it's tasteful, palatable, and incredibly well orchestrated. The closest allusion I can make is to Brother Ali's most recent project; while Ali practices an opposing faith, what they share is an ideology that their projects can put forth their own experiences without telling you <i>how</i> to traverse your spiritual path.\n\nI think the fact that this was his debut project was a shock; it's an incredibly self-aware and we'll-orchestrated project. It's filled with jewels, and beyond displaying the depths of his religious drive, on tracks like \"You Are The Reason\" and \"I'm Home,\" it also just introduces his character and demonstrates his skills on the mic.\n\n\"Miracles of His-Story\" has Noah breaking down an incredibly well-researched — logical — case for the existence of Christ. Definite standout.\n\nWhen it comes to jewels, \"Forgiven\" is about letting go of the pain and harboured resentfulness that acts as an anchor holding us back. It also reveals — as a few of these records do — more insight into his personal life. He's a father of two, and his faith, as is played out on a few tracks, can as a revelation later on in his life. An awakening of you will.\n\nHe also has a woman in his life — presumably the mother of his children. He dedicates three verses to his love for her on \"Heartbeat.\"\n\nNow, BARS-wise, he's at his full strength on \"Rhyme Session,\" where he ferociously asserts his MC status, and my favourite track on the project, \"Touch The Sky,\" where he attacks the manufactured societal norms and media perpetuated ceiling that are holding the youth from reaching their full potential.\n\n\"We are not held hostage by our past,\" Noah told one fan in a Facebook comment on his latest video. This is powerful, and I think is a takeaway from the project, and from his story.\n\nAt the end of the day, this IS a Christian project, which may not make it the right fit for some listeners who prefer their Hip Hop a little more ... gruff. For those who appreciate good music that comes from a pure heart, though, <i>I'm Home</i> is a solid cover to cover project loaded with inspiring bars for the soul!\n\nThe full album drops September 5th. Until then, press play on the first visual from the record — the deep storytelling cut, \"Take Me Away.\"\n\n<iframe style=\"border: none; overflow: hidden;\" src=\"https://www.facebook.com/plugins/video.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2FNoahsoundz%2Fvideos%2F1342303882531978%2F&show_text=1&width=560\" width=\"560\" height=\"532\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe>",

It's safe to say they are odes to his love of women. \"P.A.P.I.\" which has been floating for just over a month has already amassed almost 39k spins on SoundCloud, which it's infectious hook that reminds (only conceptually_ of the Ludacris/Nate Dogg classic \"Area Codes.\" On \"Girls\" he breaks down the flavors of girls he's feeling over the smoothest instrumental I've heard in a while.\n\n<iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/333633952&color=ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false\" width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" frameborder=\"no\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe>\n\nThe saxophone fueled \"Mi Negra\" is a subtle warning to stay the hell away from his girl; the track is a head nodding ode to love.\n\nWhat I've always admired about Xleoniduz is that when he hits me with a pack of records, they all seem to have a cohesive feel. Right down to the cover art, which is super dope, he is a complete package. These latest tracks are the strongest I've heard from him and seem to ooze the most commercial appeal thus far, in my humble opinion.\n\nGive the new tracks a spin, and sty up on the kid! Early.\n\n<iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/338589513&color=ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false\" width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" frameborder=\"no\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe>\n\n<iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/337401911&color=ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false\" width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" frameborder=\"no\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe>",

    "content_html": "Newark, New Jersey' rapper Rugby Wild is definitely in his pocket with his latest single, \"Scuffs.\" A few run throughs of his new video put me in mind of the 90s film Kids — if only just visually. The visual is beaming with an undercurrent of youthful exuberance and that \"last summer before adulthood.\"\n\nBrick City has a long, storied history in the Hip Hop game — from Artifacts and Redman to Queen Latifah and Lords Of The Underground. With a new wave of drill inspired music flooding the tri-state, Rugby Wilds (an acronym for \"regardless of reflection you got to be yourself; whether I live or die\") is a glimpse at what's to come. Not quite as golden era as the past projects from Pro Era, but way more conscious than some of the other acts running through the five boroughs or rolling through Jersey.\n\nHe dropped his first mixtape back in 2012, and his debut album W.I.L.D just last year. \"Scuffs,\" which had a premiere on Noisy, is the first taste of what his upcoming release \"Millennials\" is going to sound like.\n\nGive the new fire a few spins.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9fVtv4yB1ms",

    "content_html": "[dropcap]F[/dropcap]ollowing up on his debut EP, Bronx (New York) rapper ReachingNova is dropping his new body of work this September; <em>It Was What It Was</em> — an eight song odyssey shows his versatility and raw skill. One of the things that instantly becomes apparent when you start bumping Nova is his literal clarity; his vocal cadence is crisp and easy to follow allowing his intricate wordplay to shine while he drops a healthy dose of bars across some solid production.\n\nI had a chance to get my hands on an advanced version of the project; here's what I thought after a few solid listens.\n\nThe project, right off the rip, seems to be a constant battle between elements of right and wrong — at points, he comes across like a veteran OG lamenting on past sins. \"Went to church on Sunday on Monday already sinning,\" he raps on \"Don't Matter.\" The concept of faith comes up a lot, alluding to the fact that whatever dirt the artist may or may not be entangled in, there is a conscience working to counteract and steer him in another direction.\n\nThis relationship with God as a symbol of forgiveness also comes to light in the third verse of \"World So Empty,\" a clear standout on the EP with a big feature from Nas-discovered Def-Jam artist Dave East, who just debuted at #4 on Billboard with his new mixtape. It was great timing on Nova's part.\n\nBut faith aside — the 28-year-old Bronx-native has pretty vicious bars indicative of his environment.\n\nThe overall vibe stays in a pretty consistent sonic pocket with few exceptions. \"UNI\" is an example of him stepping into an entirely different feel for a few minutes -- in a (lyrical) conversation directed at a woman. Another big track is \"Know It's Family,\" which is a heartfelt ode to his closest cohorts; \"I've got people I deeply consider family—that takes loyalty, plenty won't understand it.\"\n\nAn air of honor, confidence, and come-up make <em>It Was What It Was</em> a solid effort from the rapper, who is hailing from the ground-zero of Hip Hop culture. A challenge that many artists from New York City face is keeping it real with the city's history while balancing the new wave that is moving right now -- by which I mean commercially viable. Nova appears to get it!\n\nReachingNova is just that -- reaching new levels.<em> It Was What It Was</em> drops September 18th, which is a great opportunity to get caught up on his old shit! Also -- if you're in the big apple, <a href=\"http://thenovaconcept.com/\">drop by his listening party on the 17th</a>!\n\nEarly.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/PuHqgDN6qe0\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz4v8tHOt7A\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJ6P_H563Zg\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dusA65WOIgU",

    "content_html": "[dropcap]G[/dropcap]immicks come and go; throughout the timeline of Hip Hop, we've seen plenty of names go from artist of the month to obscurity. It's rare to meet artists like Planet Asia who have been consistently—and comfortably—living as an (active) underground recording artist for over 20 years.\n\nHis latest project, a collaborative LP with Detroit producer Apollo Brown entitled <em>Anchovies</em>, is a testament to the phrase keeping it real.\n\nThe two liken their collective brand of Hip Hop to the consistency of a clothing brand like Ralph Lauren, which has far outlived urban competitors over the years. From the raw rhymes to the persistent layer of vinyl pops and hiss, they've managed to give fans the ride they were looking for without switching any lanes—albeit perhaps, a little more minimalist than expected. \"I wouldn't change anything about this project,\" Apollo told AAHH proudly, \"it came out perfect.\"\n\nThough they had worked together in the past, on Apollo's sixth studio album and Apollo's collaborative project with Guilty Simpson, Dice Game, the two never found time to connect on the full-length LP that fans have long desired. \"[The fans] were knocking down my door asking for it,\" Planet Asia notes with a laugh.\n\nPart of the challenge was just logistics, admits Apollo. They needed to pin down the when and where; \"I don't do email albums\" Apollo says. \"[recording together] is the one thing that we have left in the digital age ... to get to see each other's reactions and create together.\"\n\nApollo flew Asia out to Detroit, and the duo spent six days recording material. \"Apollo made it easy,\" says Asia, \"all I had to do was rap. He had all the beats laid out and sequenced for me.\"\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dft5VyzHs0\n\n\"I had a specific sound I wanted for this album,\" Apollo notes. \"I just needed the right MC. I don't work with artists that I need to babysit.\" It's this level of trust in both their abilities that seems to guide the two vets, who have a long track record of one producer/MC collaborative work.\n\nThey both insist that their music doesn't need to subscribe to the current trends that seem to be dominating the consciousness of younger listeners. \"They call what we do niche, but back in the day, they called it mainstream ... that's just where the corporations were at that point,\" says Asia. \"All that shit on the radio now, that shit will last for like a year,\" adds Apollo. \"You can play any of our records twenty years from now because they're timeless.\"\n\n\"Bubble gum always loses its flavor,\" Asia explains, \"this is real ... stick to your ribs music.\" Apollo Brown quickly adds \"there aren't any gimmicks, here.\"\n\nWith a tour in the works, Apollo Brown and Planet Asia are focusing all their pushing the project, which is available everywhere, now.\n\n<iframe style=\"border: 0; width: 400px; height: 472px;\" src=\"https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=3186894325/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/artwork=small/transparent=true/\" width=\"300\" height=\"150\" seamless=\"\"><a href=\"http://apollobrown360.bandcamp.com/album/anchovies\">Anchovies by Apollo Brown & Planet Asia</a></iframe>",

    "content_html": "[dropcap]A [/dropcap]little over two years ago the Hip Hop world was rocked by the tragic and sudden loss of Rapper Sean Price, a member of the Boot Camp Clik, and one-half of the legendary duo Heltah Skeltah — alongside Jahmal Bush, better known as Rock. Finally moving forward (professionally), Rock is making is first post-P foray, <em>Rockness A.P.</em> (After Price), which is--in essence--his first solo-project.\n\n<a href=\"http://aboveaveragehiphop.com/a-conversation-with-rock-of-heltah-skeltah/\">In conversation with AAHH back in 2015</a>, Rock noted that he'd been working on his solo for a while. \"Situations change, the sounds change, my ears change, and the message I may be trying to give the people may change,\" he said.\n\n\"The album is in the process. Life happens though, and right now. I just lost the Yin to my Yang … My brother just died. So, there are changes that need to happen on my album now,\" he added.\n\nHe also shared some kind words and memories about his one-time partner in rhyme. \"As unique as we all are as human beings, I mean, you may find somebody else at some point that reminds you of me, but you won’t find anyone that reminds you of him,\" he said. \"He was one of one – and he chose me [as his partner].\"\n\nNow, two years following that conversation, we're getting a first taste of what the project has to offer, \"Camp-Wu.\" As the name suggests, it's a collaborative track with members of both Wu-Tang Clan (Inspectah Deck and Method Man) and Boot Camp (Tek and Steele).\n\nThe project itself drops on the 22nd and is available through <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/digitaldejavurecords/\">Digital Deja Vu Records</a>.

    "excerpt": null,
    "content_html": "The ongoing back and forth between iconic mixtape DJ and producer, DJ Clue, and NYC radio-mainstay Funkmaster Flex has seen no sign of letting up; and this past week it flared up once again. The Letterman and Leno of Hip Hop radio, the two often have taken very public swipes at each other, with zero chill -- naturally.\n\n“I respect Clue, and Clue’s a good guy, but you know what the thing that he has trouble with? He’s a wack DJ,” Flex recently told ThisIs50’s Winners Circle in a video interview.\n\n“Don’t be coy and your talent is trash. That’s what bothers me about certain DJs. Don’t be coy or cute and you know you can’t handle it.\" he continued. \"And the nigga will never be heard when I’m on that radio. I will look you in your eyes and tell you that. A nigga will never be heard. No nigga has come in that slot and made a name off me.”\n\nClue has since responded, noting \"I would probably try to come at me, too,\" referencing his apparent position in the field. \"It's like when Lavar Ball said he could be Jordan.\" Clue also pointed out that within the last year and a half, Flex had attempted to do parties with him.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JWKziPRmPgc\n\nA ton of (more recent) animosity also seems to stem from the fact that Clue appears to be ducking the battle that Swizz Beats had attempted to set up with the two legends this past March. \"I was under the impression that they wanted to go song for song, and to me, there is no (musical) competition,\" Clue bluntly stated.\n\nWhen interviewer Hynaken noted that Flex was more interested in going back and forth on a DJ tip, Clue dropped another bomb, noting \"he's been doing the same two cuts since I was little.\"\n\nThese are just the latest shots thrown.\n\nBack in 2012, the two had a very public spat over ownership of an exclusive Nicki Minaj track (\"Beez In The Trap.\") Frustration spilled over on-air, with Flex dropping venom.\n\n“I’m so built for this. Listen to me June-June, and you listen to me good. I ain’t hold this crown for so many years for some box-head cornball to get a record tonight that you thought you was gonna get. Now, you just shut up,” Flex said amid NUMEROUS bombs.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVmo9-U4Ixk\n\n“This is not your arena,” he continued. “This radio thing is not your arena. Okay? People sometimes have faith in you because they’re hoping you’ll be the next Flex. I put a stop to that ten years ago. You can’t keep up with me, boy.\"\n\nClue's response was particularly savage; amid calling him an \"old dude,\" he noted \"I know one thing I’m first in, the ratings. [I'm] #1 at Nights 6-10 pm & rated higher 7-12pm. Hold That!\n\nThis was just recent memory, though. Their beef goes way back, as Joe Budden noted on Everyday Struggle last week. \"They've been beefing my whole life,\" Joe said with a laugh.\n\nFor their parts, bot of their positions in the culture is well earned/deserved.\n\nFlex, who was the resident DJ of the iconic tunnel held down NYC and Hip Hop radio throughout (arguably) its height of thoroughness, and continues to knock the competition out the box. He also had highly successful commercial mixtapes and had some respectable production credits under his belt.\n\nClue, a former A&R, basically defined the power and influence of mixtape culture. From leaking records off of Biggie's debut album to helping put artists like Fabolous and Joe Budden into the public sphere through his imprint, he's a pillar of the scene.  The first DJ to go platinum, he also has some major production credits under his belt -- like Mariah Carey's \"Heartbreaker\" for example.\n\nThe staple DJ's of the big apple's two largest stations in the same time slot, beef is inevitable. Especially given Flex's track record of rants that traverse entertaining to downright cringe-worthy (i.e., Flex vs. Bow Wow).\n\nGiven the recent events, we took to our Twitter, and let the fans decide who they were rocking with, more.\n\n<strong>Here's how it went:</strong>\n\nhttps://twitter.com/AboveAverageHH/status/908359215567261697\n\nAfter two days, the answer was surprising: Flex. Despite his reputation for talking almost eclipsing everything else, fans still prefer his brand of Coke over Clue's Pepsi.",

I get a LOT of music stuffed in my inbox, and I've been loafing, but this kid, Dash Flash, has a lot going for him.\n\nI first came across him while putting together my weekly playlists earlier this year. I stumbled upon his Young Lito assisted \"Go,\" and immediately dug into his other joints on his website, \"My City\" featuring YungViceCity and \"Bad News.\" From there I found his Soundcloud and bumped his EP.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbA12JL0FWs\n \nWith the level of undercover signees building a narrative around their \"come up,\" I've been following Dash Flash's rise carefully -- just based on the great features he was landing -- like Lil' Wayne, Rich The Kid, and the Pink Panther himself, Riff Raff.\n\nHowever, it's organic as they come. This kid is moving, and as of this past August, he's officially in the game (frfr).\n\nhttps://twitter.com/DashFlaSh/status/896762663858044928\n\nWith a newly minted digital distribution deal with California-based Empire Distribution, which distributed such game-changing singles as \"Look at Me\" by XXXTENTACION, \"All the Way Up\" by Fat Joe & Remy Ma, \"Broccoli\" by D.R.A.M., and \"Flex (Ooh, Ooh, Ooh)\" by Rich Homie Quan, he's on his way to great things.\n\nNext up? A brand new visual alongside Miami-based Zoey Dollaz, which he's been teasing on his Twitter profile.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/DashFlaSh/status/910313681845673985\n\nI've been holding back on this kid, but that stops here. Dash Flash is in the group of next up. He's worked with some of the best in the business, and with new distribution in place, it's only a matter of time before he bubbles over into the mainstream.\n\nEarly!\n\nhttps://twitter.com/DashFlaSh/status/910687579909099520",

The song—as released—was a stand-out single appeared on Fif’s <i>Get Rich Or Die Trying</i>.\n\nIt’s mind-blowing to think what bars Nas may have dropped on the record that became synonymous with 50’s post-shooting rise to infamy. The song’s storyline sees Fif enacting revenge on the shooters who hit him nine times in front of his grandma’s house and was given life with an equally cinematic visual treatment.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/5D3crqpClPY\n\nThat’s not all, though. Esco also had his hands on Alicia Key’s “You Don’t Know My Name,” a Kanye West-produced song that stands among her top tracks.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/_ST6ZRbhGiA\n\n“Kanye gave that to me for Nas first,’” Nicholson says. “We recorded that in the Bahamas the same day we did ‘Destroy and Rebuild.’ He went down [memory] lane; the track gave him that vibe. It was him and Lord in the studio reminiscing about a bunch of things… he did a sing-songy hook to it. It was an excellent record.”\n\nIt’s crazy to think about these artist’s catalog without these key records, and even crazier to imagine Nas adding them to his.\n\nWe jumped on Serato and decided to see what Nas would sound like on both instrumentals. Check it out, below.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/-KWUcYyWcz0",

    "content_html": "[dropcap]A[/dropcap]no Ba, formerly known as MPYRE, has appeared here on AAHH a few times now; the last time we took a thorough listen to the Chicago alt-rap artist, we broke down his eight-song EP <a href=\"http://aboveaveragehiphop.com/indiefeature-mpyre-two-stock/\"><i>TWO STOCK</i></a>. Now, over a year later, he has a new name, new focus, and a new album on the way.\n\nWhile we wait, he's hit us with a summer-tinged loosey, \"Slide On Me\" produced by New York-based beatsmith Rrarebear. One part early 90s R&B loop, one part melodic vibe, Ano shines with his unique brand of nerd-core, albeit a little less melancholy than some of his usual undertones of mental illness.\n\nHis wordplay is crazy and packed with all types of references, from Pokemon to Carly Rae Jepsen. \"Been off the lean, Imma tilt perspective, get introspective, see your reflection, love your imperfections, that's resurrection,\" he raps, bobbing and weaving on the smooth flow of the instrumental.\n\nFresh off the heated summer season, and as we troop into fall, the song is a perfect addition to your movement music playlist. Give it a spin.\n\nUno.\n\nhttps://soundcloud.com/itanoba/slide-on-me\n\nhttp://aboveaveragehiphop.com/indiefeature-mpyre-two-stock/",

    "content_html": "[dropcap]I[/dropcap]'ve been pulling together these weekly playlists, but I wanted to do something different this week. I wanted to start a new series for a few weeks to shine some light of the female emcees that have been getting a crazy amount of burn on my iPhone. Special shout out to everyone who's been sharing your top picks with me on Twitter -- I see you!\n\nAll five of these ladies should be on your radar -- if they aren't already.\n\n<strong>Suni MF Solomon</strong>\n\nI’ve been showing love to this ATL upstart for a little while now, but she needs a spot on your playlist and way more credit than she’s currently getting, frfr. All her music a certain energy about it that just draws me in — I can’t explain it, but if she’s dropping I’m coppin. She has a cool look, tons of high-quality videos, and bars (on bars). Recommended listening to get you started are “Fake Atlanta Shit” and her remake of Queen Latifah’s “Just Another Day.” Press play.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUkb-j-ID4c&t=14s\n\n<strong>Nezi Momodu</strong>\n\nOk, so when I asked my followers to help me out with the hottest female artists out right now, I legit got about 100 tweets telling me that I’m dumb for not automatically thinking of Nezi Momodu; she’s one part poet, one part singer, and one part cypher ready Emcee. Her debut LP seasons is a little of everything, and a super cool cover to cover listen — don’t let the 27-song track-list scare you away. Check out one of my fave tracks on the project.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=18Ir1u94vWQ\n\n<strong>Mosca Flux</strong>\n\nMosca Flux is a hustler, real talk. She wears many hats as a model, seasoned event host — shit, even a talk show host. But, she’s super nice with this Hip Hop music, too. The North Carolina-based rapper is savage in a cypher, and has this raw energy about her; you can<a href=\"http://aboveaveragehiphop.com/flux-with-me-an-interview-with-mosca-flux/\"> check out the interview I did with her</a> a while back to learn a little more about what’s she’s all about, and take a look at one of her latest visuals.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_IPA5zWSIE\n\n<strong>Gavlyn</strong>\n\nGav is far from underrated, but far from fully appreciated. She tours the world dropping bars dripping with that Hip Hop swag the older heads like me grew up on. She also has this deep and (slightly) raspy delivery that stands out on top of her impeccable ear for beats. She’s a cool, Hip Hop loving weed head that deserves some spins. Her catalog is hella nice, too. Give her a spin — and check this <a href=\"http://aboveaveragehiphop.com/gavlyn-only-five-feet-tall-rising-high-as-hell/\">OG interview I did with her</a>.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBfa7PiQMD4\n\n<strong>Rico Nasty</strong>\n\nThis young DMV artist has so much star potential -- it's nuts. I first came across her after she sat down with Genius to chat about her track \"Poppin,\" which surpassed a million spins on Spotify (the place where it matters most). I've since been keeping an eye on what she's been up to. If you're not up on her, definitely check her out; she's part of that new class that exists on the cusp of going to the next (next) level.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-jeCRqnDqBc",

    "content_html": "<blockquote>\"I'm appreciating everything that's happening ... I appreciate this very moment.\"--Kota The Friend</blockquote>\n[dropcap]I[/dropcap]f you haven't yet heard of Kota The Friend, you can be forgiven. After all, his debut release <em>Palm Tree Liquor</em> is just over a year old; he's the equivalent of discovering a new show right as the second season premiere. That second in this case is his new EP <em>Paloma Beach</em>, which has been heralded by all who have come across it. The rapper's sound is jazzy and as New York, as it gets -- without overtly mimicking the golden era -- and he has this commanding, yet relaxed tone that makes his music a pleasure to digest.\n\nAs of late, he's been picking up a ton of steam -- culminating in a 2017 A3C mainstage performance on a bill that included Nas. A one-time cinematographer (having worked on videos for acts like Asher Roth and Blu), one of the most intriguing about him is his visual aura. \"Every visual that you've ever seen was -- conceptually -- something that I cooked up,\" Kota told AAHH. \"Most of the time, I just prop up my camera, and I just record a lot of what you see ... one hundred percent of that is me.\"\n\nThe conceptual consistency is especially apparent in his Lyrics To Go series -- beginning with episode 3 -- which features him (often solo) staring directly at the camera, as it slowly closes in, while the lyrics are displayed along the bottom. In the episodes that feature others, they either remain unaware or also just stare hauntingly into the camera. It's an insanely intimate visual treatment that is adding to his overall schtick. He's an odd mixture of Chance The Rapper, Isaiah Rashad, and (regarding his overall peaceful likeability) Lil B; he's easy to become a big fan of.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fk-iPfJMaoU\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_GvqCe6Lhg\n\n\"I feel like it's just the musical content and the lyrical content,\" he says when asked what he thinks make him stand out. \"I feel like I'm saying a lot of stuff that people aren't saying ... I’m just being really honest and digging deep into who I am. It’s just a reflecting style.\" This is the mantra of his new project, which navigates themes rooted in mental health. \"I'm reflecting on my life, and I'm trying to dig deeper than anybody has ever done, so that's kind of what I'm going for. At the same time, I'm trying to bring back this jazzy feel to the music, well, to Hip-Hop [really]. I'm trying to bring a jazzy feel to the mainstream.\"\n\nKota is independent -- like <em>really</em> independent. Not \"fake indie\" a phenomenon that seems to be all the rage right now; but, that doesn't mean he won't entertain the idea of branching out to a major. \"I'm willing to do whatever is best for my career right now -- and for my team,\" he says. \"It's never just my decision but we are trying to figure out what's good for us right now and the indie route is allowing us to do a lot of things and have a lot of freedom. If a label came along with a deal and a good opportunity, though, we would take it.\"\n\nHis most recent releases have been the trilogy of visuals for \"Her,\" which is a song that appeared on his debut. \"I just decided to bring it back and give it some new life; I feel like there are a lot of songs on the old project that didn't get a lot of love because I didn't have a lot of popularity at the time. So, I'm trying to breathe new life into that project as well as like give shine to the new project.\"\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNkTjWldyK0\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxRm04j6eI0\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4PCkXItIzp4\n\nWhile he has aspirations of one day reigniting his video production work, he's keeping to his frenzied pace of music -- in fact, he was speaking to us from the studio while in Atlanta [for A3C].\n\nMostly, he's keeping active -- and his love of what he's doing is shining through. \"I'm enjoying the ride. I'm enjoying where I’m at right now, [because] I know in a couple of years it's not going to be the same ... it’s going to be a completely different situation cause the way that we're grinding is insane. There are a lot of people that are waking up, and I'm just happy to be exactly where I'm at right now.\"",

    "content_html": "[dropcap]O[/dropcap]ne part MF DOOM, one part living breathing Anime story line, Southwest Miami, rapper Kaiju The Unconquerable is in a lane all his own. A glorified, self-identified nerd, he started rocking stages at comic conventions -- and even has the credit of being the first Hip-Hop artist ever to be featured in Shonen Jump, which has been the (print) ground-zero of all things Manga since it was launch 49 years ago.\n\nKaiju differs from other \"weirdo\" rappers, though -- unlike an act like DOOM, he isn't a character (per say). His songs and his image don't hinge on each other to coexist. I mean, he uses a healthy amount comic and anime references, but no more than your average nerd-core spitter. He thrives on a wave-appropriate trappish vibe.\n\nCase and point is his newest release, \"CYBERPUNK 2050.\" Over a bouncy trap tinged instrumental, he criticizes artists who create fake personas via social media that they can't necessarily live up to in real life. \"I'm the kid with the new option, fans waiting like a shoe dropping,\" he raps amid a laid back, well-paced barrage of straight bars. Like, this kid can rap!\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqmIg4BAicY\n\nWhere the nerdery comes in is his visual treatment. In this case, \"CYBERPUNK 2050\" serves as the sixth installment of an ongoing series of self-directed videos that Kaiju has been dropping over the past year. It's a complicated storyline to explain, buy in this episode; Kaiju has used a portal to the future, and -- to keep it simple -- is engaged in some dope martial arts hijinx that make for an entertaining and engaging 6-minute watch.\n\nArtists are NOT putting this level of original thought process into their shit -- don't @ me!\n\n\"I love embracing who I am that’s why I respect Wu-tang so much,\" he told Lisa Ford Blog last year. \"Because even though they're from the streets, they embraced the fact they were fans of martial arts movies.\" It's easy to make stylistic parallels to the dedication they have to their respective overarching themes.\n\nKaiju has a <a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/cashamill-anime-boy\">great back catalog</a>, with a full-length LP, <a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/cashamill-anime-boy/sets/oni\"><em>ONI</em></a>, and then all the material used for his video series following. It's not clear if there is an actual project lined up that will house records like \"Forbidden\" and \"Note 7\" ( a banger, BTW) and this new one, but get acquainted -- and get ready.\n\nYou're welcome.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqENJ5uwVmE\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qm62d9ElYGA",

    "content_html": "[dropcap]L[/dropcap]ike most kids who grew up in my PJs, my father wasn’t around. To make direct reference to Shaq’s classic CL Smooth featured song, “biological didn’t bother.” Like many youths in the bubble of the golden era of modern Hip Hop was—in many ways—my father figure. It taught me how to dress, respond to social cues that were relevant in my environment, talk to girls, and how to view hegemonic powers that be. Was Hip Hop a perfect parent? No.\n\nIn hindsight, youth from (often) broken homes speaking from their experience to likeminded younger youth was—while sometimes marked with brilliant insights—a blind leading the blind situation. Especially if you factor in commercial influences that may be perpetuating the direction of the content. It took the most dedicated listeners to cut through the bullshit and uncover the life lessons. \n\nPublic Enemy's message of social consciousness became drowned out by gangster shit, sadly.\n\nOne such lesson was fatherhood; my childhood predated my internet usage, so the only time you heard about fatherhood in Hip Hop was when the artist made explicit mention, like Xzibit’s “Foundation” off of his debut album. We didn’t get to see candid footage of an artist’s eye’s twinkling with joy as they embrace their children.\n\nThe culture has undergone many changes stylistically and philosophically, and one has been the emo-tification of Rap. Feelings are OK, and being tough all the time sells but doesn’t resonate as much as sharing your soul. This is why a video of Chance The Rapper, an artist who breaks many molds, unpacking Grammys with his child and then breaking down into tears is so endearing.\n\nThen there’s the video of 6lack, who is a must-listen artist for any of you who have been sleeping, explaining to Erykah Badu how he watched his child be born while she performed a live set at a California music festival.\n\nThe most compelling example, though, has become Dj Khaled. He brings his son everywhere, taking every opportunity possible to proclaim his love publicly and tell his son how beautiful and special he truly is.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/PSh60wlYAZU\n\nThe broken-home narrative was a predominant in Hip Hip, and sadly the intro to Naughty By Nature’s “Ghetto Bastard” is sometimes still the case. But a prerequisite for being an artist no longer includes being street affiliated; perhaps this new generation of overt fatherliness will help mold a generation of men excited to step up and embrace the most rewarding challenge life has in store for them.\n\nAs a father myself, artists like XXXtentacion scare the shit out of me.\n\nI get it, he's an exaggerated manifestation of all the feelings younger listeners may have inside, but he also allegedly beats women. Fredo Santana drank [lean] to the point of Kidney failure. Where are the fathers?\n\nI don't want my daughters looking up to and following the influences of some of these women MCs, and I don't want them thinking that some of these shit-heads are the types of men they should respect and fawn over. But, I bumped Lil Kim's Hardcore and listened to Too $hort, so I recognize the hypocritical nature of my concerns.\n\nRegardless, as a self-described Hip Hop father, I'm going to do my best to steer my kids in a proper direction; all father's who consider the culture important. Perhaps we can--collectively--parent a generation of listeners that know better, demand better, and pay it forward to their children.",

    "content_html": "[dropcap]T[/dropcap]he largest divide between the younger and older generation of Hip Hop artists is the sheer barriers to entry that the OG class had to overcome to become notable names in the industry. In a landscape that predated online streams and even easy-to-set-up studios contained within a MacBook, artists had to work traditional “played out” media streams (radio, physical networking) and print media. Even the ownership of Music was more cumbersome, as the price of a Tidal subscription wasn’t even enough to purchase one album, making music purchasing decisions so strategic.\n\nThis was the climate that birthed my love of Hip Hop as both a listener and—in my pre-journalism days—as an artist. My need to have the newest and greatest music bred an obsession with mixtapes, which I made taping College radio stations in the wee hours of the morning weekly. As a Canadian, I found myself listening to the golden era line-up of Toronto artists who were holding it down, but the lack of industry here was apparent. The “6” was far from on the map to the degree it is today, so any artist with love south of the border was a big deal.\n\nWhile artists were touring and making decent bank, there wasn’t yet a Drake to prove worldwide domination. While there had been a few exports only a handful had managed to blend themselves seamlessly into the playlist of golden era playlist across the border. One of these artists was Saukrates; Big Soxx was the artist who made me want to take this shit serious.\n\nHis record “Hate Runs Deep” remains as one of my fave songs ever.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/-QAPPIPSgyQ\n\nIn 1997, he released an EP called Brick House, which featured verses from Chicago rhymer Common, Juice Crew alumni Masta Ace and “Time's Up” rapper OC. While the rapper suffered label issues, he managed to release a proper debut LP in 1999 and reach a deal with Def Jam by way of GILLA House (owned by Redman) in 2000.\n\nRedman is—and always has been—in my top 3. Seeing Soxx taken under Red's wing, appearing alongside him on Much Music, and on the cover of Pound, was the most inspirational shit ever.\n\n<img src=\"http://aboveaveragehiphop.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/9C28CE07-64CD-4998-8401-1B2587820CEC-1100x825.jpeg\" alt=\"9C28CE07-64CD-4998-8401-1B2587820CEC\" width=\"620\" height=\"465\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-21140\" />\n\n<img src=\"http://aboveaveragehiphop.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/ED1AAA76-3C2A-4AEF-BE9E-40F9D0D8EB95.jpeg\" alt=\"ED1AAA76-3C2A-4AEF-BE9E-40F9D0D8EB95\" width=\"620\" height=\"800\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-21141\" />\n\nIt made me feel like a Toronto artist could earn respect and a decent living for straight up rhyming his ass off—without selling his soul.\n\nSoxx was plagued with setbacks but has still managed to release a super dope body of work, and his production work is also super commendable. If you haven’t given him a full listen, do it; also, if you’d like to get to know him better—check out my interview with him from a few years back.\n\nSalute Big Soxx, an artist who made me wanna do this!\n\nhttps://youtu.be/6fjxAupDHGY",

    "content_html": "[dropcap]A[/dropcap]s the gap between the old school and new school becomes broader and more apparent, so does the necessity for icons like Slick Rick to be honored. On this, the 29th anniversary of his classic Def Jam debut <em>The Great Adventures Of Slick Rick</em>, we thought we'd take a few minutes to help newer/younger fans understand why us \"old heads\" hold Ricky D in such reverence after all these years.\n\nIt's kind of hard for anyone under 25 to conceptualize a time when Hip Hop wasn't a well-oiled machine with multiple touchpoints and sub-genres, but there was a time when it was a lot more ... straightforward, for lack of a better term. Much like Rakim, who came in the game with a level of wordplay that blew people away, Slick Rick -- a member of Dougie Fresh's Get Fresh Crew -- brought a level of storytelling to the genre that has carried forward and created a platform for generations of artists after him to bring that thematic, content-rich song layout to the game.\n\n\"Children's Story\" and \"Mona Lisa\" were marvels on so many levels; the way that Rick switched up his voice to give life to multiple characters, his crystal clear vocals, the friendly/approachable English accent -- it changed the game. His entire debut was full of gems, like \"Moment I Feared,\" which follows Rick on a possibly the most unfortunate series of back to back events ever, or \"Kit,\" where he and the infamous car from Nightrider attempt to find Rick's stolen crown (a reference to bummy impersonators).\n<blockquote>\"I was never the type to say freestyle raps, I usually tell a story, and to do that well I've always had to work things out beforehand.“ -- Slick Rick</blockquote>\nThen there was the letter to the youth of the late 80's \"Hey Young World,\" <a href=\"http://aboveaveragehiphop.com/hey-young-world-the-world-is-yours/\">which I've written about in detail in the past</a>:\n\n\"The average (young) hip-hop head in NYC in the late 80’s, early 90’s lived through some arguably wild shit. 1989–1993 saw the highest crime rates in the history of the city, teen pregnancy levels were at an all-time high, and the effects of the crack epidemic were everywhere. This was the breeding ground for much of the golden era that hip-hop heads revere so much. It was also during this time that Slick Rick addressed the youth of the time with his classic record.\"\n\nRick did suffer some setbacks in the 90s after catching an attempted murder charge for shooting at former bodyguard -- also clipping a bystander in the foot. However, <em>Behind Bars</em>, released during his incarceration, is in my top 50 records ever list, and his <em>Art Of Storytelling</em> LP was a cornerstone of my High School years.\n\nAll that to say, if you were born in the 90s, Rick hasn't done very much for you. However, your fave artist with a storytelling style was likely influenced by another artist who was affected by the greatness of Ricky D. Lets revisit some of our fave cuts from his debut, below.\n\nSalute.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ea-ezolZq5k\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5iZasCzxIX8\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjNTu8jdukA\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=greKNLhdlNw\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GlA3YhSLvzs",

    "content_html": "I'm often fascinated by music that I organically discover, as opposed to music forced down my throat. As fun as commercially viable big-budget music can be, there's something so motivating about an artist that creates because—well—they have to. It's in their DNA.\n\nThis is true for a young MC named WizTheMC, who just over a month ago began plastering the blocks around my office with simple black and posters. I didn't even catch them at first; they were incredibly none eventful. Then the volume and frequency picked up. So I stopped, read one, and proceeded to give the URL a view.\n\nWhat I discovered was a German kid—by way of Cape-town—with a cadence and flow that resembled a mash-up of K'Naan and Chance The Rapper. He was in the 6 now and had no desire to leave. It was this story that drew me in. Why had he decided to come to Canada? Why Toronto?\n\n\"To be honest, I'm not sure why Toronto,\" he told me over a text message. \"I just wanted to leave Germany after I graduated from high school, which was three months ago. I had Canada in my head for some reason, so I Googled it, and Toronto popped up. I read a little about the music scene, and just from word of mouth, I heard that Canadians were very nice people, so I got intrigued.\"\n\n\"And another reason,\" he continued, \"was that a found a cheap flight which didn't make me think twice.\"\n\n<iframe src=\"https://open.spotify.com/embed?uri=spotify%3Aalbum%3A1naNz1OG2WLz4p9I3sNyJl\" width=\"100%\" height=\"380\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe>\n\nWhile in the city he's managed to connect with some local artists, as well as film a few videos.\n\n\"It's the vibe when I walk through the city,\" he explains when I ask him what it is about the city that draws him in. \"A lot of people are more awake, more conscious. I can tell just by the way they walk, look, and act/react to certain situations. People here are lovely; Everywhere I go, I tell them I'm from overseas, and they say WELCOME TO CANADA. I feel like Canadians—maybe especially Torontonians—love the Country and are proud of it.\"\n\nHe also noted the comradery on the music scene. \"Talented artists are intrigued to help each other out and show love -- which is rare in Germany if you don't already know the right people. People smile for no reason here, that's an awesome thing to see. I never experienced so much love in three months.\n\nThis new passion he's found is culminating into a project this coming New Year entitled <em>Overseas</em>. However, he has a colorful catalog of music that I highly recommend. Start with his 11-song <em>Painting Picture</em> project, and go from there.\n\n\"I think I'm gonna be here 'forever,' but eventually I wanna be everywhere,\" he says. \"But, Toronto is my third hometown next to Cape Town, South Africa, and Lüneburg, Germany.\"\n\nFollow your heart, artists.

    "content_html": "[dropcap]I[/dropcap]f we’re keeping it all the way 100, the schtick of rhyming in a car is beyond played out. Whatever “cool” factor it did possess probably decimated after <i>Carpool Karaoke</i> became your mom’s fav thing to share on Facebook. At least that’s what I thought, until I stumbled onto E-Class (21-years-old) and his younger brother Young Poppa (11-years-old). Collectively known as The Hoodies, they’ve taken a stale concept and (with sheer quality bars) spun it into national viral fame.\n\nTo be frank, I haven’t been this excited about a new artist in quite a while—especially not a group. Especially not a group from New York.\n\nTheir chemistry is ridiculous. If their recent appearance on Flex didn’t have you Googling “who the fuck are The Hoodies and why have I been sleeping,” let me help you out with some of their must-watch episodes of <i>In The Whip,</i> their ongoing YouTube series.\n\nFirst up, episode 5; these cats ran through a sneaker scheme, a math scheme, and a fucking cartoon theme so seamlessly I had to watch this shit multiple times to catch the blends.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/s6zp2Mr37LY\n \nNext up, episode 4, which featured a surprise cameo by (perhaps) the only other emcees in recent memory with a back and forth chemistry as thick as these two, Styles P and Jadakiss.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/qM4aoBIEsgc\n \nLastly, Young Poppa flamed one of my fav instrumentals “Banned From TV” in episode 7.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/I5hsQZWTILs\n \nAfter binge-watching their videos, I couldn’t help but wonder what these two had in store. It’s rare to be so acknowledged without any actual songs or traditional videos out. “Mixtape dropping sooner then you think,” E-Class revealed to me. “It’s going to change the whole face of Hip-Hop.”\n\nThe way they tell it, this is in their blood. “I been rapping for almost 12 years now,” says E-Class. “I’ll be 21 in February, and I started at nine on a serious level.”\n\n“Poppa got into rapping at a really young age,” E-Class continued. “I’m talking diapers young. He just loves everything about the culture. He loves NWA, Pac, Nas, and 50 Cent ... he’s an old soul and very intelligent, so he knows how to put words together. Plus, I was a heavy influence on him.”\n\nYoung Poppa doesn’t dispute that last point. “[I’ve] been rapping since I was 4-years-old,” he says. “I came up watching my brother and learning from him.”\n\nThey have an aura of excitement surrounding them; you can just tell this is the calm before the storm. Any doubt of that was washed away when Ellen’s team reached out to the duo—literally on the strength of their videos—and asked them to appear on the show.\n\n“We were in complete shock when they reached out,” E-Class says. “Even though we are passionate and believe in ourselves, we never thought we would be on Ellen ... especially off of our In <i>The Whip series</i>.“\n\nhttps://youtu.be/jO39dT8ZQB0\n \nSince their Ellen appearance and their much-lauded performance on Hot 97 industry heads seem to have the duo under their microscope. “Labels have reached out ... we can’t disclose too much information, but they know we out here killing it.”\n\nWhether or not a bidding war is on the horizon has yet to be seen, but one thing for sure, it’s Hoodie season in more ways than one.\n\n“We have our mixtape <i>Family Business</i> coming out real soon, music videos, and our <i>In The Whip</i> series is still killing the streets. We ain’t going nowhere anytime soon, so get used to hearing The Hoodies.”\n\nhttps://youtu.be/Ax2Wf-WUkOU",

Hunnit Block from Dade County, Florida (by way of Little Haiti), has been <a href=\"http://aboveaveragehiphop.com/sam-krow-connects-with-zoey-dollaz-for-hunnid/\">featured on our site in the past</a>. His single “Hunnit” featuring Zoey Dollaz—who is having serious run right now—and his <em>Black On Black</em> mixtape put him on the map within his local scene, and his upcoming EP <em>Zoe Boy</em> promises to open him up to the world.\n\n“[My sound] is down south blended with the heartbeat of the islands,” he tells AAHH. “My mother was my inspiration. Before she died we listened to music together; then, when she died I used the memory of my mom as my pain reliever—my tranquility place. My anger releaser,” he continues. “That’s when I was motivated to do what I wanted to do in life…to make my mom proud.”\n\n“My influence was the black stars in my neighborhood,” he told us, noting he was musically fuelled by Biggie, Pac, Bob Marley, Michel Martelly, Wyclef and the Fugees, Trick, Uncle Luke, and MMG capo Rick Ross.\n\nHe has a lot to look forward to, especially following the success of “Hunnit” which peaked at 83 on the national DRT charts—and number 8 the indie DRT chart. “[My goal is] to build a legacy, not only for my children but my people,” he says confidently. With a freshman album on deck for 2018 and a major tour in the works, it’s only a matter of time before Sam’s name is mentioned in larger industry circles.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5eitIUBvPs",

    "content_html": "<p style=\"text-align: left;\">[dropcap]B[/dropcap]ack in his original form, Weeknd was a dark mystery wrapped in haunting falsettos. His dark non-descript aura made for a sweet eventual reveal. That initial run came to mind while taking in Splice Sama; however, with a slightly more complicated backstory, I’m not exactly sure how a reveal would play out.</p>\n“[I'm] an inter-dimensional alien from the planet Otherworld,” he explains in his bio, “a small planet that orbits the Earth on a higher dimensional plane where love, art, and music are the catalysts for our existence.”\n\nSo, weird. As is the proposition that he’s discovered and fallen in love with our music. His sole mission is to share his experience through songs and the stories, straight from the heart of Los Angeles, California.\n\nAt this point, it’s really up to you whether you go with it; obviously, I played ball. Huge win. His latest project (which is officially an EP) <i>Dark City Vacation</i> is a brilliantly self-aware and cohesive piece of art. Dripping in a low-maintenance trap vibe, this [ET?] showcases some serious writing chops and understanding of how to ride the same old wave his way.\n\nOff the rip, he hits stride with “Jasmine,” and rides that pocket through the remaining five tracks; highlights here include the ‘I’m with your girl when she’s out’ narrative of “Mia” and the super smooth “Flying,” which is surprisingly focused on (among a few things) perseverance.\n\n“Lost In Space” actually makes the perfect bookend for the project. Overall, his production (handled by blk.MVSK) stays quite constant—you can turn it up and let it rock without any interruptions in the flow of things. Consider it the best kind of even-keeled high.\n\nHe’s not wholly original—but he’s quality. This can and should fit snugly into any playlist you have right now while maintaining a level of allure that keeps you on the hook.We know everything and nothing about this kid.

    "content_html": "[dropcap]T[/dropcap]his past weekend gave 90s heads a reason to be excited; Harlem-legends Ma$e and Cam'ron went toe-to-toe is a full-on rap beef complete with vicious person jabs and insidious claims. But, was it all for the clicks? Their cordial agreeance to disagree and move forward via text (which Cam shared) seems to suggest it was all in good fun -- or was it Ma$e being jabbed for far too long?\n\nTo appreciate the magnitude of the beef, it's vital to understand the actual history these guys have; this wasn't bullshit Twitter beef with a stranger.\n\nBoth Cam and [Murda] Ma$e were members of the often under-celebrated Harlem-based group Children Of The Corn, which included Herb McGruff, Cam's cousin Bloodshed, and the late icon Big L. The group recorded roughly 30 tracks, but were largely derailed as a collective by the death of bloodshed and L. However, by the time that L was murdered in 1999, all the group's members had signed solo-deals and ventured out on their own.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/zMpu-AcP9s0\n\nMa$e was -- without question -- the most successful by the time 1998 rolled around. His debut, <i>Harlem World</i>, topped charts and to date has gone 4-times platinum. It was his label situation with Bad Boy that helped Cam link with Biggie Smalls, who consequently facilitated him inking a deal with  Lance \"Un\" Rivera \"Un\" Rivera. Ma$e also appeared on Cam's first breakout single \"Horse & Carriage,\" and appeared in his visual for “357.”\n\nhttps://youtu.be/DdiHt1iUIrk\n\nFast-forward to 1999, Ma$e retired from rapping to become a Christian pastor. The circumstances surrounding his departure from Harlem (and Hip Hop) were murky for years. The official story that we've come to accept is that Uptown-resident Baby Maine (cousin of incarcerated rapper Max B) ran Ma$e out of Harlem for having relations with his girl. It is captured in the song \"Jealous Guy,\" which Maine saw as extremely disrespectful. So whether or not he was fully committed, the \"finding God\" angle was a front of sorts.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/SYnOxKgNHEM\n\nNow, Cam and Ma$e go way back -- even playing basketball together in High School, but Cam and the Dipset crew have openly talked about Ma$e for years. On wax, you can go back to Cam's biggest album, Come With Me. He spits the following bars on \"I Just Wanna\" about Ma$e's sudden departure: \"I just want him to know/rock them jewels, flash that chrome/It's all good, you can come back home if you want.\"\n\nThat was the nicer acknowledgment. In fact, some of their public comments had been less than flattering; Cam was pretty loose on Instagram Live earlier this year, basically calling a spade a spade, eliciting a response from Ma$e.\n\nhttps://m.youtube.com/watch?v=sBjMWdG_b0U\n\nMost recently, Cam dropped some pretty vicious bars on the opening verse of \"It's Killa\" on <i>The Program</i>:\n\n\"Then I watched him play Pop Lotti against Baby Maine/ At this time I'm moving heroin in Maryland/ They both died, and this nigga turned reverand/ Had the hood hot, FBI and agents 'round/ We need a referee, shit, that shit a flagrant foul.\"\n\nThat brings us to \"The Omen,\" and Cam's (kind of disappointing) \"Dinner Time.\" The fans of us here at AAHH have concluded Ma$e was a clear winner, but -- in all actuality -- Hip Hop won.\n\nIn a week that also saw a new project from Fabolous and Jadakiss, NYC seems to be on a pretty nice run right now. Though neither of these artists is in any state that we could consider a prime, It had heads glued to the net in a fashion similar to the way heads were glued to Hot 97 awaiting a response record in the epic Nas and Jay-Z beef.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/JhYZyee0GR8\n\nhttps://youtu.be/X26e3rK5SSM\n\nAs a 30-something-year-old who got on to Children Of The Corn before these two dropped their other shit -- I believe it was on a Stretch & Bobbito tape I copped as a kid -- this battle was something special for me. I knew that the \"dirt\" they had on each other would be extremely deep, and as a whole, I wasn't disappointed. I found myself saying \"what a time to be alive\" no less than 16 times in the past 48 hours.\n\nWhile the preview for Cam's response included mention of the fact <i>The Program 2</i> is dropping January 1st (making this all seem like a commercial), I still loved it -- for the culture. Ma$e is often written off as a corny rapper, but his shit when quadruple platinum. We all fucked with his music pretty heavy, is tbh <i>Harlem World</i> holds up 20 years later.\n\nThere is plenty of chatter centered on irrelevance, which is sad. These two came up in an era when shit was analog -- no internet, no steams. Just straight up physical sales. Most newer (urban) artists will never know what it feels like sell four million full-length albums. Not singles, ALBUMS. I for one am happy that these cats are still out here. As for Ma$e, even if he fades back into obscurity, at least he can go out with his head a little higher than the last time he dipped.",

I made an edited version of his <i>Gunslinger</i> Mixtape and sent it to him via AOL instant messenger. He was grateful and said if I ever needed anything to contact him.”\n\nhttps://youtu.be/5pSFqOPxrLw\n\nAt first, DL didn’t take the open invitation seriously. “I just thought this was something people say and took a chance and asked him for a verse,” he recalls. “Within two hours I had an email and acappella. I put the verse on my iPod Nano and walked around listening to it for three weeks. We did a song together in 2004, and that blossomed into a cool relationship with the whole crew.”\n\n“I have a song with B Real, Sticky Fingaz, Rockness Monsta and Kool G Rap that will premier on the soundtrack of my next film,” DL says proudly. “Cypress Hill inspired me to make music which eventually turned into a successful film career, so its a trip to even know them.”\n\nAccording to DL, this is his most significant project to date. “It’s my first documentary film; however I do have a series of short documentaries called “Rewind The Scenes” where I look back at the making of some of my biggest music videos,” he explains.\n\n<i>The Haunted Hill Documentary</i> is a must-watch for any Cypress fan; check it out below.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/9ddJGSnpVWo",

I agreed with everything the people were angry about, from the immigration issues to the racist and misogynistic undertones being projected and decided I too was “Unpatriotic.“\n\n“My current emotional state, combined with total empathy for the people, and inspiration from movies and TV shows like They Live, Kill Bill, The Matrix, X-men, The Flash, and Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. would be the catalyst for both the song and the video,” he continues.\n\nThe visual is packed with a unifying call-to-action and a super cinematic treatment. Worth a watch—no doubt! Check it out, below.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/GI52OyqnVwA",

    "content_html": "[dropcap]W[/dropcap]riters like me, A&Rs, and label executives used to be the ultimate gatekeepers to this industry; that was then, this is now. In a new-age of Hip Hop dominated by (seemingly) independent labels, and artists creating massive fan bases outside of the industry system, Spotify has reigned as an ultimate measure of genuine engagement with new music—and the format that big dogs use to generate the most significant percentage of their streaming revenue.\n\nIn this new landscape, Spotify’s Tuma Basa and his world-renowned Rap Caviar playlist have emerged as the premier platform for breaking new acts and dictating the wave of music that will inevitably flood the game.\n\nThis year they took this platform a step further with the introduction of Rap Caviar live, which featured a series of concerts with incredible line-ups, such as the New York show which featured a Dipset reunion that was 13 years in the making.\n\nAs a thank you to their massive fan base, Rap Caviar teased a money phone, which it claimed it would be giving to its top listeners. They made good on the promise and late last month I received my very own money phone, complete with incredibly impressive packaging, and intricate RC emblazoned money.\n\n<img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-21345\" src=\"http://aboveaveragehiphop.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/2DBB967E-FCD6-49DD-9827-A059DAC98B10-1100x825.jpeg\" alt=\"2DBB967E-FCD6-49DD-9827-A059DAC98B10\" width=\"620\" height=\"465\" /> <img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-21346\" src=\"http://aboveaveragehiphop.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/F59C271C-76D6-43C7-80CE-5E0D78BC816A-1100x825.jpeg\" alt=\"F59C271C-76D6-43C7-80CE-5E0D78BC816A\" width=\"620\" height=\"465\" /> <img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-21347\" src=\"http://aboveaveragehiphop.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/16FBBEC3-FB0F-4649-BBAC-26CBF132923A-1100x1467.jpeg\" alt=\"16FBBEC3-FB0F-4649-BBAC-26CBF132923A\" width=\"620\" height=\"827\" /> <img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-21348\" src=\"http://aboveaveragehiphop.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/2CD424B5-30FF-46D9-9CF5-480E5D127D91-1100x1467.jpeg\" alt=\"2CD424B5-30FF-46D9-9CF5-480E5D127D91\" width=\"620\" height=\"827\" /> <img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-21349\" src=\"http://aboveaveragehiphop.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/12048B18-D50D-4C81-AE5C-CB191BACCBCF-1100x825.jpeg\" alt=\"12048B18-D50D-4C81-AE5C-CB191BACCBCF\" width=\"620\" height=\"465\" />\n\nA play on the egregiously opulent trend of holding up stacks of money to your ear—which was harshly criticized by Jay-Z via his latest project—the phone case (yes it’s functional) is a fun way to reward loyalty among listeners.

    "content_html": "[dropcap]Y[/dropcap]esterday (December 21) the world was shocked to hear of the untimely passing of one of the culture's most prominent and crucial historians, Reggie Osse, better known as Combat Jack. His death came just over two months after it was announced that he was diagnosed with colon cancer -- a deadly disease that claimed the lives of 50,260 Americans in 2017 alone (with an additional 135,430 Americans diagnosed this year).\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNss-kYijCI\n \nStarting his career as a legal intern for the storied Def Jam Recordings in 1989, he spent the 90s (up until 2004) as a music attorney, most notably working with Roc-A-Fella Records (among MANY others). He later spent time as the managing editor of The Source Magazine and lent pen game to some (major) blogs -- including his own. It was his podcast though, <i>The Combat Jack Show</i>, that ultimately solidified his place within the culture and helped to pave the lane to brand new industry that has since seen a new wave of strong voices.\n\nThe in-depth interviews that Reggie was able to get on his show, coupled with his well-spoken demeanor and incredible microfiche of Hip Hop knowledge allowed him to -- since launching the show in 2010 -- create a rich archive of stories. These have effectively helped to fill in many gaps in golden era happenings while digging into more contemporary artists and brands pushing the culture forward.\n\nWe've since become acclimatized to a number of (new) staples in the Hip Hop storytelling game, such as DJ EFN and N.O.R.E's <i>Drink Champs </i>(currently airing on Revolt). Reggie, though, set the blueprint.\n\nThe stories were crazy. D-Nice described to Reggie in astonishing detail the events that led to the shooting (and death) of DJ Scott La Rock. John Forte told the story of his rise alongside the Fugees -- and eventual downfall after a massive drug bust. Ice-T gave an excellent first-hand account of how gangsta-rap developed organically in 1980s LA. That, of course, is on top of more guests like J.Cole and Big Krit. The show's seven-year run built up an incredible library that will forever teach and inspire a new generation of both fans and fresh journalistic voices.\n\nFrom the success of <i>The Combat Jack Show</i>, he built an empire, Loud Speakers Network which includes other notable shows like <i>The Brilliant Idiots </i>with Charlamagne Tha God and Andrew Schulz, and (of course) <i>Tax Season </i>with the notorious Tax Stone. His roster boasts 1.2 million listens per month and regular appearances on Apple's Top Podcast Charts.\n\nThis year, he had been riding particularly high after possibly his greatest body of work, Mogul, which was the incredibly detailed life and times of iconic music executive Chris Lighty -- as told by the people that knew him best. Touching on topics such as mental health and domestic abuse, it unbiasedly traversed the good, bad, and ugly in the music industry, while walking listeners through digestible chapters in the life of a man who profoundly steered the most glorious and arguably essential years in the growth of the culture.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qYGw8b5Lp4U\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6yaa987oXQ\n \nIt was, without question, one of the best listening experiences I've personally had in many years.\n\nAs Hip Hop is getting older, we're increasingly being reminded of our mortality. Earlier this year, I had to (sadly) write about the death of Jay “Icepick” Jackson, a producer and A&R who was instrumental in the Ruff Ryders movement, who passed away from prostate cancer. According to Swizz Beatz, who is the Godfather of Jay's son, his final request was that men are made aware of how important it is to see the doctor and check up on their health.\n\nPerhaps -- like Jay -- Reggie can also serve as a reminder that we need to keep a close eye on our health. Scarily enough, 1 in 21 men are at risk of developing colon cancer. If caught  early, about 92% people with stage I colon cancer are given relative 5-year survival rate.\n\nHe will forever serve as the benchmark for Hip Hop journalism that all of us in the game should aspire to achieve. As well, he exuded a level of love and detail that readers and listeners should demand. Reggie's spirit is a tremendous loss for the culture -- he leaves behind four children, many (many) friends and a legacy of fantastic content. Our condolences to all those personally affected by his loss.",

    "content_html": "[dropcap]I[/dropcap]’ve spoken about this in the past, but as a recognized journalist, I get lots of email and attention from artists looking to have some pen game dedicated to their craft. In this daily wave things don’t always stick out to me; It’s impossible for me to listen to everything and respond to everyone, respectfully.\n\nSometimes, though, you just get a feeling.\n\nThat’s what happened when I got a message on Twitter from Steph Dash Nash, a mother, Hip Hop journalist, clothing designer and producer who happened live in my city. She politely asked if she could send me her project, <em>True Grit</em>, which she produced alongside Big Sproxx, a Toronto producer who I knew from his work with the Toronto collective Freedom Writers.\n\nShe sent it over, and I was floored by the guest list that included verses from the likes of Masta Ace, Planet Asia, M.O.P., D.I.T.C. Alumnus O.C., Havoc from Mobb Deep, Ras Kass, and even the late Sean Price among a host of others. In fact, there are two verses from Sean on here, so fans should hop all over it.\n\n<iframe style=\"border: 0; width: 100%; height: 120px;\" src=\"https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=1916600884/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/tracklist=false/artwork=small/track=4107474163/transparent=true/\" width=\"300\" height=\"150\" seamless=\"\"><a href=\"http://supremeultraradio.bandcamp.com/album/true-grit\">TRUE GRIT by Steph Dash Nash presents</a></iframe>\n\nI was immediately intrigued as to how she was able to amass such a respectable list of artists and decided to sit and chat with Steph. Her story, though, was much more profound than I could have imagined and gives a whole new dimension to the project, which I’m comfortable referring to as a pretty timeless collection of fantastic music from some of the artists I grew up idolizing.\n\n“I've always been a lover of music—particularly hip-hop,” Steph tells AAHH. “I grew up in the projects in Toronto after my biological father was killed in a car accident. My family lost everything and had to start over again. And that's where I grew up like I found the community embraced me ... I would just listen to hip-hop all the time.”\n\nHer relationship with producer Big Sproxx began to show her the ropes in the studio, and her production chops began to develop organically. “It just snowballed from there,” she says.\nShe got heavily involved in the podcasting game after various guest appearances. “People were surprised; people were like ‘wow, this girl knows they're a hip-hop.’ From there I started,” she says. She began doing interviews on her platform, Supreme Ultra Radio.\n<blockquote>“I just wanted to keep the culture alive.” —Steph Dash Nash</blockquote>\n“My first interview was with Pete Rock,” she says, “I was nervous as hell, but it came out well. Then I did one with Diamond D; I did one with General Steele, Ken Starr ... a lot of underground artists. I made a lot of the connections—it’s (largely) how I was able to be able to bring the artists together for this album.\"\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xs9HLMZJMEg\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZNCmyDDU2g\n \nThree years ago, she was awarded an Ontario Arts Council grant to help complete album, which she had begun working on it back in 2014, with the hope of releasing it in 2015. However, that timeline didn't pan out as But that didn't pan out as she was diagnosed with Glioblastoma, which is the most aggressive form of cancer that affects the brain initially.\n\n\"It's the same cancer that Gord Downie just passed away from,\" she says. \"It's also the same cancer that Senator Edward Kennedy passed away from -- and the one that Senator John McCain is battling right now as well.\"\n\n\"I had to hold back a little bit, but I was determined,\" she continues. \"I was more than halfway complete the album before I was diagnosed. So I had to put it on hold ... they only gave me anywhere from six to nine months. But I'm going into my eighteen months now. I'm quite the fighter.\"\n\nIn recent months, Steph has become an outspoken advocate for Glioblastoma, which is not only the most aggressive, but most underfunded form of cancer. From speaking live to writing multiple letters to Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, she's highlighting the need for allocated funds for research that could save lives of others -- like herself -- receiving the grim diagnosis.\n\n\"It's [almost] like they feel because the mortality rate is so grim -- that you're going to pass anyway -- that they don't need to expand the necessary resources,\" she explains.\n\n\"I was [recently] invited out to San Francisco; there are two surgeons that I befriended over the last couple years,\" she says. \"They're husband and wife team ... they've been working on a cure since they were nineteen. They're not the only ones. There are very brilliant doctors working on this cure.\"\n\n\"They're trying to get me into a trial out there,\" she continues, \"because out here there is no funding.\"\n\nWith every reason to feel broken, Steph remains a beacon of hope and courage. Though difficult, she pushed to complete True Grit, which served as a motivational factor to help her move forward -- as Hip Hop had often done throughout her life.\n\n\"I just pushed it out and I mean I wanted to do more,\" she says, \"I wanted to have some more songs on it, but I had to be wise as well because I don't know how much time I have -- even though I'm very positive. I have to be realistic too, right?\"\n\n<iframe style=\"border: 0; width: 100%; height: 120px;\" src=\"https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=1916600884/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/tracklist=false/artwork=small/track=3344463206/transparent=true/\" width=\"300\" height=\"150\" seamless=\"\"><a href=\"http://supremeultraradio.bandcamp.com/album/true-grit\">TRUE GRIT by Steph Dash Nash presents</a></iframe>\n\nOne of <em>True Grits'</em> songs was a catalyst for Steph's fighting spirit, \"Strange Fruit\" by O.C. -- a one-time fav rapper who became a close friend. \"Genetics passed down had that domino effect, but I refuse to accept...push to break the cycle even if it takes my life -- or a lifetime to rewrite the rules,\" he raps over the head nodding boom-bap sample.\n\n\"This song has assisted me with fighting this monster that invaded my brain. I guess you could call it my 'Rocky Anthem' to continue fighting,\" she told writer <a href=\"https://hypefreshmag.com/hf-exclusive-interviews/exclusive-my-dear-friend-esteemed-colleague-steph-nash-shares-her-story-of-living-with-glioblastoma-the-rise-of-5g-networks\">Mike Cook of Hype Fresh Mag</a> back in September.\n\nListen to <em>True Grit</em> <a href=\"https://supremeultraradio.bandcamp.com/releases\">here</a>, and be sure to follow Steph's journey on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/StephDashNash\">Twitter </a>and <a href=\"https://www.google.ca/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0ahUKEwipvMvOubzYAhUl4YMKHXBWCKUQFggqMAA&url=https%3A%2F%2Fmedium.com%2F%40stephdashnash&usg=AOvVaw2DIj61CHnXEsAm6yyzjIrs\">Medium</a>.",

    "content_html": "[dropcap]B[/dropcap]y now you’ve seen and heard the throwback magic that is Bruno Mars’ “Finesse” remix featuring Cardi B. After a fantastic start to 2018 — being inducted into the elite group of artists to have their first three Billboard Hot 100 hits in the top 10 — many detractors are beginning to come around. Including me, to be honest.\n\nIt’s also given more fire to the Nicki Minaj is washed, and Cardi is (in fact) the new queen argument. Seven years of accolades aside, it’s hard to argue that she isn’t running shit at this moment. Nicki must feel some sense of competition, clearly, as her work ethic over the past few months has been hectic.\n\nThe question is, though, why does Cardi’s success automatically mean Nicki is washed? Without a defined head to head competition up for public judging, why does it feel like we can only have one female rapper in the spotlight. Let me clarify; there are LOTS of talented female artists out right now. But not many that are moonwalking across a mainstream plateau as high as Nicki and Cardi are currently.\n\nWe don’t do this to male artists. Well, we do, but not like this. In fact, I’d argue in the sea of extreme similarities and arguable mediocrity, and we give a lot of males artists a pass to shine in the same sky.\n\nI think that perhaps I started to wrap my mind around this after hearing this mega-mix that melded a host of female artists on the “Finesse” instrumental. Nicki and Cardi back to back sound phenomenal. Like, the fact they aren’t putting together a collaborative EP — or at least a legit collabo (not a forced one like “Motorsport”) is a missed opportunity for Hip Hop in my humblest opinion. The fact that Kim and Foxy never did that was a missed opportunity for Hip Hop.\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dzfk6fSb5hM\n \nThis isn’t Highlander. There can be more than one. Stop gassing up bullshit. Hip Hop is a competitive culture, but sometimes we just want to have fun, too.\n\nHopefully, 2018 will be the year that some of the most prominent female acts — again I’m squarely aiming this criticism at significant acts — can start forming super groups and collaborating like some of their male counterparts.",

    "content_html": "[dropcap]I[/dropcap] asked artists to submit for potential inclusion in the new crowd-sourced iteration of my #indiespotlight column. One artist, Shane Eagle was recommended — and almost immediately the suggestion was co-signed by nearly 100 supporters. It didn’t go unnoticed, and I gave his debut release <i>Yellow</i> a listen. Flame emojis in abundance.\n\nI think what I found most surprising after listening to his incredibly accessible LP was that he was from Africa, which I discovered while attempting to set up a phone call. “I was born in the east of Johannesburg, South Africa to an African Mother and an Irish Father,” he explained to me via email. “Growing up, I had two very different perspectives of the world and how it worked because I would spend my time bouncing between the suburbs of Johannesburg to be with my dad and Rabie Ridge which is a small township in East of Johannesburg to be with my mom and most of my friends.”\n\n“It made my childhood dope because from a young age I was able to learn how to move in different surroundings,” he says.\n\n<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-21508\" src=\"http://aboveaveragehiphop.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/6C1F63E6-223B-44A6-B2DC-5F9E84B3BE1F.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"900\" height=\"600\" />\n\n“Hip Hop has always been a part of me and my surroundings growing up,” he notes, “but, I started taking rap as an art seriously when I was about 13 years old.”\n\n<i>Yellow</i> shows an eclectic range of sounds, and positions him as in both in tune with the current wave of Hip Hop dominating generation next and as a lyricist capable of manhandling jazzy 90s Boom Bap. “I worked on <i>Yellow</i> for about a year and half,” he says. “[I was] finding the right way to get my message across and represent myself as accurately as possible — because it is my debut album, it's the introduction of me to the world.”\n<blockquote>“I blocked out everything that was happening around me at the time and made the music that I wanted to make.” — Shane Eagle</blockquote>\n“Majority of the album is produced by Shooter Khumz, who is the in-house producer at Eagle Entertainment,” he points out. “He produced 11 out of the 13 tracks, with the other 2 songs being produced by Tay Beats, a talented producer from Zimbabwe. I like to work with people when things are organic, thats why we only have the one feature on the album, KLY.”\n\nThe most important part of the puzzle though, is that his fan base is super active, and hold him down. As a result, he's making money, charting on SA radio, and is on a trajectory for big things.\n\n<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-21507\" src=\"http://aboveaveragehiphop.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/D3FC089F-B646-4356-8CCC-BEB0A5B49CD9.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"900\" height=\"600\" />\n\n“The impact <i>Yellow</i> has had on people has been humbling and feels like a huge blessing,” he admits. “I love my fans. Together we’re going to grow and dominate everything.”\n\nHis company, Eagle Entertainment, are currently working on <i>The Yellow Tour</i>, which is scheduled to start this year. Apart from that, he’s working towards another body of work. One thing is clear, this is only the beginning for the buzzing South African rhymer.\n\n“I want to be best at what I do across the globe,” he says. “I want to bring Africa to the world in a way that hasn't happened yet.”\n\nhttps://youtu.be/BvSfmpqvGmg\n\nhttps://youtu.be/qClgtgyd90Q\n\nhttps://youtu.be/4CcZfORe2OY",

The super lyrical one Ras Kass — who just last month dropped <em>Year End Closeout</em>, a dope playlist of new music — and MC El Gant has joined forces with producer J57 of the Brown Bag All-Stars to form Jamo Gang.\n\nNOW, to be clear this isn’t left field; DJ Premier dropped a teaser video co-signing the trio last year around this time, and a few loosies were dropped, but a full project failed to materialize until now.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/L5k65H6Lvkg\n\nhttps://youtu.be/ILIcGNetgoA\n \nEarlier this week they dropped the first leak from their self-titled EP via HipHopDX, and — as expected — it’s a bucket of flame emojis.\n\nI’m a huge fan of all three of these guys; Gant and Ras have worked together a few times, and I’ve always thought they’d sound great with a more substantial more focused body of work. I’m also still here for single producer projects, and J57, who is so dope that cats fully couldn’t distinguish some of his beats from Premier (who he worked with heavily at one point), is the icing on the cake.\n\nhttps://youtube.com/watch?v=DMEcGT2venc\n \nThe <i>Jamo Gang</i> EP is expected to arrive on 1-30-18 and comes with a bonus track from DJ Premier.\n\n<b>RELATED:</b> <a href=\"http://aboveaveragehiphop.com/interview-rapperproducer-j57/\">Read My OG Interview With J57</a>\n\n<iframe style=\"border: 0; width: 100%; height: 120px;\" src=\"https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/track=269096860/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/tracklist=false/artwork=small/transparent=true/\" width=\"300\" height=\"150\" seamless=\"\"><a href=\"http://jamogang.bandcamp.com/track/all-eyes-on-us-feat-deejay-element-prod-by-j57\">All Eyes on Us feat.

    "content_html": "Photo credit:<a href=\"http://www.twitter.com/karlyshoots\"> @karlyshoots</a>\n\n<hr />\n\n[dropcap]W[/dropcap]hether or not you agree or even fuck with this new wave of artists flooding the industry, they’re here to stay — and they’re doing numbers. The ascent has been pretty steady, which I think many may not realize. Thriving in a generation that started sharing the dankest of the dank memes by the time they were in high school, they’ve turned consistent grind and work ethic via services like SoundCloud into vehicles to propel themselves to Billboard fame, selling out shows and making racks (and racks).\n\nIn the thick of it all is Ecuadorian DJ and producer Diablo, a 21-year-old LA-based Florida transplant. His close friendships with some acts like Lil Pump and Wifisfuneral has afforded him an impressive catalog of production credits and, well, a pretty awesome life.\n\nCurrently, he’s been seen rocking across the country with Pump, whose “Gucci Gang” has spent 17 weeks on Billboard’s Hot 100, peaking #3.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/diablosucks/status/925846962598846465\n\n“I started seriously getting into [music] production around 15,” he tells me, “but, I always had a passion for music.”\n\nHis first notable placement was with his good friend Wifisfuneral, a south Florida rapper who (first) gained widespread critical acclaim with the release of \"<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-mBCaCe6QQw\">Light-Skinned Trick Daddy</a>\" back in 2014, and (just last year) at SXSW, signed a major label deal with Interscope/Alamo Records. “[I] Love that guy,” Diablo says. “He’s gonna blow up ... feels insane to see that hard work pays off.”\n\n“What’s crazy is most of these artists are good friends of mine, so when I see my brothers succeed it brings me happiness,” he continues. “I’m just happy that I get a chance to work with such diverse musicians.”\n\nTo date, Diablo’s biggest song out is his collaboration with Lil Pump, “Boss,” which went Gold, and is about to certify Platinum.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/pigsandplans/status/940804872894668800\n\n“I was already traveling back and forth so much I said 'fuck it imma move here,'” he tells me about his recent (quasi-permanent) move to LA from Florida. “Not to mention, it’s a dope environment, and it keeps me creative and motivated.”\n\n“[The scene] is bigger, and it’s getting more attention, which is dope,” he notes. But, he seems most grateful for the opportunity to be in the epicenter of the game’s current wave. “I’m glad I get to be apart of such fascinating time in music and hip-hop history,” he says proudly.\n\nHe’s been touring with Pump et al., for the last little while, but 2018, he’s planning on taking things to the next level. “I’m going to release an album with insane production and features,” he tells me. “I’ll also be playing more live shows this year — and festivals. A lot more collaborations, and consistent music.”\n\nhttps://twitter.com/diablosucks/status/932764730753765377\n\n“This year is all about working with as many artists as I can and expanding as an artist,” he says at the conclusion of our chat. “Shout out to all my brothas Pump, Craig Xen, Smokepurpp, Wifi, Trunks, and Ski Mask ... everyone has such a bright future to come.”\n\nWith this much under their belts — and all under 25 — it’s hard not to see Diablo’s vision. I mean, according to this Twitter post, he co-produced a song with Diplo called \"Illuminati\" for Ski Mask featuring Lil Yachty. 2018 is off to a great start!\n\n \n\nhttps://twitter.com/diablosucks/status/941450816665374721\n\nhttps://twitter.com/diablosucks/status/933857655709425664",

    "content_html": "[dropcap]1[/dropcap]996, I’m up at 2 am on a Friday dubbing College radio — as was the routine at the time — and then I hear it, “You’ll See” by The LOX featuring the Notorious B.I.G. Over the repurposed instrumental of Faith Evan’s “Used To Love Me,” the trio (though obviously younger) had that signature chemistry that we’ve always collectively loved them for, and of course a flame emoji Biggie verse. The song was dubbed off that original tape so many times the tape popped.\n\n<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-21574\" src=\"http://aboveaveragehiphop.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/ACEDB9D8-27BB-46AC-8C3C-8F1CB860566F.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"900\" height=\"600\" />\n\nThe following year, we became even better versed with the Yonkers trio, as they made incredibly high profile appearances; first on Puffy’s “All About The Benjamins,” Ma$e’s “24 Hours To Live” and then on Mariah Carey’s “Honey” remix. By the time “If You Think I’m Jiggy” dropped on white label samplers, the hype for their debut album <i>Money Power Respect </i>was tremendous.\n\n20 years later, it remains one of those albums that has stuck with me; though dipped in elements from the grandiose height of Jiggy” era, which was stamped with big budget videos and shiny suits, the album holds up with its incredible production and (timeless) street-hop lyricism.\n\nWhen I call an album timeless, I base that title on the ability to rock an album all these years later and still have the same impact as it did the first time I rocked it. To put that statement into perspective, playing the debut album by Das Efx today likely doesn’t create the same charm as it did back in the day.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/SPgyE0DP2BA\n\nThe title track of this album can still be played anywhere — at any time — and garner a positive reaction. The shit is a classic. But, apparent hits aside, it’s B-sides like the Carl Thomas “Let’s Start Rap Over,” which is an homage to rap legends of the 80s, or the spacey “All For The Love” instrumental that genuinely carry this project.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/51pCsYMJyW8\n\nEnding with the touching “We’ll Always Love Big Poppa,” a tribute to Biggie, the album ultimately stands up as the end of the golden era of Bad Bay Entertainment. With Ma$e’s eventual departure from the game, Biggie returning to the essence, and Puff’s solo career taking on a new life of its own — on top of The Lox’s campaign to be released from the label — shit was never really the same. The label had hits and had a more than a few new “superstars” on its ever-changing roster, but nothing felt as powerful and impactful as their original run.\n\n<i>Money Power Respect</i> is a classic album. Plain and simple. Whether you’re a Young head wondering how The Lox came to be so revered, or an old head who hasn’t bumped this album since your teens, It’s worth revisiting — in fact, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLBFAF8BFB040F5550\">here it is</a>. Press play and let it run.",

    "content_html": "[dropcap]T[/dropcap]rack Seven Band is a Group that I’ve covered numerous times here on AAHH as their debut project’s lifeline has been given a few extensions with visual treatments and live performances. This past week, they dropped their final video from the project, the title track — “The Try An The Fail.”\n\n<strong>Related: <a href=\"http://aboveaveragehiphop.com/indiespotlight-track-seven-band-the-try-and-the-fail/\">#IndieSpotlight: Track Seven Band – <em>The Try And The Fail</em></a></strong>\n\nThe EP is — in case you missed my editorial — a slice of resilience, a call to action, and a cathartic chunk of musical therapy for the band’s lead singer, Cost, who among other things, confronted the loss of his mother to cancer on the seven-song project.\n<blockquote>Don’t give up it will be alright, as long as you have life you gon’ put up that fight. —Cost</blockquote>\n“The Try And The Fail” was the project’s anthem of hope in the face of seemingly insurmountable adversity. The video treatment attempts to illustrate that from many angles; there’s a range of examples presented in the 3-minute clip, from the stand against injustice in Ferguson to the iconic image of the late Muhammad Ali standing above the vanquished Sonny Liston — an iconic image of victory/perseverance that has endured for decades.\n\nThe video, more than anything, takes the lyrics, which (in the verses) focus mainly on Cost’s drive to overcome his obstacles, and globalize them into a call for unification. Whether it be against greater systems of oppression, or rampant social issues that affect not only our well-being but collective (and generational) future, it’s a plead to keep it moving regardless of what happens.\n\nGiven the climate of today’s world, which feels as though it’s one false move away from imploding, the song seems like a necessary injection of positive energy.\n\nIt’s a powerful message, and — as the EP’s final single — a fitting end to the project’s promotional run. There hasn’t been a date set in stone for the release of the impending LP, but if you haven’t been up on Track Seven Band, definitely do yourself a favor and check out their project, <a href=\"http://aboveaveragehiphop.com/indiespotlight-track-seven-band-the-try-and-the-fail/\">here</a>.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/3x7ZCqz9rNo",

I reviewed his album <a href=\"http://aboveaveragehiphop.com/l-s-d-off-the-grid/\"><em>Off The Grid</em></a>, which was — in hindsight — an extremely well-crafted body of work. What I like about this kid is his genuine spirit. “I’m not in it for fame or making money,” he tells AAHH. “I do it for the creative process itself these days.”\n\nWhile he’s stayed true to his “off the grid” persona, he’s recently poked his head out to drop some new music. His latest single, “That’s Life” embodies the concept of living your best life and refusing to get hung up on the shit that doesn’t matter.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/J9Ro98lrdZw\n \n\n<blockquote>I'm blessed with the foresight as I live more life/Like: no more going out and an getting paralytic/And finding my Friday night ending with the paramedics/Instead, it's getting fresh with friends in a backyard session /Laughing at the silly sh** we did as adolescents</blockquote>\nWith a soulful sample and some cuts to round out the tight production, it encapsulates everything I love about carefree Hip Hop with no fluffy, over-commercialized bullshit.",

    "excerpt": null,
    "content_html": "[dropcap]B[/dropcap]ack in 2001, Vast Aire and Vordul Mega — collectively known as Cannibal Ox — released their debut album, <i>The</i> <em>Cold Vein</em>, which was (also) the first release from the legendary underground label Definitive Jux. Over production by label founder (and Company Flow off-shoot) El-P, the duo had incredible chemistry that propelled the album into Hip Hop reverence. In fact, it still finds itself on many lists of best post-millennium albums.\n\nhttps://m.youtube.com/watch?v=4qPw7_z4sCs\n \n\nHowever, it wouldn’t be until 2015 — 14 years removed — that they returned with a fresh (yet familiar) sound, courtesy of new lead producer Bill Cosmiq. This was due to a rift between Vast and El-P, a rumored (and later debunked) break-up due to Mega’s alleged clinical depression, solo endeavors, and other factors, that kept them working on everything but a sophomore release.\n\nAs Vast explains to AAHH, Bill Cosmiq, now just going by COSMIQ, was close with one of his childhood friends. When they connected later in life, their creative connection was undeniable. The rest is, well, history.\n\nIt’s been three years since the release of <i>Blade Of Ronin</i> and Vast and COSMIQ are on the verge of releasing a new collaborative effort entitled <i>AIREPLANE</i>. As fans of the incredibly potent wordsmith have come to expect, it promises to be conceptual, cinematic, and a whole lot of other adjectives that all point to amazing.\n\n“It has multiple layers to it,” Vast explains to AAHH. “The whole theme of this album is layers, levels, dimensions, plateaus, corridors, rooms, closets, drawers ... this is the micro to the macro; this is going from a cell to a giant nebulous star.”\n\n“We're gonna start at the base chamber of the pyramid, and at the end of the album we're gonna end up at the gold cap, and you're gonna hear this sonically,” he says. “This is not just something we're claiming. We're designing the album to have a beginning, a middle, and an end. It's going to draw you towards an apex ... a zenith, if you will.”\n\n“I think the analogy of the airplane was the perfect way for us to describe that journey that we're trying to take people through,” COSMIQ adds. “Every track is like we're taking you to a different place; we want the listener to sit back and listen to the whole process in its entirety. It's not just a series of singles.”\n\nAs Vast explains, the project does have singles, but they serve as mini-movie trailers. “In a trailer, you've got the middle, you've got the end, you've got the beginning. You don't know what you're looking at in a trailer. So by us showing you “Dark Metropolis,” which we released a few weeks back, and also our current world premiere of “Airebender,” it's just a peek. It's a nice, beautiful peek.”\n\nhttps://m.youtube.com/watch?v=Lt0VX1HGjOo\n<blockquote>This is some of the greatest music that I've ever made, and the reoccurring theme is the struggle for perfection.\n—Vast Aire</blockquote>\n“Digest the metaphor,” Vast continues. “Some people, their ears bother them on the airplane at different altitudes. Some people can't hold they lunch. In the end, though, you're gonna love your journey, you're gonna love your destination, and when you land, everyone's gonna be clapping.”\n\n16 years after <i>The Cold Vein</i>, Vast notes that he stills feels pressure when putting together a project. “If we don't have the pressure, then something's wrong. We don't love it anymore,” he explains. “We need the pressure. That's how you know we care about what we do.”\n\nBefore <i>AIREPLANE</i> drops, Vast has an EP planned entitled <i>AIREPORT. </i>“The EP is on a similar wavelength, but it's not all COSMIQ,” he says. “COSMIQ will be on it, and he'll be helping to guide it, but it's not gonna be all him. I'm gonna have guest producers, and there's gonna be more interaction with different MCs.”\n\n“I would look at it as <i>AIREPORT</i> is just a series of dope new records from IGC, and all the people connected to IGC,” COSMIQ adds. “Just giving fans a window into what we’ve been working on.”\n\nHaving entered the game back in the late 90s, Vast — and COSMIQ — are optimistic about how far we’ve come, unlike some of their contemporaries. “I think we're in a great time,” says Vast. “I think hip-hop is beautiful, I think hip-hop is great, and I think hip-hop is finally figuring out how infinite it is.”\n\n“We're figuring it out right now, that you can't limit us. We finally have fifty-year-old MCs. It took a while to get there,” he continues. “We have MCs that are about to knock on the door of 60. We have DJs that are 60. So pay attention. If Mick Jagger can run around the stage half naked at 70, we gotta allow KRS-One to do that.”\n\n“You can find whatever it is that you enjoy,“ COSMIQ says. “Some people have been catapulted to the top of the game with the style that, back in the day, I don't think the masses would've been ready for. Technology democratized the way we listen to music, and it isn't just one DJ that's telling you what you can listen to or only four [radio] stations.”\n\nThe million dollar question is, will there be another Cannibal Ox album? “Of course,” says Vast Aire. “We’re wrapped up in this project, but that’s definitively on the horizon.”\n\n<i>AIREPORT</i> and <i>AIREPLANE</i> are both dropping soon.\n\nhttps://m.youtube.com/watch?v=Pw-FD5e2ql4\n<blockquote>We had Stevie Wonder, and we had Whitney Houston, Prince, Marvin Gaye, the list goes on. We had these people, so we're trying to leave something for the next generation. — Vast Aire</blockquote>",

As he said during a recent interview with Defend New Orleans, his most significant motivation for pursuing his music was the loss of his father, whom he says supported his music 100%. “I almost feel like I have to do it,” he says. “It's almost like a fire in my heart now ... if I'm not chasing this, I'm probably wasting my time.”\n\nHe’s been on the grind for almost a decade, and building a steady buzz along the way; his fan base is loyal as hell,and this year he has a treat in store for them.\n\nHis latest project, <i>The Seville Show</i> is comprised of 3 EPs with a release strategy will mimic a multi-season TV show; listeners get a new song every other week until the 'season finale.' The first season, <i>The</i>, began early January with the premiere, \"The Love.\"\n\n“Currently, I'm working on the third EP in this series,” he says, “and after that, I am going to finish working on the debut album which should be sometime early 2019.”\n\nJames is one to keep an eye on, and the depth of this new project is poised to take his career to the next level he’s been chasing for the past seven years.\n\nCheck out “The Love,” below.\n\nhttps://open.spotify.com/album/5LxpBkfLK5lYEn3RS0Nbpf",

    "content_html": "[dropcap]I[/dropcap]t was back in early 2017 when rhymer El Gant, West-Coast vet Ras Kass, and Brown Bag All-Stars alumni J57 announced they were forming a super-group. In a video that featured the iconic DJ Premier dropping a heavy co-sign, Jamo Gang announced an upcoming project; a few singles and live footage followed.\n\nThat was over a year ago, and most fans had started to come to terms with the possibility that this collaborative project, like that of Liknuts, may never see the light of day.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uvczd5XUYZw\n \nThen, just last month, the trio resurfaced with new singles “All Eyes On Us” and “The Alter.” On January 30, their official EP finally hit the net.\n\n“We were ready to release a full album back when we announced the group,” J57 tells AAHH. “We then developed a new plan to create a ton of [new] songs and release an EP followed by the LP in 2018.”\n\n“The EP consists of songs that were intended for the first album, except for ‘Welcome to the Golden Era,’” he continues. “That was one of the new ones that were going to be on the LP, but it made so much sense to be on the EP ... so that's where it lives now.”\n\nhttps://m.youtube.com/watch?feature=youtu.be&v=wsAO2dSRwdE#\n \nThe trio initially met up while working on some songs in J57's Brooklyn studio back in late 2015.  “We decided to form a group once we realized how incredible the songs were turning out,” El Gant recalls. “Also, ‪DJ Premier‬ said that we should make this group a priority; we agreed.”\n\nWith the EP finally out in the world, they are turning their sights on a tour and finishing the impending LP. “The LP is 98% finished,” J57 reveals. “We might add one more track, but we have a lot of songs right now for it. We'll probably just end up selecting which ones will make the LP and whittle it down to a strong 12, maybe 14.”\n<blockquote>“We are going to be doing a full US tour, Canadian tour, European tour and an Australian tour, all in 2018.”</blockquote>\nThe most immediately captivating aspect of the group is their undeniable chemistry, which shines through both on and off the record. “It's interesting because on the one hand I'm working with someone who has become a very good friend over the years, so it's very natural,” El Gant says of Ras Kass, “but on the other hand sometimes I look over and think to myself \"That's F&%king Ras Kass! I have always been a HUGE fan of his work, so it's an honor not only to be working with him but the fact he takes my artistry and input very seriously.”\n\nAside from mutual respect Gant, Ras Kass is a big fan J57’s production. “I'm a big fan of things being sonic, and J57 embodies that,” he says.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/rLqtFcuKOSA\n \nAs Ras Kass explains, J’s beats do half the work. “It's his drums that first struck my attention, but then it was these gigantic soundscapes he presented which are very inspirational to me [as an artist]. Very often the mood alone of J's beats tell the story that we as the MCs then accentuate.”\n\nThe question on my mind — after hearing a top-secret song from the EP’s upcoming vinyl release (via J57 himself) — is when is the LP dropping. “The LP is going to be released in fall 2018 for sure,” J57 says.\n\nIf you haven’t bumped the EP, do so immediately.\n\n<center>\n<iframe style=\"border: 0; width: 350px; height: 720px;\" src=\"https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=4159476737/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/transparent=true/\" width=\"300\" height=\"150\" seamless=\"\"><a href=\"http://jamogang.bandcamp.com/album/jamo-gang-ep\">Jamo Gang EP by Jamo Gang</a></iframe></center>",

    "content_html": "[dropcap]C[/dropcap]arolina-born and Atlanta-finessed J Nyce, known to his closest friends and family as Jake is quick to denote that he isn’t just another rapper. “I'm anything my artistic ability allows for me to be,”\nHe clarified to AAHH. “I do love to sing more than rap I think.”\n\nA newcomer (seriously—his debut was last week), his music comes from his life experiences. “Pain, happiness, anger, shame, love, and hate are all emotions that I harness and let flow through my pen,” he says. “I write my music for a reason ... with a direction in mind.”\n\n\"I want you to feel something,” he continues. “I know that if I shed tears writing my new single, 'CICI' others would feel that same love. So I'm a true artist. I'm a real artist. And I'm changing the world.”\n\nThough this is his debut, he’s been making music for years. “I started rapping when Nas came out with \"Ether,” he says. He got his chops in high school cyphers battling for respect. “I guess that's why I'm so big on lyrical content and being able to perform,” he notes.\n\n“My Mom and Dad used to always sing,” he says discussing his earlier influences. “I remember times of seeing my Mom sing at wedding receptions and different gatherings, not knowing that those were occasions that subconsciously affected my drive to want to be on the mic and in front of a crowd till now.“\n\nhttps://soundcloud.com/theofficialjnyce/cici\n<blockquote>“I came here for a reason. I've always had dreams of being an awesome entertainer. So here I am.”</blockquote>\n\n“I'm currently working on my debut EP,”\nHe says proudly. “I'm working on becoming a household name like all of the greats. And I'm well on my way!”\n\nTo date, he’s opened shows for the likes of Project Pat. “I've been all over the country touring, destroying mics, and making lifelong friends and fans,” he says. “Recently partnering up with one of the greatest engineers I've ever had the pleasure of working with, Andre Moss(Up Some More Studios), I was able to produce one of the best songs I've ever heard, “CiCi.”\n\nHis goals in the game? “Mainstream. Mainstream. Mainstream.”\n\n“More tours, full radio rotation, a collab with Lil Wayne, and alot of business building,” he says. Stay tuned.",

    "content_html": "[dropcap]A[/dropcap] recent Tweet gave me—more so than an age check—some insight into how far back some of the younger listener’s insights into Hip Hop goes. While discussing the 19th anniversary of Eminem’s <em>Slim Shady LP</em>, one user tweeted that it was the album that he was forced to hide from his mother.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/specialdesigns/status/967533107376197632\n\nThat instantly reminded me of the album that was the one that I—and others in my bracket—had to hide from our parent, <i>Bacdafucup</i>, the debut effort from South Suicide Queens foursome (now a duo) Onyx.\n\nI was excited for this kid to learn about—and experience—this project for the first time, but more so stopped to reflect on why that album is such a notable standout in my timeline.\n\n1993 was a vastly different time in Hip Hop. It wouldn’t be until later that year when heads would experience Wu-Tang Clan’s game-changing debut, and we’d yet to experience 2Pac and Biggie at their height.\n\nWhile New York had set the tone in the 80s, many of its most prominent stars had begun to slightly dim beneath the height of ‘Gangsta Rap,’ as led by NWA. The departures of Ice Cube and (eventually) Dre from the group, the rise of Death Row, and the massive commercial success of this new sub-genre gave steam to a new breed of artists that wanted to bite onto the wave. Even some older respected names like RUN DMC (for example) tried to hop on the fad.\n\nThere was an alternative genre brewing, with acts such as De La Soul, Tribe Called Quest—and other members that eventually rounded out the Native Tongues—presenting what began as an almost “hippie” movement. They worked to counteract the over-glorified violent undertones that seemed to be not only dominating the airwaves, causing waves of controversy, but painting the black experience in a more negative spotlight than it may have needed.\n\nThis was the era. Discovered by RUN DMC’s DJ Jam Master Jay, Onyx—comprised of Sticky Fingaz, Fredro Starr, Suavé, and the late Big DS—became the hardcore answer to anything the West had to offer; while Dre may have amalgamated other’s experience to create what he called “entertainment,” Onyx was different on many levels.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/A4Topy8lweQ\n \nThey felt very, for lack of a better term, authentic. Very New York, very street, and very gritty. Their rough around the edges exterior never seemed to let it’s guard down, which ultimately bolstered their image even more. It was violent, without over-selling it to the point of macabre detachment from reality, like some horror-core acts from that era. It sounded as thought Sticky was a flop away from being the very figure he rapped about.\n\nThe Def Jam release of <i>Bacdafucup</i> was filled with no-holds-barred angst, incredible production, and a considerable amount of clear character development. The chemistry was crazy, but Fredro was the firecracker, Suavé was the lyrical third wheel, and Sticky was the shooter.\n\nSticky Fingaz never seems to make any lists, but day ones can agree that his verse on “Throw Your Gunz” made them instant fans.\n\n<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-22125\" src=\"http://aboveaveragehiphop.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/9DB521CF-AAD0-4862-A4E4-3FC71EF332C0.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"900\" height=\"600\" />\n\nThey had a level of believable grit that translated into sales; ultimately they had some arguably classic releases, and Sticky and Fredro branched out into acting. “Slam” is still one of the biggest tracks of the era, and the album rests on more than one top albums ever list—which counts for something.\n\nThey are still active, and recently released a brand new project called <em>Black Rock</em>. However, without the proper context, it’s impossible for anyone who was first introduced to shock-rap by Eminem to understand their impact fully. Discovering this LP for yourself is highly recommended.\n\nYou’re welcome.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/mQmfzGf9904\n \nhttps://youtu.be/7ADgCeYJMN4\n \nhttps://youtu.be/6yIgxwldTB8\n \nhttps://youtu.be/F3FfINzC-KY",

    "content_html": "[dropcap]Q[/dropcap]ueens, New York, may be the home base of rapper Seven 30, but the 23-year-old is repping for everywhere on the map that’s ever showed him love—from Canada, New Orleans, and Texas to the Dominican Republic and Florida. Everything about the young rapper is different, down to his influences that include 50 Cent, Young Thug, Canibus, Frank Sinatra, and Bach, a strange brew that makes up his artistic mantra.\n\n“My mother put me onto the greatest music since birth,” he tells AAHH, noting that she was his biggest influence. “Even with the odds against us, she made it work—by herself. Throughout her battle with cancer, car accident, becoming an amputee, she instilled in me that ‘the sky’s the limit.’”\n\nIt’s this strength that’s ultimately guided the young dreamer toward pursuing music, an outlet that slowly became a necessity.\n\n“I needed an outlet ... I was always trapped,” he explains. “Trapped in life, emotions, fear, and the streets. I wanted out, and the music was [a way out]. As things got worse in life, it wasn’t enough to just listen; I wanted to be heard.”\n\nWhat makes him genuinely endearing as an artist is a soft-spoken backstory that many listeners aren’t privy to; Seven 30 suffers from Multiple Personality Disorder (MPD), something that both his mother and sister also suffer from. “The voices in my head go 1000 miles per hour,” he says.\n\nAs he describes, though, the voices seem to work together when it comes to his music. “They all rapidly hit every instrument so precise and differently,” he explains. “Sometimes it’s all different octaves and different notes ... it’s all quite insane, but in a good way.”\n\n“This disorder, or this ‘blessing,’ is why I’m still here making music.”\n\nHis voices, according to him, seem to get along. This control is rare, and he notes that he’s seen others—including his family—have a much different experience. “That’s what I do it for, to let them know ‘you’re not crazy and you’re not alone. We can overcome this,” he says.\n\nHis music is confidently dipped into the waters of the contemporary wave but playfully experiments with alternative rock influences to create a sound as unique as he is. Seven 30 is worth sitting with and adding to your playlists.\n\n“This isn’t just a fame thing or a way to get rich,” he says confidently, “this is me.” Press play.\n\nhttps://soundcloud.com/seven30bih/same-730\n\nhttps://soundcloud.com/seven30bih/kodeine-kisses-730\n\nhttps://soundcloud.com/seven30bih/me-myself-my-trigger-730",

It’s masterpiece centered around equal parts social injustice and commentary, and — more endearing — fatherhood, and the role it played in his life.\n<h4><a href=\"http://exclaim.ca/amparticle/skyzoo-in_celebration_of_us\">RELATED: <span style=\"color: #ff0000;\">Read my review of the album.</span></a></h4>\nOne of the more compelling tracks, the outro “Honour Amongst Thieves,” features a lengthy live recording of Skyzoo telling the story of how his Father played a quintessential role in his early life; a story made all the more touching considering he is now a father.\n\nAs Skyzoo explains, the story itself just came to him. “It [was told on] a public access network in Brooklyn called BRIC TV. I did a show with some people there,” he said. “They had this segment where it was storytellers ... they had people come in to tell a story, any story that they wanted to a crowd. I was invited by a woman named Angela to be on that show. It was me, and a bunch of other people and everyone told their story over the course of like five or 10 minutes.”\n\nAs Skyzoo explains, he showed up unprepared. “I had a lot going on, but I promised I would do it. She's a great person. So, I said, ‘Okay, let me do this,’ he says.\n\n“I kind of didn't think of a story ahead of time. I was ripping and running a lot. So, when I got there and the clock was ticking. It was like, ‘All right, this guy's up next.’ I'm thinking: ‘what the hell am I going to talk about?’ And, then, it just came.\n\n“It came to me on the spot. Once I did it, after the applause you hear and everything at the end, [I knew] it came out dope,” he said. “I asked the people at the network for the audio ... I knew this would be fly to put on the album.”\n\nCheck out the full story, below.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/h6HoBh42I_E?t=3m48s",

    "content_html": "[dropcap]T[/dropcap]he best part about being a writer is discovering dope new music; this week I was put on to an artist who—though far from new—was new to my radar. Chicago-born Real Talk The Metaphor Messiah, currently living in Vegas, dropped a new project entitled <em>King Slayer Turned King</em>, and I’m here for it!\n\nAt seven songs in length, the record feels kind of like tuning into season six of an HBO series and hoping to catch on. Not that you get lost—as there isn’t any continuity-based conceptual songwriting happening. Instead, he is exceptionally polished, lending to the fact that this isn’t his first project, and much of the non-rapping dialogue focuses on his legacy.\n\nI did some digging around before giving the LP a third spin; he has a lot of great material in his catalog; what stands out is his diversity, traversing empowering content, social commentary, and good old fashioned bars. It doesn’t necessarily subscribe to a particular lane, so I’m having a difficult time making specific comparisons, but check out these records for a great idea of what he’s on.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/_gq59E8Ql9A\n\nhttps://youtu.be/_DLgi6A_o_Q\n \n<blockquote>“A lot of artists come out and only talk about one thing ... and that one thing isn’t something they live.”\n—Real Talk</blockquote>\nNow, a few facts that will add context to his new project. First is his relationship with producer Geesus. “[We’ve been working together for] about ten years ... he's been doing my beats for a long time, and he's my best friend,” he tells AAHH. This is vital, as he produces most of the LP, and he also has an interlude.\n\nThe second fact, back in 2016 he lost his eyesight for about seven months—something he overcame after having surgery to reattach his retinas. It’s something that comes up quite a bit on the project and isn’t just a metaphor...it’s a literal reference to an experience that profoundly changed his outlook.\n\n“God MC’s don’t die,” he states on the outro of the opening track, “Hip Hop Is Mine.” The record has a serious bop—and Real Talk is in his pocket off the rip. His bars and delivery are on point. “Niggas all fake fucking You-Tube rappers,” he raps. \n\n“War Games” is another standout. With a super interesting instrumental—the sample almost has a regal feel to it.\n\n“Baal” is a dope track; Real Talk has a 90s Hip Hop influence—and this instrumental and flow highlight that. This one was (according to what I’ve been able to ascertain) was the first track he laid down following his Euro tour.\n\nHe gave this one a visual treatment, check that out below.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/HCHypY7MCN0\n \nLook, at seven tracks (a few of which are interludes) it’s a light listen that begs for a few complete run throughs. His catalog of visuals are impressive; not only is quality there, but the plays are crazy. Also—again—he’s touring and making noise. As the project ends with the piano-driven title track, he solidifies himself as a voice that will lead us to the “truth.” Whether or not you honestly believe that, he’ll point you in a different, more positive direction than plenty of records forced into your personal space.\n\nGive it a spin.\n\nhttps://open.spotify.com/album/29LHOuVqfas388JnZ36K3V?fo=1",

    "content_html": "[dropcap]B[/dropcap]ack as a youngster, my neighbour had gotten a job working as a promotional rep for an College radio station; during his tenure, he often let me hang posters and things of that nature, paying me in promo tapes and records. This was during the Def Jux era. I fondly remember that as a coming of age period for me, and anything that remotely reminds me of it gets an auto-pass.\n\nEvery once in awhile I come across artists who evoke those memories, without trying too hard — which is corny. Luckily I found a great one who’s been on repeat all weekend, The Lord Razu. Drawing inspiration from 90s Hip Hop, video games, Kung-Fu flicks, anime (and things of that nature) he sounds like a descended of acts like GP-Wu, Kill Army. With a penchant for blending drum and bass elements, this self-produced rapper looks like a chip off of a young El-P’s block.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/VYx5GGPU_uU\n \nHis new project, Release, is full of bangers. Kicking off with the booming “Lyrical Frankenstein,” the project has a timeless sound. Immediate highlights were the head nodding “Lurkin’” with its dancehall chorus, and the piano-driven “Backstory.”\n\nHe has a relaxed cadence, and range of pen game that traverses a few lanes. There are some dope storytelling elements on the Latin-tinged love track “Cupid’s Kunai,” all the way to looser conceptual bar-for-bar gems like the spacey “Outta Time.” The flow on “Family” is crazy; he comes across like a long-lost Wu affiliate.\n\nDrenched in nostalgia with contemporary touches, and a healthy heap of samurai/ninja-ism, Razu is a gem—more than worth a spin. Highly recommend. Also, check out the visual treatment for “Lurkin’,” above.\n\nEarly.\n\nhttps://open.spotify.com/album/73BUv0iZGeac8VCyJcWsg1?si=ZyCJua6lRu-c_hNMsaHBVA",

    "content_html": "[dropcap]K[/dropcap]aiju The Unconquerable is an alumnus of my #indiespotlight series from last year when he released \"Episode 6\"—a dope mini-movie that anyone into Anime/comics/ninja type shit should revisit. He just sent \"Episode 7: Ultraman\" my way, and it’s fantastic.\n<h6><a href=\"http://aboveaveragehiphop.com/indiespotliught-kaiju-the-unconquerable-release-new-short-film/\">Related: <span style=\"color: #ff0000;\">#IndieSpotlight: Kaiju The Unconquerable Releases New Short Film</span></a></h6>\nThis time around, the story centers on Zenith, a 27-year-old Ultraman stationed in the US. He became an Ultraman after his father attempted to tamper with the gene and ultimately ended up dying in an attempt to distill and use its power. Fast forward; Zenith is the only one with this power (on this side of the world), and—in the course of the six-minute mini film fights a deadly alien, lighting up the NYC skyline in the process.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5PXgX6U3Ao\n \nIt’s, literally as rad as it sounds. From his Ultraman arms and mask—which are insanely cool—to his Ultraman letterman jacket, which I would kill for, the visual is engaging, not unlike his past material. He also directed it, which needs to be acknowledged.\n\nMuch like his previous work, which I discussed before, Kaiju’s image and music play off of each other but don’t depend on each other, at all. DOOM is DOOM, that’s his character. This song, for example, is a really dope song as a stand-alone; if you were to listen to just the song, you might take Ultraman as a metaphor--among many others in the lyrically dense track--and rock with it.\n\nThe video is what makes it literal. \"Ultraman\" is a really (really) good song, I can’t stress that enough. Kaiju may come across as niche if you peruse through his catalog, but he’s extremely accessible.\n\nRecommend content—really sit with this one. Early!",

His first solo mixtape <em>Plan For Tomorrow</em> (from 2009) was hosted by the illustrious DJ Lazy K and featured verses from some of the game's most respected: French Montana, Max B, Styles P of the mighty D-Block, and the late Fatal Hussein of the Outlawz. He's since released numerous projects, beats tapes, and -- shit -- even a videogame last year entitled Ohio Hustler.\n\nBut, Scotty is intent on leaving a legacy.\n\nThe largely self-produced artist has a new album in the works, entitled Future History; mysteriously (and cryptically), he refers to is as the \"Scottie Jax album you will never hear.\" He notes in his release details that it's set to release in the year 2100. \"I feel that it's not about the person who leaves the legacy, but the legacy itself,\" he writes. \"I will no longer be living, so the least I can try to do is make the world a better place than it was when I was living on it.\" There is no word on the platform he will choose for this LP -- as there's no telling if they will still be around. We can only hope he drops the LP long before that.\n\nIn the meantime (the very long meantime) you can check out a large portion of his catalog via Soundcloud.\n\nhttps://soundcloud.com/scottiejax",

    "content_html": "[dropcap]G[/dropcap]oing blind into an album is a liberating experience; with preconceived notions, it's easier to take a raw listen at the actual material -- without politics and BS. I had such an experience just this week with an artist name Donny DoomsDay. Everything about this guy is intriguing post-three listens. His latest LP, the hefty 17-song slice of hip-hop that is<em> Reality Raps</em> is loaded with positivism, a good amount of relatability, BARS, and unabashed nods to his Christianity.\n\nTo top it all off, he delivers a healthy tribute to the screwed up sound Texas is synonymous with.\n\nWhat was most intriguing about the album was the layers I uncovered during my three top to bottom spins. Upon the first pass, I was taken in by the production. The project begins with \"Moonlight,\" which has an eerie/jazzy sound; \"who's the dealer and who's the fiend,\" he asks rhetorically. Elsewhere, I found myself running back \"Fifth Wheel Motion,\" his (sonic) salute to the style Texas became famous for, where you can almost imagine his dense wordplay getting a \"chopped not slopped\" treatment.\n\n\"Texas Made,\" which walks you through life in the section was another one that got a few run backs, with it's slick, atmospheric record pops.\n\nUpon the second pass, I got deeper into his wordplay. He's a Christian rapper, as I've come to know upon more research, but he doesn't at all shove it down your throat; instead, he makes positive music. Not rainbows and shit, just ... positive. Let me break that down.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W9Ns7QZPaBk\n \n\"Graveyardz\" follows him as he comes home from a literal graveyard shift at a plant, only to look at the face of his sleeping with and realizing his grinding is all worth it. \"Selfish\" is another example, where he raps about how he -- despite circumstances -- manages to stay out of jail, chases degrees rather than selling drug; he even raps about paying taxes on the second verse.\n\nKeep in mind, the production on this LP is amazing, so he has these trap tinged, dark, southern tracks made for rolling around to in a candy painted Cadillac at midnight, but it is at points, (lyrically) swimming against the grain like a hip-hop salmon.\n\nThen there are these really powerful records in the mix, like \"Nothing To Something,\" where he addresses the sameness of emcees in the game: \"concepts are the same ... the producers are the real artists, I'm a say it.\" Another clear standout for me was \"Villainy,\" where he discusses the illusionary nature of the \"things\" that hip-hop culture consider important. This particular song is two-fold, also looking at the way he perceives himself as being viewed, despite being anything but a basic \"rap guy.\"\n<blockquote>\"You can run the trap; I'll run to the bank with a business plan.\"\n--Donny DoomsDay</blockquote>\n\"Many Blessings\" was probably the song with the most overt show of his faith, though he does instill it into bars throughout the album, and you can't overlook \"Been Praying,\" either.. Tracks like \"Coach Store\" and \"Give It and Go\" do throw you off the trail though, without really listening to the bars, a light listen of this LP lets a lot of amazingness go over your head.\n\nThere is a ton to love and unpack on Reality Raps, but it's worth getting lost in for a day -- or two.\n\nhttps://open.spotify.com/album/4SpuLCchWl575fad158iUQ?si=WFRxzXPuQye7Bv9Hcj3xkg",

    "content_html": "[dropcap]A[/dropcap]fter building a pretty notable buzz with his first four mixtape releases, emcee Royce Ripken, formerly Stretch Dinero—aka Supastaxx—has finally released an official full-length debut, <em>Home Run Ripken</em>.\n\nThe 13-song affair is seemingly scattered regarding contextual content, but it is—after a few top to bottom listens—actually entirely cohesive, and packed with a balance of motivation, hype, and tunes for your girlfriend (see “Double Up”). Though the production credits aren’t front street, this man needs to buy his team a few beers, it sounds great.\n\nNow, let’s break down the highs and lows; we’ll start with the standouts. “Flame Out” and “Run It Back” are his best attempts at generating an anthemic vibe on this LP. “Grand Slam” also deserves honorable mention. Lyrically on all three, he packs in as many smart punchlines as possible and then unleashes super catchy choruses. Sounds simple, but it isn’t. Earworms are an art.\n\n<iframe style=\"border: 0; width: 100%; height: 120px;\" src=\"https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=3038974232/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/tracklist=false/artwork=small/track=2957028941/transparent=true/\" seamless><a href=\"http://royceripken.bandcamp.com/album/home-run-ripken\">Home Run Ripken by Royce Ripken</a></iframe>\n\nZac Alan’s chorus on “Run It Back,” with its grungy distortion in the high-end has an alternative vibe that feels top 40 radio ready.\n\n<iframe style=\"border: 0; width: 100%; height: 120px;\" src=\"https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=3038974232/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/tracklist=false/artwork=small/track=980303555/transparent=true/\" seamless><a href=\"http://royceripken.bandcamp.com/album/home-run-ripken\">Home Run Ripken by Royce Ripken</a></iframe>\n\nIf tasked with naming a top 2 on this album it would hands down be “They Want The Real. Pt. 2”—the most intimate point on the LP—and “Jiggle,” with it’s sped up Ellie Goulding sample. Throughout the project, he alluded to street life at a few points, but “They Want The Real. Pt. 2” is the first time that he seems to let you in, discussing his time in the streets, being locked up, and his daily struggle to stay on the right path as he explores his career in music. It’s more retrospective than descriptive.\n\n“Jiggle” is way less profound, but garnered about 15 plays in a day on my phone. That beat is Fuego.\n\n<iframe style=\"border: 0; width: 100%; height: 120px;\" src=\"https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=3038974232/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/tracklist=false/artwork=small/track=191460819/transparent=true/\" seamless><a href=\"http://royceripken.bandcamp.com/album/home-run-ripken\">Home Run Ripken by Royce Ripken</a></iframe>\n\nThere are few actual low points on the project. He is an intelligent guy—lyrically—so “That Bag,” when compared to the (kind of) avant-garde thinking of “Catch These Fists,” seems pretty necessary.\n\nOverall, though, it’s a respectable debut from Royce Ripken, and sure to set him on the right path!",

He's also a veteran having served in Afghanistan. His globe-trotting has peppered his work with a unique worldwide flair. A humorous story is that he credits a trip to Thailand with the instilling in him the confidence to create music.\n\n\"A local shopkeeper asked me if I was a rap star,\" he says with a laugh. Not one to shy away, Tae played along and laid down a quick 16 bars to a receptive crowd. That's when he knew music was his calling.\n\nHis debut, <em>Smooth Way Out</em>, is an amalgamation of Tae's life thus far -- from the streets to the battlefields of Afghanistan. The LP's message is distinct: the smooth way out of a [particular] situation may not be the easiest one; but, it’s an effective one. \"There are two ways to get your voice heard, it’s about music and politics, and I’ve always stuck by that,\" said Smooth. \"Everything is art. Your expressions are your art, and mine happens to be my voice.\"\n\nCheck out the latest visual for “Payback,” the project’s first single, below.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/TsWEcAB8Arg",

    "content_html": "[dropcap]B[/dropcap]rothers Australia and Michael Hoover — who perform under the monickers Ubiquitous Poet (U.P.) and Eloquent — got into the game in 1990. To put that into perspective for some younger readers, that same year Brand Nubian dropped their debut All For One, and Ice Cube dropped his first post-NWA solo venture, Amerikkka’s Most Wanted. Hip Hop has, and it goes without saying, changed a lot in the past 28 years.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span>\n\nSo what are two emcees/creatives too old for the new wave and too in love with the culture to quit to do. Well, the duo — collectively known as the Kinship found a unique creative vision, and have spun that focus into a multi-media company spanning animations and comic book.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span>\n\n“We now write and produce a variety of works [beyond music],” says Australia. “Every bit of work we produce is written or curated in-house.”\n\nThe concept of an Out of Place Artifact, an idea realized by American naturalist and cryptozoologist Ivan T. Sanderson, is one that catalyzes the majority of the duo’s current film, music, comic books, and other projects they have under development — though that growth was organic. Inspiration first sparked a song, which became a series of songs, which expanded into a full-fledged movement and mantra.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span>\n\nThe series of songs, which have all been released for a few months now, serve as support for an upcoming film, which is set to drop this Summer. That seems like a lot on one plate, but Kinship never sleeps; they have some new music videos, notable the mini-movie “Love You Like That,” an exciting look at what the pair can create.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/z0SlKqJpq1w\n \nThe visual is — well — a little hard to watch. It follows a woman’s journey through an abusive relationship, which culminates into a surprise ending that you need to see for yourself. The scene where the mother sees her daughters bruised face is heart-wrenching. This is Music with a message and powerful cinematic imagery that helps bolster their company’s ability to produce quality.\n\n“In essence, Kinship Entertainment is now operating as a multi-media company,” Australia notes. “Still owned and operated by me and my brother Michael. Just like in 1990.”\n\nStay tuned.",

    "excerpt": null,
    "content_html": "[dropcap]I[/dropcap]f one were to ask “who is the most played artist in Jersey via SoundCloud,” there’s a good chance Maxi Maxx May not be the first name to pop in your head — even though he ranks second in the state only to Fetty Wap with 50 million plays. The Jersey rapper has been in the game for just over seven years, working with some incredible notable acts along the way, like the recently released Meek Mill. So why hasn’t the young upstart ascended to the next level? He’s on his way.\n\nhttps://instagram.com/p/Bg2SNnxlCmU/\n\nCurrently, he’s connected with Interscope — strictly as a host for distribution of his music — but Maxx is hopeful the relationship could blossom further as he preps his full 2018 LP. Today, though, he’s reveling in positive feedback from his latest mixtape, <i>Everybody Raps</i>, which features (aside from his crew) vocals from songstress Kehlani (“Cum Thru”).\n\n<iframe src=\"https://embed.tidal.com/player/?type=t&id=86307567\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"width:100%;height:180px;\"></iframe>\n\n“This tape was just to let everybody know who I am,” he tells AAHH. “The official album is [going to drop] when they get more comfortable ... this tape was just to let them know that I'm still here.”\n\nIt’s an understandable motivation; though he’s had some incredible looks, he’s had some disheartening false-starts and setbacks. His first significant opportunity came after a chance meeting with Meek Mill, who was impressed by songs off of Maxx’s Lazy K hosted debut.\n\nhttps://soundcloud.com/maxx_stead/maxi-maxx-feat-meek-mill-weak-people\n \nMeek was interested in remixing one of Maxx’s records, but due to clearance issues Maxx couldn’t facilitate it; that led to them working on the song “Weak People,” which to date has over 1.6 million plays. “He sent it back 48 hours, no charge,” he says. “[Meek] was like ‘this one is on me, the next one is on you.’ Ever since then, we kept in contact. We were in touch through the whole Nicki Minaj relationship; he kept calling me, putting me on game ... kept motivating me like that. Like a big brother.”\n\nThe deal was on the table, however — much to his chagrin — it was a writing deal for lesser-known MMG artists. As well, during that period, Maxx saw a situation his cousin Choo Biggz went through during a video shoot for the song “Tonight” featuring Tank, Fetty Wap, and 50 Cent. Though he was paid, Fif was a no-show. The experience left a bad taste in his mouth and jaded him on the prospect of signing to other artists.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/FoQo4vyyZJQ\n \n“That's what made me not want to sign to other artists because other artists don't want to see you grow,” he states.\n\nHe’s grown from the situation, and is more motivated than ever; with a catalog that includes the likes of Jeremih, Weeknd, and Yachty, he is ready to be more than just an artist you’ve heard here or there. Instead, he’s aiming for the spotlight — and a chance to share his whole truth on a larger scale.\n\n“I will be the best rapper then come out of Jersey,” he says with a laugh. “Shout out to Redman.”",

To top it off, he’s making a move to LA to embed himself in the west coast stoner culture.\n\nFresh on the heels of Coachella and the release of his \"Green Man\" visual, featuring legendary dancehall artist Louie Rankin — of Belly fame — he sat with AAHH for a quick Q&A. Check it out, below.   \n\nhttps://youtu.be/5fMm78_WF4w\n \n<strong>How did you get into the game?</strong>\n \nI started out freestyling with my friends in high school which led to me doing battle rap for a few years. I won some big battles in Toronto and then started putting out music independently.\n \n<strong>Who were some of your influences coming up?</strong>\n \nI use to listen to a lot of Big Pun, Tupac, and Eminem.  Rappers like Fabolous and Jadakiss also inspired my style a lot. Before rap, I listened to a bit of rock too.\n \n<strong>I hear you’re headed to LA; what are your plans out there?\n </strong>\nI can’t wait to get back to the lab and work with producers I met while working out there. I also plan on shooting a bunch of new videos and stopping by some radio stations. Check out my last interview and freestyle on dash radio.\n \n<strong>Let’s chat about your latest video; how did you connect with Louie Rankin?</strong>\n \nLouie is an OG, and he's always in Toronto. We got to link up one day, and I played him the song. He started spazzing so when I thought of the concept I knew he would be dope to kick it off.\n \n<strong>Is there a project in the works?</strong>\n \nMy mixtape is coming out this summer. It got a lot of different sounds and collabs on there. I'm super excited for my fans to hear what I have been cooking up in the past year.\n \n<strong>Tell me more about <em>The Dispensary</em>.</strong>\n \nThe tape features Zoey Dollaz, Lil Duke, Big Lean, 808 Mafia, Arrabmuzuk and more. I also have a clothing line called the Dispensary which im pushing alongside the tape. Look out for an official release date and release parties in a city near you.\n \n<strong>Canada is about to legalize weed: thoughts?</strong>\n \nI think it’s about goddamn time. The movement has been stable for ten plus years now, and I'm happy to see people not having to face charges and worry about going to jail for weed. Hopefully, the government here in Canada can figure out a good system to distribute it and still offer good quality at a reasonable price to the consumer.\n \n<strong>Any last words?</strong>\n \nFollow my social @MintyBurns and subscribe to my youtube channel @planetminty. My Official video for Green Man video is out now! Go check that out and burn one. Much Love!",

    "content_html": "[dropcap]I [/dropcap]love following up on artists that I get good vibes from. Take Baton Rouge, Louisiana rapper Lil 627, for example. He once told me “I’m an artist who tries to make different music, and create my [own] lane.” Finally dropping off a full-length since his last entries on our site, “Poor Nigga Blues” and \"Stairway,\" he more than lives up to his statement.\n\n<em>Music For Real People</em> is an eclectic ride that rides a vintage Hip Hop sound — riding sonic palettes that at times have jazzy back sound and at others draw from the regional sounds that put his region on the map. The first song on the LP, “Pipes,” packed with gorgeous saxophone, chunky baselines, and a subtle vinyl pop, he raps about pressures being a black man in his section—Senay’s vocals pull it all together.\n\n“Know Some” and “How You Feel” sound like they came right out of the MPC of Beats By The Pound (No Limit’s in-house production team) circa 1997. It's a sound that dominated his region during that period when the South established itself as \"a thing\" in Hip Hop and a sound that has found its way into 6's music.\n\nHis life/struggle bars on the soulful “Good Muzik” had me knocking the rewind button multiple times.\n\n“Vivid Picture” and “Shadows” stand out with a slightly different vibe to them—both lyrically and sonically. “Vivid Picture” for example has a subtle neo-soul tinge, while “Shadows” has super strong let’s that accentuate the smooth and paranoid flow that see 627 addressing the would-be assassins either praying or scheming on him to slip.\n\nOverall, <em>Music For Real People</em> is an excellent blend of nostalgic vibe, bars, and overall great vibes. Perfect for your summer drives. Officially drops on all platforms May 24 -- check back for the official stream.",

    "content_html": "[dropcap]H[/dropcap]ad a new LP float across my desk this week, ESP by Jahan Nostra — an emcee mounded by Stamford, Connecticut and Mount Vernon, New York. Now, the project isn’t new per say, as it initially dropped in 2016, and was remastered late last year. Regardless, I made it my movement music for a week.\n\nHere’s the breakdown.\n\nSonically, it’s difficult to put my finger on. The beats don’t quite hit the mark of what’s going on in-game today, not even quite from a backpacking 90s perspective. So it has this kind of literal timeless feeling to it. From the jazzy big-city New York vibe of “Welcome Home,” he sets a great vibe. It’s fully consistent, but it’s not a bad thing. He does maintain a keep it moving, maintain, and make it to the top theme for the first half of the LP songs like “Embrace The Rain.”\n\nhttps://youtu.be/XNDVUQzIgE4\n\nThe features on the LP are quite impressive. Philly mainstay Tone Trump hops on the super atmospheric “Whole Life,” and Brooklyn legends Smif N Wessun hop on the album highlight “No Stress.” The Rey Vega featured “One of Them Days” is way too understated, though. It’s probably one of my fave songs on the project, basically following him as he hits up ATL.\n\nThe second half of the LP has a few gems; “El Chapo” with Ceschi, “Time” featuring Kyro & Wednesday Atoms, and “Bricks and Sponsorship” all give more insight into Jahan as a street guy—without being at all explicit. The latter record, explores the cause and effect of street-life, with a running commentary on the prison system in the US.\n\nAt 16-songs in length, there is a lot to love. He’s a project boy who puts a lot into this music shit; everything about him suggests quality—right down to the photography. He has an excellent package. Looking forward to new material.\n\nEarly.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span>\n\nhttps://open.spotify.com/album/1WHxdUHcbRyi43JZuL4YAn?si=SfUuqMzGSDuLKSlIUL6sUg",

Set to be his biggest release to date since signing on with No Convo Entertainment — headed by acclaimed record producer Fye Jones — and to wet our appetites, has dropped off a new single and video, Dopeman.\n\nDirected by Brill Adium, the shadowy visual is a cinematic experience, with Pressure on the late night grind; the at times frantic camera motion plays up the almost paranoia-ridden state of being experienced by a trafficker in the trap amid a sea of potential downfalls. The big record is a brilliant look into the crystal ball of what to expect going forward.\n\n“I would describe my sound as reality music,” he tells AAHH, “very influential and soulful ... full of jewels.” As he describes it, his grandad and grandma influenced him the most; “seeing them work hard to provide for multiple people — and do it from the bare minimum — [pushes me to strive for the best].\n\nHe also tells us that signing with No Convo rests among his most significant achievements. “It’s an opportunity for me to do what I love and be supported by a company that believes in me,” he says.\n\nWith his eye on the prize, and the goal of creating a lasting legacy in the music industry, Pressure is one of the hungriest rappers we’ve come across in a minute. “We’re getting this project ready for the masses,” he confidently, pointing toward the near future.

After dropping <em>My Own</em> on Priority Records, the gritty southern MC signed with C-Bo's West Coast Mafia Records, cutting two more LPs.\n\nSeven years ago, he signed on with Strange Lane -- a sub-company under the Strange Music umbrella owned by Tech N9ne -- releasing a remix of \"How Ya Do Dat\" featuring Tech himself. That is just the tip of the iceberg for this incredibly active southern staple. Back on On March 26, he officially announced that he'd be releasing a new album entitled <em>Wut' Uh' Life</em>, expected to be released sometime this summer via his Trap Door Entertainment brand. The first taste of the LP, \"Shut Dis' B!tch Down,\" is currently making noise, and building heavy buzz.\n\nStream it, below.\n\nhttps://soundcloud.com/trapdoorent/young-bleed-shut-dis-b-tch",

    "content_html": "[dropcap]A[/dropcap]. Levy is a New Orleans artist who I’m kicking myself for just now getting up on; his latest LP Reparations is at once assertive, heavy, accessible, and just dripping with flame emoji juice. The 12-song effort — which dropped back in February — is unique in that it’s sound isn’t indicative of his region, nor does it ride any specific waves currently hitting the rocks of the game. It doesn’t even really subscribe to any old school or boom bap vibe.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span>\n\nOff the top, his wordplay is crazy. When researching him, I uncovered a collabo with Skyzoo, which is the way to my heart [pause], so the top to bottom listen was immensely satisfying. There are more than a few highlights; let’s start with the drum-less tracks that allow his vision to sparkle. The super-lyrical “Emancipation” with its soulful 2-minute chorus-less vibe and the ode to fatherhood “Black Boy,” which, as a fellow father, I felt.\n\n\n<h4><a href=\"https://alevyworld.bandcamp.com/album/reparations-2\">STREAM THE ALBUM HERE</a>.</h4>\n\n\n“Fuck Rap” was my fave joint; his ode to Hip Hop, which really illustrates his where he came up — “we really debated who was better, Turk or Lil Wayne” — and also uncovered a disappointing story from early in his career when No Limit Records artist Fiend gave him a wrong number after meeting at an event. It also seems to uncover that rap was never his first love with bars like “fuck rap, I wanted to be in the NFL,” and “fuck rap, I wanted to be Claude Monet. I guess the calling was too strong.\n\nHe also spends a considerable amount of the project speaking on racial issues — and identities — from different angles. Examples are “Django,” the title-track, and the “If I Was White,” which rhetorical ponders what he would do if he were Caucasian; there are some funny moments, like poking fun at the potential inferior basketball skills, while also showing more thought provoking commentary like not having to worry about police at night, or even have to acknowledge the hardships of African American.\n\nOverall, the LP is well produced, curated, and balanced. If you’re up on A. Levy already, you’ll love it. If not, you’re welcome.\n\nEarly.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5dUIT_MrkUE",

His music is a mixture of lyrical storytelling, and golden era aesthetics, and contemporary production. \"I'm influenced by a lot of things and try to touch on subjects I feel are neglected,\" he tells AAHH in an interview.\n\nThe celebrated emcee started off his career making parodies and remixes of radio songs. \"I'm from New Orleans,\" he says, \"so Mac, Fiend, Mystikal, No Limit and the Cash Money camp influenced me,\" he says, also naming Nas, Outkast, and Kendrick Lamar who give him inspiration from to pen songs.\n\nHis journey has been long, with many drops along the way. \"To date, I've released too many projects to remember,\" he says with a laugh. \"I started off under the name Young Duece. After a conversation with a local radio personality, I changed it to the most natural thing I could think of ... my name.\" Some of his past projects include Commercial Break, Best You Never Heard Of, Crashed Harddrive, Super Ugly, Crescent City Classic, and a few others.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5dUIT_MrkUE\n\"Right now, I'm working on collecting original production with no samples,\" he reveals. \"My heart tells me to do samples, but financially that's not the wisest move when it's time for radio, tv, movie and video game placements.\"\n\nHe's received a ton of recognition thus far. \"The Source has covered me, XXL, 2DopeBoyz, BBC, performed in Thailand, London, Aruba and successfully did three national tours all in the last three years.\" That has all been independent, too. \"I've [also] been nominated for and won a few NOLA music awards,\" he says proudly.\n\n\"I record mix and master my music,\" he adds. \"I book my shows and do my PR, all while holding down a full-time job. My studio -- The Hut Studios --has been a local staple for the last decade for some of the best indie artists in the area. In addition to all that I also throw monthly showcases and festivals in the states.\"\n\nHe is quick to note his primary goal as amassing as much influence as possible. \"I want to put my city in the best and most accurate light possible. We're a city full of lyricists, pop artist, and street artist, but to date, only one part of our story has been told prominently. I want to be a part of spreading positivity.\"\n\n\"I'm signed to myself. I don't foresee myself signing any major label deals. I've personally had horror stories and heard twice as many from my peers,\" he says. Next up is more touring. Bigger and better stages. Festivals, TV, and radio are all in play right now.\"\n\n\"It's a great time...even better it's the best time of my career thus far.\"\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgdm5rAcOpA\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amhCytuu9UM\n​",

    "content_html": "[dropcap]K[/dropcap]aiju The Unconquerable is one of those artists that fails to ever settle into anything — in the best way possible. “Episode 7: Ultraman” found it’s way to my inbox this past April, and I was amazed at how different Kaiju’s vibe was. Jarring isn’t quite the right word, but the shift in tone from “<a href=\"http://aboveaveragehiphop.com/indiespotliught-kaiju-the-unconquerable-release-new-short-film/\">CYBERPUNK 2050</a>” to “<a href=\"http://aboveaveragehiphop.com/kaiju-the-unconquerable-returns-with-ultraman-visual/\">Ultraman</a>” should a to of range, with the quality of the video being the constant.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5PXgX6U3Ao&t=212s\n\nHis latest is easily my fave release from him to date. “Episode 8: Got II,” also dubbed “Restoration Of Akumetsu,” sees Kaiju playing the role of a cyber vigilante/assassin who — we learn through the excellent long-form news intro — is slaughtering important officials, earning himself (by the end) $2 billion bounty. As Akumetsu, donning a wild rad mask (who one newscaster described as exploding), he and his cohort Swisha take out a target and everyone in the way. A highlight is right before he first enters the location and cuts off the security guard’s hand.\n\nMuch like his other pieces  — and kind of like “This Is America” by Childish Gambino — his visuals and songs can stand alone. As a juxtaposition to the more easy-going “Ultraman,” which was in many ways more playful and littered with delicious nerd-centric references, Episode 8 is much more aggressive. Upon first listen it was reminiscent of DMX’s aura on his debut record; specifically the chorus put me in mind of “Damian,” so seeing in the credits that it was in fact inspired by X was a neat addition on his part.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/K2JYyml1018\n\nWith a slow trappish instrumental, Kaiju’s flow is impeccable — at one point almost matching the cadence of Kendrick Lamar as he spits: “always intentional, my niggas keep it traditional, yeah you talking the fictional being my words to the physical ... black is beautiful, yeah my people nutritional, they try to kill us with chemicals, lord don’t make me get biblical.”\n\nWhile staying to a similar format, Kaiju manages to continually reinvent his sound, making each piece of his puzzle fit together while also standing out from the crowd. This latest chapter is no different; while I have no idea what this is building towards or the grand vision, I’m excited to see the wonders that Episode 9 holds!\n\nEarly.",

    "content_html": "[dropcap]I[/dropcap]t's all about trusting the journey because sometimes following your gut can take you into unexpected territory. Just ask Queens (New York) rapper Koncept -- one-time Fat Beats employee and former member of the Brown Bag All Stars. He'd built a bankable brand as a solo act, blazing from the onset of his debut LP back at the top of 2012. Having worked his J57 collaborative project <em>The Fuel</em> and having just about wrapped his next LP (which would become <em>14 Hours Ahead</em>), he set off on a short tour in Seoul, the capital of South Korea. That was almost two years ago, and Kon has finally made his return to New York City after what became an unexpected odyssey of overseas fame.\n<h4>RELATED: <a href=\"http://aboveaveragehiphop.com/the-fuel-a-conversation-with-rapper-koncept/\">Read Our 2015 Interview With Koncept [Released In Support Of <em>The Fuel</em>]</a></h4>\n\"I was only supposed to be there for two weeks ... the tour got extended,\" he reveals to AAHH. \"I ended up partnering with Sony Music [Asia], and it was a domino effect into a bunch of things.\" The label made him an offer he couldn't refuse, but as they agreed to release his <em>14 Hours Ahead</em> LP, the deal required him to stick around indefinitely. \"They said they wanted me to stay over there for the rollout of the album, so I could be face to face in the country, play shows, promote my brand and the album.\"\n\nThe LP's success led to a consistent touring schedule. \"I tried to come back a few times,\" he notes. Each time he attempted to return, bookings would pile one, forcing him to abandon the plans. \"This time I was straight up, like, 'all right, I'm going to go back to New York. I'm going to fly out June 20th. Like there are no bookings after June 15th, you know what I mean?'\"\n\n\"I just been nonstop,\" he continues. \"I just finished this new album, and I want to drop these news videos I have ... but I just [needed to] regroup and take a little rest, you know what I mean? Chill for a little bit and then get back into everything.\" The first of these new videos -- there are five in total -- \"Never Again\" is premiering right here on AAHH. \"It's just about not making the same mistakes and learning from your experiences,\" he says of the track, \"just getting rid of all of the negative things in your life, from relationships to friendships, etc.\"\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7C8MEf9o4M\n \nUltimately, he credits his time in Korea with helping him break ground that merely networking online wouldn't have allowed -- which is a big takeaway for any artist considering touring overseas. \"I'm constantly booked ... I play three shows a week. There's a real connection with the people, the fans, and with the industry as a whole out there.\" Though he'd already tasted some initial success stateside, the same success that led him to Korea in the first place, what's he's built over there has been next level. \"Going out there and just being the unicorn, just being different, instantly people gravitated towards it.\" On top of just a hectic live schedule, he also landed numerous print magazine placements and even commercial placements -- notably appearing in Spyder clothing ads that appeared across Asia in movie theatres.\n\n<iframe style=\"border: none; overflow: hidden;\" src=\"https://www.facebook.com/plugins/post.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fkonceptfanpage%2Fposts%2F10155554440076796%3A0&width=500\" width=\"500\" height=\"510\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe>\n\nPerhaps most importantly, it's sparked a whole new wave of creativity for Koncept. \"It's dope because it's in a different place is just really inspiring. You know what I mean? Walking outside every day and just seeing things that I'm not used to, meeting different people ... it's a whole other inspiration.\" As he explains, the outlook has given his music an even more unique vibe than it already had. \"I'm not to trying to be pigeonholed as a New York rapper ... there's a big world out here. I'm trying to be a fucking a global artist, you know, global musician.\"\n<em>\n14 Days Ahead</em> is available everywhere.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81bVx1s2_IA&list=PLbzy_ONMzLCfHuGzQiIK0r6pXgyr5mg8Z",

    "content_html": "[dropcap]I[/dropcap] definitely sift through a lions share of music on a daily basis, so you can understandably assume my skepticism when I hear buzzwords like groundbreaking and forward-thinking when I get press releases or bios. My introduction to Orlando, Florida, rapper Iamzaccp is one such artist that comes across a little strong on paper; to my surprise, however, his debut self-titled LP was a project I found myself spinning on repeat throughout the week.\n\nThe eight-song project -- from the perspective of vibe -- has a great arc to it that shows a surprisingly broad range of versatility. \"Drama,\" the opening track, has an almost paranoid vibe to it, as he navigates his current situation while trying to avoid fake friends and remain sucker free (for lack of a better term). From there the project turns into the portrait of a new wave rapper who has an almost Uncle Murda-esque obsession with having sex with your girlfriend. While not a wholly unique direction to move in musically, records like \"Hot Grits\" and \"Magazines\" are absolute bangers. The latter is littered with fantastic wordplay.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHsuYpEdaEE\n \n\"I got beats in my email, beats working in retail ... pay attention to the details, nigga where is your female,\" he raps.\n\nThe tone shifts from the slowed up \"Secret Society\" onward; that record, in particular, is an ode to amount of work he's put into his craft, earning everything he has. \"I can't tell you my next move, but I can tell you I paid dues,\" he spits. Later on, in the same verse, he also pulls the card on the fake rappers running the scene glorifying a lifestyle they don't live.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YrLRJrkTLHE\n \nWhile not at all softer, \"Wyu2?\" and the story of a love that could never work, \"Set Me Free,\" almost feel like a different guy. Ultimately, you're left to wonder if he's a player that wants to move slightly different.\n\nAs an artist, Iamzaccp is well put together. He's got eight bangers to work with and -- though not unique persay -- he manages to stand out among the pack of other artists I've come across recently. His self-titled project is worth a spin.\n\nhttps://open.spotify.com/album/4MovyQkBwWq36EtrM0EpuH?si=STF7MbEXSzi7QoBv_wrmVA",

    "content_html": "XleoniduZ is an artist that has been featured by me numerous times over the past few years; there is something oddly endearing about the vibe that is hard to put your finger on for sure. The Miami rapper -- unleashing his long-awaited full-length [dropcap]Sin Paradise[/dropcap] -- has chosen to tell a more honest portrayal of the environment that birthed and shaped him as a man. This isn't the flashy Miami Beach you see in overbudget music videos; this is the realness.\n\n\"Every time I have faith I lose my sight,\" he laments on \"Da Sinners Anthem.\" It's honestly one of the album's most telling bar -- with respects to pulling it all together. Across the 11-song effort, XleoniduZ paints the picture of everyday life from the bottom of Dade County. As the protagonist of the relatably gritty first-person accounts, we're presented with this juxtaposed sense of subtly downplayed religious purpose, which is continuously challenged and at times overshadowed by the environment around him.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xsw-QiZeUHw\n \n\"Self God\" is an interesting track that speaks to something XleoniduZ told AAHH; \"Lupe said in his second album 'I love the lord, but sometimes I love me more,' [and] that shit stuck with me forever. The allure of the finer things, takes hold but doesn't always satisfy, as he raps \"why do I have these things and still feel incomplete.\" It's this sentiment, a sense of searching and longing for a shadowy something, that he revisits a few times, just as on \"Take My Pain Away,\" where he attempts to fill a painful void with misguided love.\n\n\"Blasphemy\" is another standout, as a detailed breakdown of the BS being shoved down the throats of many new school rap fans. \"I rather give you life, they rather sell you lies,\" he raps on the chorus. The crown jewel of this LP, though -- aside from \"What Dey Do\" which is a flame emoji and a half -- is the ode to his hometown, \"267,\" which not only stands as the most personal track on an already deeply \"heart on sleeve\" collection of music, the outro serves as a fantastic explainer of the project.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwekQVFjjzM\n \n\"[<em>Sin Paradise</em>] is about me explaining what Miami does to somebody who lives here,\" he says on the \"267\" outro. The project is a remarkably cohesive and well-produced body of work; by the end of the tracklist, you're left to realize that some of the purpose and reason for being that the young emcee is chasing is, in fact, the music you've been bumping. This is art.\n\nEarly.\n\n<iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/playlists/526890264&color=%23ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&show_teaser=true&visual=true\" width=\"100%\" height=\"300\" frameborder=\"no\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe>",

    "content_html": "[dropcap]L[/dropcap]ong Island, New York, singer Alexza is a creative soul down to the bone. So much so, that she couldn’t picture herself doing anything else. “I can’t see myself devoting my time, energy and heart elsewhere,” she tells AAHH. “It’s truly my passion, and I love what I do.”\n\nHer music itself is quite eclectic, refusing to subscribe to one vibe. “I wouldn’t describe the sound at all ... I’m not drawn to one genre. I naturally enjoy creating RnB, pop, hip-hop, rock, urban pop and experimental music,” she explains. “It’s more of a feeling to me that I can’t put into words. If anything I’d say deep, heartfelt, realistic yet experimental.”\n\nShe got involved in music through her parents and uncle; he mother is a power vocalist, and her father played bass guitar in their band. “That’s how they met and introduced music to my siblings and me at a very young age,” she tells us of the endearing love story. “My uncle was the first person to put me in the booth and record my first cover song which was ‘Emotions’ — the version done by Destiny Child.”\n\nAs a testament to her talent, she’s had the privilege to work with storied producer and executive Irv Gotti of Murder Inc — the man responsible for superstars like Ja Rule and Ashanti (among others). “He put out an album soundtrack to his hit TV Series on BET called <i>Tales</i>, and I wrote and recorded music for the show,” she explains. “I’m also featured on a record called ‘Got To Be Real’ with Jim Jones produced by DJ Relly Rell ... It’s off his new album <i>Wasted Talent</i> which is currently available on all streaming platforms.”\n\nhttps://youtu.be/Q1pX34et6kw\n \nhttps://youtu.be/G2ksW5iw8nY\n \nWith the good looks piling up, she is currently working on her debut album <i>The Hybrid</i>, as well as a project with DJ Relly Rell. “In between working on those projects I’ll be releasing a few singles and putting out visuals to my #CouleChronicles material that I post every week on my IG @ListenToAlexza,” she says.\n\n“I’ve gotten so much done working with the legendary Irv Gotti who believes in me so much,” she says of her experience working with the mogul. “I got to learn all about being in control of my music, and I’m genuinely grateful for his support and mentorial guidance.\n\n“My goal is first to be successful. Everything else will follow afterward,” she says confidently. “I want to become the kind of artist that the people can trust and support ... I want to bring my fans music that they can relate to and fall in love with.”\n\nUltimately, she aims to make timeless music. “I’m going to be making [timeless records] and the records that are just for fun and for the moment, so I can be so well rounded and balanced that I become a household brand that’s necessary for the culture.”",

    "content_html": "[dropcap]P[/dropcap]rogression isn't about staying stagnant -- nor is it about abandoning your underlying ideals. This is a sentiment explored in the arc of rapper Tae Groove's new LP, <em>New Waves Old Ways</em>, the 11-song follow up to 2017's <em>Finding Direction</em>. \"This album means a lot to mean cause I took over a year putting it together as far as picking songs etc.,\" the rapper explains to AAHH. \"[Also] I stepped outside my comfort zone a lot on the project.\"\n\nWhile not completely night and day, as Tae seems to have the same energy, the vibe of this project is noticeably different; the flow structure has been tweaked, and in many spots -- like \"Lifestyle\" and \"The Weekend\" -- are much more melodic in nature.\n\nThere are a few topical regions he explores, from following his own path among the adversities of his environment (\"Livin My Life\"), winning by staying true to his vision (\"Plan\"), Love (\"Saved\") -- and repenting on past mistakes (\"Can I Live\"). Overall, the aura is relatable with enough depth to find gems in his bars with repeated spins.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQ-fupZQtQU\n \n\"Livin My Life\" actually comes across as the standout; its almost anthemic chant of trusting the process as prescribed by your own soul has an almost sense of rebirth to it that really plays well to the album's theme of new beginnings (waves).\n\nUltimately, New Waves Old Ways is movement music for anyone trying to make it this game -- and any game, for that matter. You can't expect to take the same steps repeatedly and achieve different results. Tae is making his way and investing a lot into his grind independently -- diversifying his sound along the way without losing his footing. The album closers \"Take It Slow\" and the testament to his grind \"No Sleep\" pretty much say it all.\n\n<iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/playlists/551272647&color=%23ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&show_teaser=true&visual=true\" width=\"100%\" height=\"300\" frameborder=\"no\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe>",

One of the cool things about his is his ability to traverse different sounds and vibes without sounding forced or off-base.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/Ii46wtjYLB8\n \n<blockquote>I put in a lot of work this year and wanna see it pay off.</blockquote>\nWhen asked, the rapper notes that his sound is epic. “I like doing what I feel; how ever the music moves me — I react,” he explains. “I don't judge the outcome. If I could define my style, I would say it's rap realist music.”\n\nHis first taste of music was back in college, trying to write and record for his cousin. “I bought an 8-track recorder and laid my first full verse,” he recalls fondly. After that, “ I was hooked.” Fast forward, and L'S810 is 14 projects deep. I’ve been grinding for a minute,” he says with a laugh.\n\n“Right Now I’m just recording and writing ... got a few singles under my sleeve,” he states. However, he isn’t committing to anything just yet. “Going with the flow for now and creating.\n\n“Really proud of the content we have produced these [past few] years; I would say the biggest accomplishment was raising the level of content — now we just need more eyes on it,” he adds with a smirk.\n\n“I wanna become super successful and touch millions and help more individuals become the greatest them,” he says of his ultimate career goals. “I want hella platinum hits and a collection of classic albums under my belt ...

    "content_html": "[dropcap]I[/dropcap]t’s been a process for young Houston-bred MC Tedy Andres; he’s been bubbling up over the past few years, setting the stage for his upcoming release, which is poised to change everything. “I've been rapping since I was like 13,” he tells AAHH, “that was ten years ago, man., man.\n\n“It's been a slow build,” he continues. “I released a project called <i>Mad Illusions</i> and started getting a little buzz off the song called ’Mercedes.’” He rode that buzz and aside from multiple online nods, captured the attention of industry heavyweight Sha Money XL.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/A7hxBw4zG-U\n \nSha was a producer for 50 Cent at his (musical) peak, and served as president of G-Unit Records, before taking the helm as VP of A&R at Def Jam in 2010. Currently working as an executive at Epic Records, he is currently managing Tedy.\n\n“That's like a big brother to me,” Tedy says of working with the storied executive. “We got a great relationship, he's a top 5 A&R in the game, you know what I mean? So sending him records and getting his opinion is always good.\n\n“He's was a businessman,” he adds. “We've been working hard together,” he notes.\n\nHis latest release, “Ominous,” is a song that is setting the stage for his upcoming project. “My producer [Kill] and I locked in the studio and ade that beat together,”’he explains. “I just had some inspiration a couple of days after ... it’s a storytelling vibe about a couple of people I know.”\n\nhttps://youtu.be/NhSBExNaIus\n \nHe cautions not to get too comfortable with the vibe of “Ominous,” as he’s definitely diversifying his vibe. “I don't really have a title for it yet ... I'm kinda keeping it under wraps,” he says of the LP. “I’ve been making a bunch of records, and hopefully around October I can get this [album] out.\n\n“There's going to be different types of things,” he explains. “I mean, it's going to be lifestyle, it’s going to be storytelling ... I'm trying to make new, different types of records. I've just been making a bunch of songs and they all sound a little different, but I'm going to wait til everything sonically go together.”\n\nOne producer he’s worked with is Harlem’s own V-Don — who we’ve chatted with in the past. His sound is quite dark, but Tedy is clear that he is trying to brighten things up this time around.\n\n<h4>Related: Read our V-Don interview, here.</h4>\n\n“I don't want to do something so dark because my last project was a little dark ... I was kind of in a dark place for it,” he says. “I don't even want to put it in a box right now because I've been making so many records.“\n\nTedy has lots lined up, including a host of new videos that will line up with the release of the new project. Ultimately, he just wants this album to be an enduring, timeless piece of art.\n\n“I just want to be the best,” he exclaims without hesitation. “I want people to love it. I want it to be a classic, you know what I mean?”\n\nhttps://youtu.be/qO9Punr12e8",

    "content_html": "[dropcap]T[/dropcap]here is something inherently perfect about the right soundtrack for your movements at the right time. In a wave of commercial Hip Hop -- with the genre being at its absolute height regarding actual quantifiable popularity -- it may be hard to explain to someone why instrumental LPs are so vital for your soul. But in the word of King Push: \"if you know you know.\"\n\nI continuously thirst for new instrumental soundtracks, and French producer/poet/creative Han Sino is someone that I've covered in the past -- in particular his project titled <em>Glucose</em>. He creates this refreshing blend of funk grooves, jazz, ambient hip-hop, and atmospheric melodies that seriously make for a trippy experience, dependant on how you consume his ambitious projects.\n<h6><strong>Relevant: <a href=\"http://aboveaveragehiphop.com/french-nu-soul-producer-han-sino-drops-new-lp/\">Check out the run-down of Han's LP Glucose</a></strong></h6>\nHis latest output, <em>Exquisite </em>Gardenz, is one which Han himself considers to be his opus. Much like his previous release -- during my first few listens, I noticed that the core bass lines created that signature continuous flow that moved the 12-song soundscape along. The best way to describe this project is that if a crate digger were to randomly come across this during a record shop excursion, and take it home and drop the needle anywhere, they'd be excited as hell to fire up the MPC and start chopping. It's gorgeous.\n\nBeginning with the atmospheric intro track \"Exquisite,\" we're introduced to an Asian influence that creeps in throughout the project. The second track \"Red Fishes\" gave me chills off the top, as the bassline was reminiscent of the iconic bass strums from Eric B. & Rakim's \"Don't Sweat The Technique.\" Rather than commit to a hip-hop-centric platter, though, it expands into this difficult to describe Sunday afternoon, soulful, 70's vibe -- accentuated with these ambient wind chimes that make for a crazy audio trip.\n\nLater on in the tracklist, I found myself drawn to the mysterious vibe of \"Deep Lagoonz,\" with an almost video game vibe, set-off with this super cool flute, and some frantic strings that add this odd amount of tension to track. The strings in the album closer \"Gardenz\" also had me intrigued; groovy, jazzy, and insanely engrossing.\n\nAs Han himself says in the album's liner notes, \"I hope you will [take] this Opus as a proposition to see life differently, and bite it to the fullest ... drunk of the liquor of paradise.\" This should be the goal of any great instrumental affair -- a soundtrack to the movie that is your life; whether you're getting lost in a world of writing or banging it which you're trekking through the metropolis after dark. <em>Exquisite Gardenz</em> is a beautiful body of work. If you're into nu jazz, rare groove, or a fan of instrumental hip-hop, you'll want to give it a spin.\n\n<iframe style=\"border: 0; width: 400px; height: 472px;\" src=\"https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=2624084698/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/artwork=small/transparent=true/\" seamless=\"\"><a href=\"http://hansino.silentnwise.com/album/exquisite-gardenz\">Exquisite Gardenz by Han Sino</a></iframe>",

    "content_html": "[dropcap]N[/dropcap]erd-centric Hip Hop is a lucrative niche, to say the least. The genius of it is that unlike other sub-genres, listeners within this demographic are prone to intense fandom and financial support of shit that they feel; to that end, they are amazing fans to amass. The problem, though, lies in making the crossover. That -- of course -- refers to the delicate balance that exists between traditional Hip Hop and that which is littered with comic and game references to the point that it obscures itself, stifling an artist's ability to compete on a mainstream level.\n\nYoung New York upstart Outcastkid is on a quest to break the mold with his latest LP, <em>Nerd DNA</em>. He first came onto our radar when he dropped a remix of the Smoke DZA and Joey Badass collaboration, \"Mood.\" While that track didn't accurately establish the nerdism this LP encapsulates, it did give us a taste of his cadence and flow — which is trenched in a New York sound.\n<h6>RELEVANT: <a href=\"http://aboveaveragehiphop.com/the-outcastkid-salutes-nyc-with-new-remix/\">Check out his \"Mood\" remix</a></h6>\nReminiscent of an artist he has an affinity for, Joey Badass (he even mentions the rapper on the song \"I'ma Get Mine\"), Outcast's music is built around lots of complex wordplay. Interestingly, the thematic context of the project seems to shift as it rolls on, from \"nerdy\" to more of the everyday portrait of a high school underdog engrossed in Hip Hop culture.\n\nTo illustrate this take, we look at tracks like \"Shock Jockey,\" which plays up a concept he also rolled out online, building himself as a character who was experimented on as part of a secret government project. Then there's \"Rick and Morty's Outcast,\" laden with punchlines from the popular show -- sure to make fans drool.\n\nhttps://open.spotify.com/track/37TfeiwdqTLuEU9sbpslkW\n \nThat's the nerdy shit, though.\n\nSongs like \"Outcast Vibe\" and \"Bad Girls\" see him lusting after girls as -- more or less -- that every-man in the back of the class that they don't notice. He laments, especially on the latter track, how popping off in the industry will have all these girls that once overlooked him taking a second (or third) look.\n\nThen bangers like \"Indigo Smoke\" -- a clear highlight -- and \"Printer Life\" seem to also portray this weed smoking kid with confidence and swag. It's a weird juxtaposition that ultimately illustrates the multiple relatable facets to this kid's personality (as a rapper), which plays out quite organically. This is even true as he switches gears for a trap vibe on \"Cash Flex,\" for example.\n\nUltimately, what I like about this kid is his willingness to be deceivingly diverse while staying on topic. Sure, he raps about video games, comics, and other overt nerd shit, but he also creates this relatable young guy aura -- kind of like Khalid -- and he has pretty dope pen game. It will be interesting to see if he continues to run with the \"nerd rap guise\"; this album is (actually) less \"nerdy\" than he may consider it to be. At points, it’s actually just “smart.” Solid listen.\n\nEarly.\n\nhttps://open.spotify.com/album/0kOCjipzRCWC3OuApmGh7m",

    "content_html": "[dropcap]2[/dropcap]7-year-old American Cedar Rapids MC Noah Wright is back with another super dope video treatment. First popping onto our radar back in March with his short film \"Valley of the Sun\" -- and with his super dope LP <em>Love, Noah</em>. From opening for Rakim, Rick Ross, Futuristic and working with Young Money's very own Cory Gunz, he's definitely on a run, and we're here for it.\n\n<h4>Relevant: <a href=\"http://aboveaveragehiphop.com/infectiously-optimistic-meet-rapper-noah-wright/\">Check out our March 2018 Noah Wright feature</a></h4>\n\nHis latest video for his sure-shot single \"Cameras\" is next level creative. It begins with a plot reminiscent of the iconic episode of Fresh Prince of Bel Air when Will and Buddy were trying to be in the BBD video being shot while Phil and Viv were away. In this video, the cleaner keeps trying to be in the shot, interrupting the shoot to the point that Noah storms off. That's the opening skit, though. As the actual video kicks off, we're introduced to gorgeous models, a luxury car, and that same interrupting cleaner is playing out a virtual reality plotline that eventually intertwines with his performance shots.\n\nIt's the type of creativity we've come to expect from Noah who's been dropping some fire lately. The short and sweet \"El Chapo,\" which he dropped back in June, and the intensely powerful visual for \"No Room\" have been building his profile -- his quality is next level.\n\nCheck out \"Cameras\" above, and be sure to follow Noah via Twitter.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfcJ9Wv94vU\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0uRcvnnhc4",

    "content_html": "[dropcap]A[/dropcap] new LP floated across my desk by an Oakland, California, singer/rapper named MusicbyKO. A warm blend of jazzy 90s Hip Hop and a cadence reminiscent of acts like Isaiah Rashad. Having shared stages with names like J.I.D. and Earthgang, he appears focused and composed -- as evidenced by <em>Life In Element</em>, his new LP.\n\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"300\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" allow=\"autoplay\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/playlists/595474635&color=%23ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&show_teaser=true&visual=true\"></iframe>\n \nWith a very consistent sound, KO slowly unravels a series of tracks that let you into his world just enough -- without blatant TMI, or inducing a \"yeah right\" effect. What listeners get are the tales of a low-level drug dealer (this is both referenced and downplayed at different points), who is taking a chance on a dream, as he slowly but surely uncovers that everything the glimmers isn't gold, and just because someone calls you brother, it doesn't mean they have your back -- or at the very least even your best interests at heart.\n\nIt's an almost paranoid sense that snakes are roaming the grass that is revisited numerous times throughout the project, like on the song \"La La Land,\" \"Empathy,\" and \"Let Me Talk With Ya/While I'm Here,\" where he notes \"I Know niggas right now that want to see me fall.\"\n\nHe also paints a picture of himself as someone who overextends himself -- such as on \"Too Much Falls Short,\" where he preaches that failing to leave your comfort zone is a fail before even leaving the running block.\n\nThat's just the first few layers of this project; touching on socio-economic issues facing the black community nationwide, and even relationships (see the super dope \"Spirit Rise\"), he creates a lot of depth. Though the vibe is consistent -- almost bordering on redundant -- it manages to remain engaging. Also, that instrumental on \"A Devil's Advocate Corner\" is a bucket of flame emojis doused in gasoline.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMTlL8pFLDI\n \nLike a bride on her wedding day, <em>Life In Element</em> is something old and something new; all that Hip Hop is dead shit goes out teh window when you hear younger cats with cohesive projects like this. With enough amazing quotables to create a success Instagram daily quote account (\"I couldn't heal in eth place I got sicker\") and an admirable ear for production, MusicbyKO NEEDS to be on your radar. It's just good for the soul.\n\nEarly.",

The Treelag-produced visual treatment maintains an intriguing super eight camera aesthetic with its glitchy transitions and sporadic effects that almost feel like a malfunctioning security camera. The Handycam aura gives it a really dope vibe.\n\n\"I been feeling good, I been feeling great,\" the chorus echoes before adding that they've been chilling and smoking backwoods. The overall \"living my best life\" schtick is infectious; it creates an earworm that begs for playlist placement.\n\nCheck out the visual, above.",

[that] you can't go after what you believe in. This is a big fuck you,\" he explains.\n\n\"I was working really hard on things and I was sort of in a place where I had no choice but to wait for something to happen ... I was in a funk,\" he said of the song's creative inception.\n\nCurrently in the Los Angeles putting the finishing touches on his new album, Koncept shares that he is planning to come out strong after the final three visuals in this latest run are released; his roll-out includes an Asian tour with Scoop DeVille that kicks off in November with stops in Korea, Japan, Thailand, and Vietnam. Intriguingly, he also describes plans for a collaborative project with the \"Poetic Justice\" producer.\n\nCheck out Koncept's \"Fuck You Music\" video, above.",

MTV Rap Asia's <i>Rap</i> <i>Cypher</i>, knocking out her first festival appearance, and dropping a buzzing new single titled \"Z vs Z\" ahead of the upcoming EP of the same name, she is primed and ready to take things to the next level.\n\n\"Hip Hop in Malaysia has grown exponentially throughout 30 plus years,\" she explains to AAHH, indulging our ignorance of the regional scene. \"I didn't live through the early stages of this groundbreaking period in the Malaysian music industry, but one characteristic of Hip Hop is its continuous evolution in sound, style, and swagger.\n\n\"It doesn’t matter if you jump on the Hip Hop bandwagon in the 80s or 2000s; if you have something to say -- visually, lyrically or sonically -- you're a part of the culture,\" she adds.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3mbnpd5nsk\n \nAs Z explains, Malaysian society's reaction towards Hip Hop has been somewhat of a gradual appreciation. She fell in love with the culture in her late teens. \"Love, heartbreak and all the sweet sins of adolescence brought me to Hip Hop; and now I’m in it for life.\"\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/BkMzNXzALI-/\n\nShe's accomplished a lot -- considering her debut video dropped just over a year and a half ago. This year, she was blessed with the opportunity to journey to the US to develop and focus her craft, and her career. It was here that <i>Z</i> <i>vs</i>. <i>Z</i> was born.\n\n\"It was a very reflective period for me,\" she notes of the experience. \"I did all of the creative work while I was there. I worked with the amazing producer Floyd “Timeless” Thomas, writing the lyrics. I also teamed up with the ever so talented creative director -- Kanya Iwana -- and the most brilliant ALL FEMALE TEAM, Savannah Chonis, Francesca Martin, Nawel Abdelaziz, and Shaina Santos for the album artwork.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pWonLls2i2I\n \n\"The experience was humbling, overwhelming and stimulating,\" she adds. I was given a chance by Lakefront Records, which resulted in the recording of this EP in the United States [specifically, Chicago]. It was overwhelming because I was in a foreign place, where EVERYONE is trying to make it. Stimulating, because of the work ethic that I managed to experience. The entertainment industry is no joke, and that motivated me to do more for myself as an artist.\"\n\nThe new EP, as she explains, is the essence of her as an artist, stemming from reflection and acceptance -- two things she describes as dominant themes in her writing. \"It took about two months for the idea to be translated into the entire project,\" she reveals.\n\nDuring her recent appearance at the Good Vibes Festival in Selangor, Malaysia, she had a chance to debut her two-month labor of love in front of a receptive audience -- an experience she doesn't take for granted.\n\n\"That was a day of many firsts. The first time I performed at a festival, first time I used in-ear monitors, first time performing with dancers, first time I played the entire EP LIVE,\" she exclaims proudly. \"I’ve learned to let go of the things I don’t have control over -- but all in all, it was an adventure of a lifetime.\"\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/Blj5L7lgxJD/\n\nWith a dizzying 2018 thus far -- and an even more jarring 2019 ahead -- Zamaera's current mood is focusing on her mind, body, and soul. With an endorsement deal with Nike Malaysia, her project, and (if it all pans out the right way) a tour, you can hardly blame her for cherishing a little downtime.\n\n\"Follow me on my social media,\" she says as our interview draws to a close, \"because I will be announcing something extremely exciting very soon.”\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/BogmF2XAlsv/\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/Bn9ChNxg2Sq/",

    "content_html": "[dropcap]W[/dropcap]hen it comes to career longevity without selling out the original vision — and ultimately the core integrity — of your brand, no OG rappers have managed to continue rocking shit the way that way Sadat X (a third of Brand Nubian) and El Da Sensei of The Artifacts have. Longtime fixtures on the European scene, the two have been peers for years, but it wasn’t until three years ago that the two decided to bless longtime fans and deep-rooted Hip Hop heads with a joint LP titled XL.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/2OzjbrZZZs8\n \n“I've known X since the 90s and been a fan since day one,” El Da Sensei tells AAHH. “We have mutual friends as well ... they all said ‘hey why don't Y'all do an LP together that would be crazy.’ We agreed.“\n\nWith well over two decades in the game, El explains it’s his love of the sport of Hip Hop that keeps him dedicated to his craft. “I think we show longevity working with new producers and keeping a fresh sound; we’re not compromising to fit in,” he says of this collaboration. “We try to set trends rather than follow,” he adds.\n\n“That keeps the fans inspired. We still love it and its also a job....gotta love what you do right?”\n\nTheir love is evident. A peruse of either of the rappers Instagram illustrates them living their best lives; from wine to merch, they’ve been able to endure through countless eras and trends since first rising to prominence with their respective crews.\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/BpYRlCbHYFZ\n \n“You have to love the craft and be a participant cant sit on the sidelines warming the bench,” he explains. “We have merch out there, continuous releases ... you have to be working even more than before. There are so many outlets to use now. We can sell ourselves more than ever.”\n\n“You have to be yourself ... nobody can be me and X. So we push that still!”\n\nWhen it came the delayed (but worth the wait) LP, El notes that every verse they laid made the cut. “Every song made it except for the one we leaked, ‘We Must Stand’ prod by 9th Wonder. We have a song on deck ready for the next single as a bonus, but everything made the final version,” he says.\n\nFans who have come expect feverish release schedules from the duo (individually) have lots to look forward to — in addition to a tour of the USA and one in Europe kicking off March 2019. “We definitely working on the next XL project immediately,” El says with a laugh. “I have about 4 albums ready to go on deck for the next 2 years ... I’ve been busy.”",

[he] will be on it, and he’ll be helping to guide it, but it’s not gonna be all him. I’m gonna have guest producers, and there’s gonna be more interaction with different MCs.”\n\nThe duo promise the impending album, <em>Aireplane</em>, will be cinematic in nature, with multiple layers of complex rhyming sure to make real heads — and longtime fans — swoon. That is set to dro this winter (though no exact date is confirmed). For now, we can look forward to <em>Live From The Aireport FreEP</em> this Thanksgiving.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/SRhJ03SN2zU",

As always, the quality is high, and while interspersed with cartoonish overlays to give it a comic feel, there are actual quick cuts to fully animated Anime sequences, adding to the overall visual complexity of the treatment.\n\nI’ve brought this up pretty much every time I share this guys shit, but the songs are always standalone even without the visual treatment. Subtract the video, and the track itself is fun as hell, filled with his usual brand of nerdery, intertwined with a plethora of penis punchlines and puns, like how she calls his D “ridiculous,” or how he’s not British but has a “BBC.”\n\nThe tone itself, aside from the more humorous tone, is more in line with a joint like “Ultraman,”\nIn contrast to the more aggressive aura of his last installment, “Got II.” There has yet to be a collective body of work, but it’s definitely going to be an absolute banger.\n\nAll in all, this guy remains a gem secret worth discovering.

As he explains, his brother's success in the industry is what ultimately inspired him to pick up the pen. “I wrote my first songs that same night and its been a snowball effect since then.”\n\nThe Panama-born artist is quick to point out Bone Thugs N Harmony as his biggest influence. “They came up at a time where they were able to be sponges for everything that was going on in music ... they were really the best examples of taking sounds and making them your own that had a heavy influence on me.”\n\nhttps://soundcloud.com/dafeaux_damos/sirdripalot\n \nTo date, he’s dropped five projects: three with a group called <em>DAFEAUXNITO</em> and the others were more recent releases titled<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span><em>27 DAYS</em> and <em>demotape</em>.\n\n“I am currently working on my album OMNIPURPLE,” he reveals. “I decided that after everything that took place in one year it was only right I ended things on a high note. This album will serve as my first impression as both a re-branded artist and a blueprint to my creative process.\n\nHis goal in the industry is to continue paving the way for new artists to embrace the freedom of being more than one thing. “I purposely used the word ‘OMNI’ for my album, which is Latin for (of all things) to introduce my current state of mind as a being of all things.”\n\nSo what’s next?\n\n“Owning my own label would be the next thing professionally,” he says defiantly. “I want to establish a strong foundation for my sound so it can be called home by myself and others just like me.”\n\nhttps://open.spotify.com/album/565NCb",

    "content_html": "[dropcap]D[/dropcap]uo Prototype & Lazarus The Kid Just dropped a new project, and believe me, it’s worth a spin. On a rainy day, I rode around giving this one a fair shake and was taken for more of a journey than I expected.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span>\n\nThe concise EP is immensely musical, with these lush, expansive musical landscapes for Prototype to literally bleed his heart out upon; there is no hyperbole in the emotion packed within these five tracks. Atop soulful samples, energetic drum patterns, and pretty piano keys, there’s a sense of loss and sadness that lingers amongst the celebration and assertion of the dream chase.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span>\n\nImmediately on the heartfelt “Color,” we’re introduced to demise of a powerful relationship in Prototypes life — one which he gave his all to, and once thought would possibly end in marriage. It’s a loss that is later encapsulated with an emotionally charged piano interlude brimming with a heavy-hearted sense of despair.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span>\n\nThere’s also the loss of Jason Kalinga, who is actually featured “Simba.” The second verse of “Better Way” is a letter to his lost friend, who was another powerful figure in his life.\n\nAmongst the deep moments standing as an endearing open book into his world, there is an incredible sense of confidence; Prototype is chasing the vision in his head — and it’s hard to imagine anyone attempting to detract him from his vision after taking in this project.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span>\n\nEnding off with the crown jewel, “November 15,” Prototype & Lazarus The Kid position themselves as exciting artists putting out music with not only a purpose<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>but a strong sense of its emotional connection. They know what they're doing, and it’s something that hinges more on the artistic merit side of things than the trendy shit. This isn’t for cool points, it’s a therapeutic listen made for longevity. This is a catalog worth keeping an eye on.\n\nhttps://open.spotify.com/album/4A1aZn7rUf1KiKvW6RhbrA?si=GnLGWrKjRi2whAUNO5o6GQ",

    "content_html": "[dropcap]E[/dropcap]very once in a while you come across an artist who falls outside the box of industry convention; by that I — of course — an artist who doesn’t seem motivated by the basics that have poisoned the soul of the culture. An artist that puts his music first. Brooklyn MC Krhazey Whytheycallhimthat is one of those artists. “A positive change in consciousness has the power to topple barriers almost as easy as a negative change creates them,” he tells AAHH describing his mantra for creating.\n\nIf that doesn’t create an immediate sense of urgency for his music, then I don’t know what to tell you.\n\nOff the bat, there is something endearing about his admirable need for not only a purpose but to give back. Early on in his career, he began volunteering his time — and his unique brand of Hip Hop to the 25-year-old Art Start. The program dedicates itself to New York City’s underserved youth, delivering consistent creative workshops inside homeless shelters, alternative to incarceration programs, and partnering youth agencies.\n\n“The program gave me a sense of direction, understanding and a hope for change; real change in myself and my environment,” he says.\n\nhttps://open.spotify.com/album/6eH7Qk6IYGVtX3FOYDm9va?si=R0ZctxsoSPu-FPN_PSW8sQ\n \nWhat I find so cool about his music is the way that it all seems to contrast and compliment itself at the same time. His latest joints are a great example. “Jack Frost” for example has this bouncy ballad behind it, paired with these haunting lyrics that have this almost literal intention of describing this cold-heartedness developed though...well...life. Then there’s “23:5,” which has this almost “Marvin’s Room” feel to it — complete with a call to his ex. But it spirals into this realization that the liquor is a crutch, followed an aggressive assertion of the path before him.\n\nThen the vibe of his latest “Makeda” is a pseudo-love track with hella depth, and again a completely different vibe.\n\nEverything I hear from this kid I like. Even going back to the summer, with his super dope single/video “BTD,” with it’s kind of goofy visual concept.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/DBnJlkVsCok\n \nWithout being driven by the same old, his music has this certain unspoken originality to it. Even the fact that he rocks an anime-inspired kung-fu headband ends up coming across like DOOM’s mask in a sense. It’s hard not to get into.\n\nAnd the spirit of giving back, which inspired him to start his own foundation — Young Heroes Undefeated — is an added layer that makes you want to root for him. “We make original comic books for children with special needs and use the profits to send the kids and their families on all expense paid vacations,” he explains of the foundation’s mission.\n\nWith a four comic series being released next year — on top of a solo LP and a project from my his Audio Temple — there is a lot to look forward to here. He’ll be launching a kickstarter for his foundation in coming weeks; stay tuned to our Instagram for details on how to support something positive.",

    "content_html": "[dropcap]T[/dropcap]here have been many eras in Hip Hop, but none as forgotten as the Nubian era, which was characterized by a heightened sense of knowledge of self and anti-oppressive forces that be. The ironic commercial appeal of empowering groups like Public Enemy or Brand Nubian eventually morphed into the current era where “rap” has become a business move/career choice rather than a voice of the underdog filled with subversive talking points that rival university lectures.\n\nThis is what I found so intriguing about the new project Black Rome by Dough the Freshkid — representing Crenshaw, California. The follow up to his free tape Six Shots and released via his independent label Every Penny Count, the 15-song effort is a blend of vibes, ranging from an early millennium G-Unit mixtape structure (see the chorus on “Cookin’”), 90s east coast soundscapes (see “We Rich” with its scratch hook), to deeply reflective contextual content aimed at giving opposing viewpoints to widely accepted “fact.”\n\nhttps://youtube.com/watch?v=xRRQk9t3LGc\n\n \nAn example of this is the title track, which focuses on the idea that a false image of “white Jesus” was shaped by artist Leonardo DaVinci. Its execution is reminiscent of similar records, such as “Why Is That” by BDP and “Nature Of The Threat” by Ras Kass. This song could literally be transcribed into an incredibly compelling University level essay.\n\nhttps://youtube.com/watch?v=rpdO1G487_k\n\n \nElsewhere on the record, he traverses themes such as the (historical) political and social-economic climate in the United States (see “God’s Curse” verse two) to gang life in LA. Nothing is ever glorified, and everything comes off as methodically thoughtful. On the track “I See He Blued Up,” he addresses industry Crippin,’ as well as unnecessary killing in the streets. “Man up, out the choppas down and out your hands up,” he raps, pointing to the glorification of needless gun violence.\n\nhttps://youtube.com/watch?v=qpnPCVp2218\n\n \nSome of the standouts include the gorgeous instrumental that rides with the top down on “Palm Trees II” featuring Tropic626— which I found myself revisiting quite a few times this week — and the unspoken dopeness of “Still Arlington (1994)” which featured Wee Dogg.\n\n“I never promote crack in my raps, I only promote facts in my raps,” he implores as the project comes to a close with the dramatically honest, autobiographical “Sincerely Me.” Even at its most informative and reflective, Dough manages to make this project an incredibly digestible gem packed with lots of wisdom and great talking points. Worth a spot on your end of year playlist if you’re looking for some undeniable fire that is still creeping under the radar.",

    "content_html": "[dropcap]S[/dropcap]traight out of scenic Vancouver BC, self-produced/engineered artist Krewz is on the verge of taking his career to the new plateau. With a new mixtape dropping the top of 2019, and a tour being planned as we speak, he’s taking the success he’s seen thus far and pumping up the notoriety.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span>\n\n“I started by buying my own equipment, and learning most of my skills online,” he tells AAHH from his studio in BC. “I started rapping with friends ... and [from there] just worked on developing my craft. Back when I first started, I had a set up in my basement, and I was locked in the studio 24/7.”\n\nAs he denotes, that experience helped him realize this was the path he was meant to take — and not just as a hobby, but a full-blown lifestyle.\n\n“I want my mixtape to open up new avenues for potential features with other artists,” he says, switching gears and looking ahead to 2019. With his first single from the project, “Adapt,” an anthem for anyone on the heavy grind regardless of the circumstances, he’s setting the tone in a heavy way.\n\n“I’m like an alien, yeah I adapt,” he says on the chorus, emphasizing the malleable nature of his money mission. The self-produced radio-ready banger features YBN’s own Migo Domingo, who is coming off of a huge summer mixtape release that featured his single “Dog Her” alongside his labelmate and childhood friend Offset.\n\nIt's a lateral movement if you've been following his movements over the past year, as he's been dropping a heap of bubbling singles via his SoundCloud account. Songs like \"No Time,\" which wound up on World Star, have been helping him click, setting the stage for this new project.\n\nhttps://soundcloud.com/krewzofficial/krewz-no-time-1\n\nIt’s a good look associating his brand with YBN -- after a few spins, with it’s super catchy instrumental — we're sure you'll agree worth a spot on whatever playlist you have access to.\n\nCheck out Krewz’ “Adapt,” below.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mjZt6Qp9uQ8&feature=youtu.be",

    "content_html": "[dropcap]A[/dropcap] lot of curious indie projects have landed across my desk this year, but this week one of most unique made its way to my AirPods. 27-year-old RetroPOP passed me his latest effort, <em>RetroPOP Vol 1 This For Amir</em> — a 19-song serving of nostalgic Hip Hop vibes, wrapped in an endearing subplot of family history.\n\nCurated to sound like it’s either a vintage TV flipping through decades of history or stops for some sort of funky time machine, Retro rips through tons of classic samples. The album intro for example — “Burnell’s Intro ‘92” — which has the baseline of Jade’s “Don’t Walk Away” blended in “T.R.O.Y.” His wordplay too is phenomenally engaging. He sounds like a student of the game, with a flow that doesn’t sound forced to nest itself seamlessly into the vintage vibes.\n\nAs an older head, there were some pleasant surprises on the project, such as “NY Undercover ‘94,” a short and sweet story told from the perspective of New York police Detectives J.C. Williams and Eddie Torres — the protagonists of the show New York Undercover — set to the show’s iconic theme song. Then there’s “the story of the prince ‘90,” which sees Retro ripping through the theme song of seminal sitcom Fresh Prince Of Belair to tell the real story of the show that changed Will Smith’s life. He even added a clip from an episode I still can’t watch without crying a little [see below.]\n\nAnother cool track was “House Party 90,” which has a New Jack Swing sound as he rips from Kid’s perspective — from the cult-classic film “House Party” — sneaking out of his home to attend Play’s epic party.\n\nThen there are these deeply personal tracks such as the Charles Allen Freestyle ‘60, a song for his “Paw Paw.” During the final checkpoint, in case the listener hadn’t quite caught it yet, we discover that Amir is his nephew. Which makes the chronicling of his family’s story alongside all these walks down the pop-culture that helped shape him, that much more meaningful. Entenched with themes of cultural identity, flanked with check in points — and even including a heartfelt poem — it’s journey that leaves you relishing for an era that’s long gone. Yet you walk away oddly optimistic for the culture going forward based on the creativity of the trip.\n\nOverall, it’s a recommended slice of Hip Hop worth giving your time to, especially if you grew up in the 90s and hold a soft spot for some of the era’s defining moments.\n\nhttps://soundcloud.com/itspoplock/sets/retropop-this-is-for-amir",

    "content_html": "[dropcap]G[/dropcap]rowing up in Gary, Indiana — infamous as the birthplace of the legendary singer Michael Jackson — rapper D-Brown found the largest influence in something that was all around him, struggle. “Growing up with less than everyone else always fueled me to go harder in everything I do,” he says. Creating what he calls inspirational street music centered around themes of self-elevation, he’s crafting rag-to-riches for the everyman over a trap and soulful beats.\n\n“Since a kid I’ve used writing music as an outlet for me emotionally,” he says of his introduction into music. “Music was an outlet for me; after I recorded my first song [during] my senior year I never looked back.” Since then, he’s released four mixtapes: <em>Same Hustle New Money</em>, <em>My Struggle Made My Hustle</em>, <em>Memoirs Of A Hustla</em>, and <em>New Year Same Hustle New Money</em>”.\n\nHe’s currently preparing his debut full-length LP <em>Eli Made Me Do It</em>, slated for a first-quarter release [2019]. His buzz has been electric, having been touring for the past few years to an ever-growing fanbase. Most endearing to fans is his undeniable sense of authenticity that he’s bringing to his trap sounds.\n\n“I’m making trap music with a message and not just mumbling anything behind a trap beat,” he notes.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span>\n\nThough he’s still early in his career, the Gary-native is looking towards the future; “after making headway in the industry I plan on making the right investments so I can live comfortably even after music runs its course,”\n\nhe states confidently. With no plans on going major — but, rather, remaining indie — he’s working towards developing a team to help take his vision (and brand) to the next level.\n\n“I’m building a team of professionals around me to a work as a small machine until we are in the position to negotiate with the big heads for larger partnerships,” he explains.\n\nOn top of the highly-anticipated new release, he’s developing his merch line, which he admits has been a profitable revenue stream for him, as well as continuing to build out his one-stop-shop website, which he calls his online trap house.\n\nD-Brown is on the rise, and he’s doing it his way! In the meantime, check out his latest single, “Put A Ring On It.”\n\nhttps://youtu.be/o3qK79FWNV8",

    "content_html": "[dropcap]T[/dropcap]his week, we’re introducing you to Provincetown, Massachusetts, native Silas Luster — a filmmaker and hip-hop artist, who’s part of a bubbling creative collective called The BuLife. “I make music that is true to me,” he tells AAHH. “The inspiration from my everyday life, where I’m from, and what I’ve experienced so far in my life goes into music ... it’s real and it’s vulnerable.”\n\n“There is content and emotion only my close friends know, things that I don’t like to speak on, that I put in my music,” he adds.\n\nWe initially got into Silas over the holidays after he floated me a visual for a “ZeZe” freestyle, that had this hard to explain flow that had us intrigued. We uncovered lots of quality stuff while digging around.\n\n“I like to show people a different perspective,” he says. “I know my sound is different, my story has layers to it ... if you give my music a little effort, you will understand my dedication and the depth in my artwork.”\n\nhttps://youtu.be/k_-ddA9D-Qw\n \nSilas has been making both films and music since a youngster — messing around with a camera and whatever recording program he could get his hands on back in high school. “I took it more serious around 2014,” he explains. That’s when I linked with @RichmondVisionStudio and really started locking in the studio recording.\n\nTo date, he’s released one solo mixtape, <em>Frick It</em>, and a few mixtapes with the BuLife collective: <em>The Rosenhan Experiment</em>, <em>Cape Tippin</em>, and <em>The Nor’Easter Tape</em>. Most recently, they dropped last year’s <em>Beauty of the Day</em>.\n\nhttps://youtube.com/watch?v=i2cFEhrJRSU\n \nRight now though, it’s all about Silas and his solo flex. “I’m working on my EP which will be fully produced by my homie TMAC [droppin in March]. I’m also always working on different music videos, films and my debut album.”\n\nHaving independently toured the North East with BuLife, he’s looking forward to locking down a couple dates for the near future — on top of just stacking up music. “We working,” he says. “A lot of music, visuals, shows, and creative content coming in 2019. Look out for us. BuLife!”\n\nhttps://youtube.com/watch?v=7E-KeorCofg",

Her first official single “Soul Sista” produced by Shepard X is out now -- and as Imoan recounts to AAHH, the track was fun to create. \"It was made off of groove and straight vibes ... brings me back to the late 90’s early 2000’s, which was one of my fave eras of music.\n\n\"I remember Shepard X introducing the beat to me with the concept and instantly I started bopping and knew I had to have it,\" she continues.\n\nShe has always been involved in music -- and it all started with her father, who used to play his vast music collection constantly. \"From Roots Reggae to R&B soul every Sunday dinner,\" she recalls with a smile.\n\n\"I remember singing the first verse I ever wrote to my friends and they hyped me so much,\" she says. That push made me want to keep going and see what else I can do. I searched on youtube for beats and just kept writing. I felt it in my heart that this is what I’d be doing for sure.\"\n\nAll roads have led to her upcoming project, but she's not rushing anything. \"I want to take my time with this one and give people something they can relate and bump to,\" she says adding that the collaborations lined up are worth waiting for. I used to rush things because I saw other people putting stuff out ... I was just so eager to get out there. But I had to center myself and say Fuck that, take your time and don’t let others make you feel like you have to rush anything. Quality over quantity, always.\"\n\nUltimately, she's crafting a first impression that she hopes will be great. \"I’m working every day and practicing my craft to be one of the best entertainers in the industry. I plan on writing songs for other singers and artist in the industry, along with working with them on projects,\" she says, describing her long-term objectives.\n\n\"After I drop my EP, I’m going to keep creating and see where the universe lands me. I plan on doing lots of performances this year and putting myself out there. Later in my career, I plan on dabbling into acting -- another art that I’ve always enjoyed. When God gives you a talent, I believe you have to share it with the world.\"\n\nCheck out her debut single, \"Soul Sista,\" below.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pF46Hfiz0DM",

So taking the sample Joey Bada$$ originally used for Dead Prez, chopping and reworking the piano and drums to provide a whole different swing to the original song, then mixing the Vinyls verse over it,\" he explains.\n\n\"I decided on the name \"We Are Not Alone\" as a reference to his last line in the verse and the fact that in many ways he never left. His music lives on even to this day.\"\n\nThe producer tells us he has lots of dope projects coming up.

Her overcoming physical, verbal, and emotional abuse in her life and fully realizing -- and materializing -- her dreams is an inspiring story in itself.\n\nHer debut album <em>Perfect</em> is a blend of different styles and elements that have this timeless feel to them -- no confining themselves to any particular trend, and refusing to be contained, but also, managing to stay connected throughout the 18-song tracklist. So while \"2 Faced Liar\" has this big 90s tinged backtrack, \"Connect To Me\" is more of a ballad, and songs like \"Found\" and \"Ride\" have a more contemporary Hip-Hop/R&B vibe to them, it all gels into a cohesive top to bottom listening experience, with Memory's powerful voice as the glue that holds it all together.\n \nhttps://open.spotify.com/album/02P9H0cM4NijKkcts1mktn\n \nThe first single from the project, \"Don't Break Us,\" is a heartfelt plea to her partner to -- more or less -- keep the relationship intact. The extremely engaging visual depicts her slowly catching her significant other keeping what appears to be secrets, from hiding phone calls to being sketchy about mail he's receiving; it all works to illustrate the gap building between them. All of this comes together at the end as he eventually proposes at the video climax.\n\nWith a positive story of overcoming adversity and putting her faith in God -- and gives all of the glory and honor to her Lord and Savior Jesus Christ -- Memory Alexandra is a singer that deserves your attention.\n\nCheck out her video \"Don't Break Us,\" above.",

Produced entirely by CashMoney AP -- a platinum-selling beatsmith whose crafted hits for the likes of Lil Wayne, YoungBoy Never Broke Again, Ski Mask The Slump God, Tory Lanez, Dave East, Jay Critch, and MANY more -- the offering is concise but poignant.\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/BtJbL7kh0UN/\n \nIt kicks off with \"That Guy,\" which is a dollar-sign tinged profession of why he's that catch that \"she\" has been looking for -- featuring a guest verse from YFA King, who smashes the melodic flow. \"Knock Your Hustle\" is another song aimed at a female, quite cohesively playing off the thematic elements of the first track.\n\nThe special sauce though is the absolute banger \"Formula,\" in which he notes \"I think I found out the formula,\" adding that he's just warming up. His evolved Migo-esque flow with his cadence and the gorgeous flute in the bridge of the record make this song almost ironic in it's prophetic in its overall message.\n\nAt three songs, it's an appetizer at best; yet Tre Cartel appears to have hit his stride over this batch of insanely fire beats supplied by CashMoney. While we may see him open up a little more below the surface when we're blessed with a larger body of work to digest, <em>Obtain This Grain</em> has a hearty helping of replay value worth adding to your playlist if you're in search of the next-big-thing to pop from the hotbed that is Atlanta.\n\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"450\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" allow=\"autoplay\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/playlists/688264152&color=%23191919&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&show_teaser=true\"></iframe>",

Basically, it’s me reminiscing on every little thing I used to do with my significant other.”\n\nAs Kaash explains, she doesn’t plan on slowing the momentum at all, and if you’re a fan of the vibe, she’s about to get even more mellow.\n\n“I’ve gotten more into acoustics and neo-soul,” she notes, ”so keep rocking with me for the groove.”\n\nCheck out Kaash Paige’s “Love Songs,” below.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/uwIIVeGq4Xg",

    "content_html": "[dropcap]A[/dropcap]s we reported a few weeks ago, Chicago MC, ReUp Ty is dropping a nine-song LP called <em>Cagsistency</em>, produced by James Cagne — set to drop this quarter. With the haunting first single \"All I Need,\" with its gritty visual treatment still in rotation, a new video has just dropped -- teasing the next single and showing ReUp and James in the studio.\n\nWhile sipping and nodding his head to James's heavy production, we get a chance to see ReUp in his element -- in the studio. After being played an instrumental that he's obviously feeling, we're treated to the resulting single \"Nothing To Lose\" -- presented against a studio backdrop, and some cool lights.\n\nWith this super catchy track, we're even more geeked to get our hands on the full release and dig in. Check out the teaser video, above.",

    "content_html": "[dropcap]W[/dropcap]hen artists say their inspirations include names like Eminem, Biggie, Tupac, or “all the greats,” but their music doesn’t represent it at all, it simply comes off as pandering — to us anyways. It’s natural to be a fan of the greats, but we often find ourselves drawn to artists who not only like to explore a bevy of genres but timelessly seek out and draw inspiration from artists that other rappers may not. That’s one thing that drew us to Brooklyn MC Madwiz.\n\nWe’re admittedly late to the party, but his latest LP <em>718-MAD-WIZ</em> is an absolute masterpiece that we’ve been bumping since discovery, and it’s not getting old. It’s this cool eclectic patchwork of samples and vibes; we decided to reach out and learn a little more about his sound — and career trajectory.\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/Bt3fv9nnVC2/?utm_source=ig_share_sheet&igshid=13m90cfi57e9m\n\n“I’ll put it plain and simple for you: I want to be the greatest rapper that ever lived,” he tells AAHH bluntly. The self proclaimed “new sound of Brooklyn” hails the Ohio Players and his favorite band, and Prince as his favorite artist. His biggest inspiration (as far as career direction)? Marvin Gaye.\n\n“One time I got in trouble with my pops and he took away my ‘new music privileges’ and I had to start listening to hip hop from scratch,” he explained (low-key making his father sound like the coolest guy ever. “[I listened] from the beginning: Cold Crush, Egyptian Lover, Soul Sonic Force, Newcleus ... ’Jam On It’ is still my shit. I had to study until I caught up!”\n\nWith such an eclectic array of sounds molding his own, the final layer can be attributed to one of Hip Hop’s most unique figures, the ”Ultramagnetic MC” himself, Kool Keith.\n\n“One of my favorite rappers is Kool Keith. Whoever knows him recognizes he can say the most outlandish shit at times, but I’ll be damned if he ain’t telling the truth when he does,” he notes. “I took pages out of that book and added it to my style ... and boom — Madwiz.\n\n“It’s raunchy, it’s sexy, it’s poetic, it’s gangsta, it’s love.”\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/BsBHoGYFl7r/?utm_source=ig_share_sheet&igshid=i4bcr4bzm5wj\n\nHaving opened for names like Kendrick Lamar and A$AP Ferg, he has more than a few milestones under his belt, but says his biggest career moments are often the result of leveling up. “My biggest accomplishments are whenever I level up creatively... it shows in the reaction when I put shit out.”\n\nThis latest album, though, is something he considers to reside amongst his brightest accomplishments. “I evolved significantly from my last joint and the ones before it,” he says proudly. “I thought I was better than lots of these ”MCs” before, but once I saw that come together the way it did ... I don’t even doubt. I’m humble though, I’ll talk more shit when I get through the door. Job not done [*Kobe voice.*]”\n\nAs he continues the rollout for the project, telling AAHH he has videos planned for every track (we’re looking forward to a visual for “2” featuring Radamiz, btw), Madwiz hopes this music will ultimately resonate amongst the majority of listeners.\n\n“I want the world to agree on something for once ... I'm making it so that one thing is the Madwiz discography and whatever it brings,”\nhe says. “I’m just creating as I go through shit, but above all, I want what everybody else wants. Peace of mind. Let’s find that.”\n\nhttps://open.spotify.com/album/7lXH91ozYrIrwLrJIgi9rt?si=QzLDTUb6T1eE3OfpfIdrsg",

    "excerpt": null,
    "content_html": "[dropcap]H[/dropcap]aving first got onto New Orleans-born artist James Seville after he dropped his first release via streaming networks, Beta, he's been an exciting artist to watch grow. The initial taste of his sound provided a diverse base of alternative Hip Hop potential, and as he's grown, the music has only become more personal, and -- whether intentional or not -- refined. His first official release, which comes after a string of one-off singles (which we were here for), <em>Jamesville </em>is an exciting blend of vibes that perfectly encapsulate the new waves blurred lines between bar-centric traditionalism and melody-driven bops.\n\n\"I open up a lot and talk about things that have helped me grow throughout the years…losing my dad, dropping out of school, falling in love, falling out of love, drinking, drugs [etc.],” James told N.O.-based <a href=\"http://www.offbeat.com/news/james-seville/\">Off Beat Magazine</a> this past summer. “I like to make music that is genuinely good, and that people of all ages can enjoy. Rap music that you and your mom can bump together.”\n\nIt's this universality and approachability that makes this latest body of work so enjoyable. With his late father being a blues musician, and having grown up engulphed in the iconically jazzy sound of \"N'Awlins,\" James music has this unique approach. It's a melting pot of vibes, brimming with emotion -- yet acutely aware of its contemporary appeal. This can be seen by contrasting the infectious groove of \"The Kids Will Be Fine\" with the sure-shot hit-appeal of \"Send2Me\" -- which will be seeing a visual treatment this month -- and \"Margarita\" featuring Shvkiel.\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/BuetCVqlyKp/\n \nThe project kicks off with a playful vibe, with \"Career Day\" -- complete with a skit that put us in mind (spiritually) of Kanye's critically acclaimed debut, College Dropout. The tongue-n-cheek- theme of fuck school take your own path isn't religiously adhered to (at least in a straight forward sense), but does carry over in the second song, \"School Spirit,\" which features Ayomari (an artist we've had on our radar for a while now).\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/Bn_mRWcAatI/\n \n<blockquote>“I am inspired by a lot of older New Orleans musicians,\" he told DNO magazine in an interview. \"My mom always took me out of school and brought me to Jazz Fest ever since I can remember ... I met Allen Toussaint when I was nine-years-old.\"</blockquote>\n\nThis impending sense of making his dreams a priority is felt on the album, as is this gloss of smokey grooves that make it immediately likable. With James recently revealing that he is becoming a father this August, there is feeling that things go in full-circle. <em>Jamesville </em>is an encapsulation of his road up to this point; an excellent opportunity to orient yourself for what he has coming next. \"I haven’t stopped smiling since <em>Jamesville </em>came out,\" James admitted via Instagram. \"I hope y’all are enjoying it.\"\n\nhttps://open.spotify.com/album/5pYOnznogoU8MFZHQrHZyu?si=WyrSCkuPTvKle7d50uNLww",

He relocated to the Central Pacific island in 2017 and beginning building the creative hub after the loss of his daughter\n\n\"You was hoping that I'd stop and fumble, what ... because I'm middle-aged dope and don't f*cking mumble?\" -- Mr2theP, \"SANDCASTLES\"\n\nThe visual for the super cool single was shot via iPhone X with anamorphic lens and edited by P himself, is -- according to him -- beyond a display of his creativity, a taste of what's to come. \"I recently took up video directing, and I'm looking to expand on my visuals this year, crafting videos to some of the significant features I'm sitting on,\" he says.\n\nHe's mum about the features themselves, preferring to show and prove, allowing the product to speak for itself; however, based on his track record, which includes a discography packed with quality releases (and collaborations with Daylyt among others), we're in for something special.\n\nCheck out the video, above.",

    "content_html": "<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Mark Spratley is a name in the industry you certainly should get acquainted with. A master of many, creating an entity in so many different lanes within the industry from management, PR, writing, events, curation and much more. Within five years of the industry, Sprat has accomplished what takes many 20-30 years. The young 27-year-old mogul is creating an empire before our eyes, and it only seems to be getting more and more impressive. Why wouldn't it?! From helping to bring artists such as Lud Foe, DDG, DaBaby, Smooky Margielaa, Albee Al, Sicko Mobb, Nikko Lafre and many more to the limelight, his resume is vast.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Take a look at our most recent interview with the Starting Five CEO as we discuss music, how to get in the industry, his journey and much more.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>Make sure to follow Sprat on <a href=\"http://www.twitter.com/spratfool\" rel=\"noopener\">Twitter</a> and <a href=\"http://www.instagram/com/spratfool\">IG</a> @SpratFool</strong></p>\n<strong>You've been in the music industry for only five years and have already created something massive. How did you do it and what is planned for the future?</strong>\n\nCountless hours, grind, plotting and studying. I've learned, and LVL'd UP. That's it. I knew if I put in the work, I would find a way. I go 3000% for whatever I do or whoever I work with. Some people make the same moves and expect things to change. Some people aren't willing to starve to binge forever. I'm out here mastering and succeeding at whatever I do. I make sure of it. I've got an insane ear for music, that's been known. That's why some of your favorite A&R's would be asking me to pull up to their office on the regular.\n\nI'm here to take over though. I'm going to continue to put people into position and maintain my brand. The empire is forming; the foundation has been laid and built.\n\n<strong>We recently saw in another interview that you have a new platform on the way? What're the details on that? (If you can give us any)</strong>\n\nNEW DAY, NEW WAVE (LITERALLY). Zias (Popular youtube star &influencer) and I are partnering up on a new media outlet x platform for something special. We're about to surpass the field quick. Two powerful influencers, we already got the traffic between both of us, both widely connected. Run it up!\n\nBunch of content on the way from both of us\n\n<strong>If you could tell someone looking to get into the industry one piece of advice, what would it be?</strong>\n\nGRIND SMART. Bring something to the table. Your passion and time can go a long way. Learn. Be willing to do what the next man is not.\n\nDo you know how much free time and work I gave out to get to where I am now?! Now my time costs. Money isn't everything, in the beginning, work for your opportunity. People worried about $20-$5000 (Short term money) when sometimes you just need to see the bigger picture.\n\nYou wouldn't want everyone to bring ketchup to the BBQ; you need someone to bring the bun, the burger, the juice, the drink and everything else. Do you feel me?! Same goes for the industry or any job you do in life. Bring something different to the table and create a demand for it. That's when you create stock for yourself (You create worth).\n\n<strong>What were you doing before becoming a music mogul?</strong>\n\nI was doing the school thing before I decided to leave for music full time. I was making money however I needed to.\n\n<strong>What new artists do you have your eye on?</strong>\n\nNEW SIGNINGS on the way. I'm getting back in my artist bag 3000%. Look out for all of that. I got to hold my list down for the time being.\n\n<strong>How did you get into PR?</strong>\n\nFresh Moss and Neako had me on a lot of PR type of moves early. I always studied and noticed was going on in the game. Got tired of hitting up a lot of these foolish and corny \"Bloggers\" and people that were out and around at the time that felt entitled. A lot of them aren't even around anymore haha. Many didn't want to see someone else moving faster or making something out of all this. I decided to take everything into my own hands. From then on I turned this PR wave into something masterful. Countless artists have popped off since through my PR, their ability and me connecting these dots on the daily.\n\n<strong>Top 5 modern artists most likely in your daily music mix?</strong>\n\nIt all depends on the day and mood\n\nLately... DaBaby, pre kai ro, Lil Baby, YNW Melly, Stunna 4 Vegas & DaiDough. I've been bumping FBG Duck heavily as of late; bro got energy.\n\n<strong>A few artists are rising out of New Jersey that you've been alerting us about for over a year or 2. From Daidough to Coi Leray and many more. New Jersey has some talent for sure, how do you think your state will hold up in 2019?</strong>\n\nNew Jersey is UP right now, and it's only going to get crazier. A lot of artists doing their thing. Daidough got home and been going stupid. Coi Leray has been spazzing since G.A.N.\n\nAlbee Al doing him as always, Tsu Surf home and just dropped a fire project, Arsonal on damn TV, Fatboy SSE is outta here and in his lane, Mir Fontane been putting in work. Jersey got a wide variety of sounds, every city/town is different, North and South Jersey completely different.\n\nBeyond the artists, there are so many talented people coming up out of NJ and doing their thing in this music industry or elsewhere. It's great to see people winning from your home state.\n\n<strong>We remember you going crazy at SXSW with Smooky Margielaa a few years back when he was only an artist with a 10k following, how did you all meet?</strong>\n\nShit, my man Mike had told me I had to bump something while we were in LA. The track happened to be 'Layed up,' heard it and it was a wrap for me. His mans was GRAPE, we were all in LA, so we all linked up at the apartment, vibed and got to work immediately. Started putting in that push, went to SXSW and went full force after SXSW. Glad to see Smooky up right now.\n\n<strong>We dove into your Twitter and did a little google search on you while doing some more research. We saw you got into it a little with Akademiks online last year? LOL, tell us more?</strong>\n\nLMAO! If you did some research like you said I'm sure you know what was said. Jersey people certainly don't tolerate bullshit. I called BS on something he spoke on. Jersey got behind it. That's it.\n\n<strong>What ever happened to Nikko Lafre? </strong>\n\nMan, I can't speak on another man that's not with me. We had something crazy growing, that's where I'm going to leave it.\n\nDrew Love out here winning though with THEY, Lee Beats out here winning, Johnny Rain out here still doing his thing up.\n\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-25719 size-medium\" src=\"http://aboveaveragehiphop.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/cap-1-x-sprat-300x400.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"400\" />\n\n<strong>Thoughts on R Kelly latest situation and documentary? </strong>\n\nSHEESH! I don't want to believe it, but it's their right before our eyes. It's a shame because his music and voice are legendary. I feel as though 60 Minutes would have been a more credible platform to present this problem to the world instead of a Lifetime documentary. I'd like to hear R Kelly voice his defense for sure, but regardless his actions are sickening. We'll see how it taints his legacy, it is 2019 so who knows.\n\n<strong>2019 plans?</strong>\n\nREGULATE\n\n<img class=\"size-medium wp-image-25709 alignright\" src=\"http://aboveaveragehiphop.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/viceland-x-starting-five-300x375.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"375\" /> <img class=\"size-medium wp-image-25710 alignleft\" src=\"http://aboveaveragehiphop.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Dj-Khaled-x-Sprat-300x300.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"300\" />",

    "content_html": "[dropcap]P[/dropcap]rovincetown, Massachusetts, MC Silas Luster released a brand new EP <em>W.A.V.</em> on March 29th that I've meant to share my thoughts on, but to be honest, it was a dense listen. Not in an unapproachable way, mind you. Instead, it's like an onion made of many, discussion worthy layers, painted atop lush soundscapes that are (at points) reminiscent of OG EL-P production from the early Def Juxx days.\n\n<a href=\"http://aboveaveragehiphop.com/indiespotlight-getting-to-know-provincetown-artist-silas-luster/\"><h3>RELEVANT: Getting To Know Provincetown Artist Silas Luster</h3></a>\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx7q3oOUAUg\n \nThe EP kicks off with \"Sion,\" which starts with his wordy flow over a head-nodding instrumental that switches up halfway through, into this bongo drum pattern over which he drops the strongest verse easily on the project; I'd love to see it live. \"Diewittit\" is another song that I found myself revisiting over and over. His cadence and rhyme schemes at times have this loose appeal that reminds me of the Freestyle Fellowship-esque aura that dominated college radio in the 90s.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EIKw3Oi7H3I\n \nHe speaks a lot about his journey, and also a lot of spiritual topics -- from the universe to putting meditation over medicine. It's a lot to unpack, in a good way. You can hear the spoken word elements that seem to be the backbone of his bars -- check the acapella interlude \"What's Love?\" as a great example of what I mean.\n\nThe almost haunting chorus on \"O.S.H.N\" wasn't necessarily jarring but did set the song apart as a black sheep of the EP. Not that it's a bad song -- it's one of the strongest tracks -- but, it's just a different vibe that stuck out to me.\n\nOverall, I dig this EP a lot. If you find yourself a little inundated with the sea of Lil rappers, and the endless sea of meh that often dominates the mainstream consciousness, Silas offers up a slice of subversive Hip Hop. It's music crafted to both cathartically get things off of his chest and also get your thinking -- depending on your aptitude on some of his topics, maybe even get you googling and reading shit.\n\nHe is currently touring throughout New England and the Tri-State. Check the schedule.\n\n<iframe style=\"width: 100%; max-width: 660px; overflow: hidden; background: transparent;\" src=\"https://embed.music.apple.com/us/album/w-a-v/1458083136\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" sandbox=\"allow-forms allow-popups allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-storage-access-by-user-activation allow-top-navigation-by-user-activation\"></iframe>",

After citizens were forced into crime and stringent gang affiliation as a survival tactic, leading to historically high crime rates (98%), Nightmare Force ran by the Leader CRINGEWORTHY (Kaiju) formed to aid citizens and patrol areas from bandits and mobs.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The incredibly intricate storyline and visual experience is something we’ve come to expect from Kaiju; the some itself is an absolute earworm. This guy is a crazy good lyricist, which makes his music even more fun as it stands alone, even without the visual accompaniment.</p>\nIt’s welcomed entry into the series — sitting amongst the top two, easily. Check out the video, above.",

That's the case for AAHH mainstay Major D-Star; after releasing his long-awaited <i>Trap</i> <i>Star</i>  mixtape back in February, he is dropping off \"Stack Pray & Stay Out The Way,\" a song I personally described as an illustration of his immense focus on his \"current hustle of choice, music.\"\n<h4><a href=\"http://aboveaveragehiphop.com/major-d-star-drops-trap-star-mixtape/\"><strong>RECENT: Major D-Star Drops “Trap Star” Mixtape</strong></a></h4>\nThe video, like his others, delivers on quality. Directed by Wally Woo, with a multitude of scenery interspersed around a loose storyline of himself working as a mechanic -- which he playfully describes as his way of \"stacking and staying out the way\" in the into -- it gives ample life to one of his project's most infectious earworms.

    "excerpt": null,
    "content_html": "[dropcap]W[/dropcap]ith a sole mission to spread the Holy Spirit, South Sacramento native Tru Judah is a different kind of religiously inclined artist. Prominently, as an Israelite, which many will remember as being a group referenced on Kendrick Lamar’s “Yah” — a group strongly shrouded in misconceptions — this record, I’m Free, is full of powerful imagery, motivational gems, and insight into the personal journey of a man whose faith has taken him to a state of tranquillity amid the realities of today’s mentally taxing norms.\n\n“I used the love the money, now I love Christ,” he laments — a sentiment that perfectly encapsulates the underlying theme of this project. The LP off the rip has an almost jarring amount of sonic diversity. From in your face trappish soundbeds, to lush funky vibes, it’s a musical journey that manages to escape any sense of baseline, never quite letting you leave your guard down; in the best way possible.\n\nOff the rip of “King Son,” he firmly plants his faith like a flag into the peak of a mountain, almost aggressively challenging the faith of others; with cursing and an immediately recognizable sense of street appeal in his pen game, it becomes clear that this isn’t your average religiously inclined affair — a point Tru himself makes clear.\n\n“This ain’t no church y’all, fuck your preacher I’m just throwing out gems and I hope they reach you,” he raps. For those who stick with it, it becomes clear the loving (almost OG level) of life lessons he’s dropping.\n\nThere are some definite standouts we found ourselves going back to more than a few times.\n\n“The World Don’t Love Us,” which details the dire realities of a cousin’s life in prison amid the backdrop of the general socio-economic climate brown and black Americans, as well as “Comply Or Die,” which is a stern call to stop walking as opposed to marching against the violence and oppression that African Americans experience at the hands of authoritative bodies inject a sense of social intelligence into the tracklist.\n\n“Dear Old Me” is a super soulful record — with a sexy horn and a dope scratch sample — that sees him taking a hindsight look at the demons of his past. Demons that told him he should kill himself (among other things). The track really illuminated the enduring spirit of the ‘new him’ who overcame his environment (the violent South Sacramento of the 90s). It also touches on some of the same elements as the equally shiny “I’m Free,” where he hammers in the freedom he’s achieved from the materialistic false narrative lens through which many live lives that do little to properly benefit themselves and their communities.\n\nA record of this magnitude is quite ambitious and has the potential to turn some people off, which is a shame. Kanye once rapped “If this takes away from my spins, which will probably take away from my end, then I hope it takes away from my sins,” on the record “Jesus Walks.” A top to bottom listen quickly reveals he’s not here for the same commercial gain you’re likely to find elsewhere. Whether or not he succeeds in waking you up to the true 12 tribes of Israel, it’s impossible not to find a few motivational tidbits worth applying to your own outlook on things.\n\nPress play.\n\nhttps://open.spotify.com/album/7MguwQEqTBeNDZHy7o8cR3?si=mVD1NUi2RXi2Y0ZsLMWobA",

    "content_html": "<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">[dropcap]I[/dropcap]’ve been quite vocal in the past about the importance of album sequencing — especially when it comes to the narrative arc of a project’s storyline (no matter How loose). This is something that came into play when I was checking out this fascinating gem from Gladstone, Michigan, MC Chughey. Lost In My Mind is unique in that out of context, some of the project’s lighter fare, such as the age-old money chase of ”Casino, ” create a fresh, grind-savvy impression of Chughey. However, a top to bottom listen to his LP is, to say the least, a journey through the mind of a man dealing with more than he’s able to handle himself.</span></p>\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-CPc95KXQg\n \n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Starting off as a testament to the hustle he’s diligently dedicated himself to, “Maneuver” and “Nothing New” absolutely sparkle. Self-produced, the project has pretty tight production, and Chughey’s cadence really pulls things together nicely.\n\nIt’s when we hit “Feels Right” that things start to take a turn for the dark. What plays out as a complicated relationship that he’s unable to have fully reciprocated — despite deep emotional investment — plays into the next track “Deepest,” which sees him seemingly professing the stranglehold that love has over him, and how his aforementioned emotional investment simultaneously makes his object of affection a remedy and a weapon. “Off Of You,” is an uncomfortable confession that his demons destroyed the relationship he was in, and he is now struggling to exist without her engulfing his thoughts.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">What stands out is “Fine,” which is a quintessential theme song for checking in on your friends. The song is a heart-wrenching confession that though he — though his exterior is hardened — is experiencing a crisis on the inside. We also learn as this portion of the tracklist progresses that he was numbing much of his emotions with alcohol; he later finds his way, and songs like the sunny “Wasted Days” feels like sunshine cutting through the haze that we’ve been taken through.</span></p>\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwN34fbDfsM\n \n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">What happens when the plans change, and we get into a dark place? Many people go through it, and for Chughey, sharing his experience — whether or not it’s genuinely autobiographical — is brave and necessary in a landscape where mental health has proven to be one our generation’s greatest threats. While it definitely escalated quickly and probably isn’t a casual listen as a whole, it’s a worthwhile slice of honest, self-produced artwork.</span></p>",

    "content_html": "[dropcap]T[/dropcap]he summer season is in full swing, and Washington DC’s Treezus — part of the international arts collective Yellow Cloud — has been making some season buzz with his pack of recent singles, “IB2” and “Brainfood, both of which have received dope (AnxiouStoner filmed) visual treatments.\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/BwfyqtEhFRF/?igshid=12ljyf5t2nr6a\n\nThe Birdie Bands produced “IB2” has an insanely eclectic vibe; Treezus’ wildly unique cadence, with peppered pockets of rapid-fire delivery, body the beat. The visual, which was shot throughout Italy (Venice, Naples, a farm in Tuscany and Florence) offers breathtaking scenery, with a dizzying pace that rarely lets you break the engagement. The Hidden Oasis banger “Brain Food,” a smoking anthem (originally released on 4/20) was appropriately shot in Amsterdam. This record gives this strange Bone Thugs vibe as he goes in with his machine gun flow during the latter half of the verse. It’s actually captivating.\n<h4>Relevant: <a href=\"http://aboveaveragehiphop.com/work-fi-mi-an-interview-with-yellow-cloud/\">Work Fi Mi: An Interview With Yellow Cloud</a></h4>\nThe visuals were directed and edited by Treezus himself; and both really take the songs to new heights, in my humble opinion. The music we’ve featured in the past definitely range in terms of the aesthetic, but real talk, Treezus is more than in his element — and the international story arc he’s on is making his brand sparkle.\n\nCheck out “IB2” and “Brain Food” below.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/1kK1CX9_Iiw\n\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/p3TJIcBaMuQ\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>",

    "content_html": "[dropcap]D[/dropcap]-Brown and 30 Boy Will — two artists on my radar — have absolutely found a way to make an overcrowded lane feel like an empty highway. Their latest collaborative effort <em>Full Court Pressure</em> landed across my desk this week, and I’ve been cranking it ever since.\n\nThe vibe is very familiar sonically. Hard beats that remain extremely cohesive, keeping the project fairly levelled — making for a skip-free top to bottom experience, without having to readjust yourself. The sub category the duo fall into often have a tendency to keep the thematic elements of their projects quite predictable. While these two do pick the low hanging fruit at a few points (for lack of a better analogy) there is this undeniable rawness in their bars ... an almost explosion of authenticity that trumps much of the fabricated storytelling new jacks have made trendy.\n\nIt’s an aura reminiscent of Jeezy in his heyday.\n\nAt a solid seven songs (with very little fat to trim) the project is an easy listen — but offers a hearty meal for those craving some substance to go along with their playlist-ready bassy beats.\n\nThere are plenty of gems here. The aptly titled “Official” was one that I immediately found myself running back a few times — as I did with the look-at-me-now vibe of “Bag Today.” The obligatory but tastefully flipped song about the females, “Preferences,” sees the two professing their taste for women with money and things of their own (among other assets).\n\nOne of the shiniest moments on the project is the infectious “Memphis,” which sports a chorus from the LP’s sole feature — the older brother of Juicy J and the co-founder of Three 6 Mafia, Project Pat — helping segue the two incredible verses by D and 30.\n\nThe track has been my most played this week (it wasn’t even close).\n\nTheir chemistry is undeniable and their ear for the perfect production to complement their tales of perseverance, street life and subdued (but still prominent) themes of opulence are on full display. While the two can really rap, it doesn’t feel like past tense, but rather present tense play by plays.\n\n“Money doesn’t make you real,” D laments in the intro of “Official.” It’s this mantra of keeping it 100 and letting it speak for itself that drives <i>Full Court Pressure</i>. Cue it up, press play and enjoy.\n\nhttps://open.spotify.com/album/1QkfWvlk2NtweYmD869yDB?si=CRlTZRm8Qv-82vFCbQNJkg",

    "content_html": "[dropcap]T[/dropcap]oday's game is truly a never-ending cycle of here today and gone tomorrow. For<a href=\"http://aboveaveragehiphop.com/?s=track+seven\"> Track Seven Band,</a> haven't released a project since 2016's The Try And The Fail, the uphill battle it seems is reigniting the flame within casual fans who may have moved on to the next one. It's this overarching idea that guides Cost's pen for their brand new single \"Memory Loss.\"\n<h4><a href=\"http://aboveaveragehiphop.com/indiespotlight-track-seven-band-the-try-and-the-fail/\">RELATED: #IndieSpotlight: Track Seven Band – The Try And The Fail</a></h4>\nThere is a lot to unpack with this single. Top-level, there is this flagrant (metaphorical) slap across the head -- as though he's screaming, \"I'm still here, stupid.\" Below the surface, Cost takes the opportunity to reiterate his position, introduces rumor inducing storylines, and takes a look back at his past.\n\nIn the first verse, he drops mention of having traveled around the world on the dime of a figure whom he chooses to keep anonymous; as he explains, this person gave him the motivation he needed to jumpstart his career, but has since \"turned faces.\" It's in this act -- he further notes that haters induce the same phenomenon -- that he seems to have found the strength to thrive.\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/B3r4GnVpe79/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link\n\nThe second verse begins by reiterating where he's come from -- noting that section 8 and financial aid were his life preservers in his darkest moments. He also notes that he's still in debt (half of which he paid off with the money he made selling weed). All this isn't done to glorify anything, but rather serve as motivation. It also hammers home the fact that he has been there and done that, too.\n\nPerhaps in a way, he's exuding the same motivation that he felt traveling the world.\n\nPlaying chess as opposed to checkers is a line that poignantly pops out. \"Memory Loss\" is a strong (re)introduction or merely business as usual -- depending on your knowledge of the band. Either way, it's drenched in that endearing sense of honesty and realness that made them a group I've returned to numerous times since first being introduced to their music.\n\nIt's all about the long game, and -- in the end -- good music. Cost notes that he's motivated by things that money can't buy. That, quite often, is code for having something to lose on a deeper level. It's in seeing an artist stick to their figurative guns without bending their ethics that true inspiration can be felt.\n\nIf you haven't explored the past releases, do so ... immediately.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/c1VovHzbQ9A",

Skillz was well known as a ghostwriter in the industry, crafting countless hits — dominating Billboard in his prime. However, he found himself having a considerable amount of headaches attempting to collect funds for the (life-changing) services he rendered to artists (who were mainly superstars). </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I have always thought being a ghostwriter must be an odd experience. Imagine having to hear chart-topping singles everywhere you go and accept that nobody but you is aware of your involvement. But, I imagine watching artists live their best lives while singing your songs and not paying for it would be infuriating. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>This was the case for Skillz, who decided to put the artists in his accounts receivable list on blast. \"Ghostwriter\" is a firsthand account of how he effortlessly crafted hits for artists who have yet to pay up — bleeping their names. The best part was, the third verse threatened to drop an uncensored version if he didn't get his money.  </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>Can you even imagine if this happened today? </strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The use of ghostwriters is something that will follow Drake for the rest of his career.

    "content_html": "<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Anyone who followed my writing over the years knows that — aside from being especially drawn to eclectic groups — I am a sucker for a great story. This week, I found both of those things after being put on to a new release titled <em>WORD</em> from Hyattsville-based band The Mighty Heard. Yet, it isn't new at all. In fact, it's close to a decade old.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:core-embed/youtube {\"url\":\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRIvgdyLIYE\",\"type\":\"video\",\"providerNameSlug\":\"youtube\",\"className\":\"wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"} -->\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRIvgdyLIYE\n</div></figure>\n<!-- /wp:core-embed/youtube -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>They recorded the material back in 2010 while gaining traction as they became staples on the Washington, DC live music scene. However, as it often does, life took the individual members on different paths just two years later. Sadly, group member Dullah D suffered a stroke and ultimately succumbed to brain failure in 2017 — a tragedy that reunited them. Notably, the event sparked a need to release the group's sole body of work into the world as a salute to their fallen brothers (they also lost percussionist Gerard Bingham).</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:quote -->\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>“We lost a couple of friends along the way, God bless 'em all we'll love 'em to this day.”</p><cite>The Mighty Heard</cite></blockquote>\n<!-- /wp:quote -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>People often use the word timeless liberally, but this LP appears to have mimicked the properties of the finest wine you can imagine. Though the sense of loss and ultimate finality weighed on my mind and heart going into <em>WORD</em>, the project doesn't allow you dwell as it grabs you by the collar and proceeds to deliver a fantastic set of music that I would kill to experience live.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>If you're a fan of live music groups, like say, The Roots, this is up your alley — though don't expect anything nearly as jazzy and clearcut in terms of its Hip Hop aesthetic (and nothing as intense as Black Thought's rhyme schemes). Not to say that this isn't just as poignant in terms of content, but it's different in a good way. There are Dullah's distinct bars, and there's Terry T's soulful voice, and then there is the band's lovingly crafted brand of unabashed funk that envelopes and feeds off the two; it's a complex dynamic that makes the music so inexplicably warm.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:core-embed/youtube {\"url\":\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-H05W-GcNJ4\",\"type\":\"video\",\"providerNameSlug\":\"youtube\",\"className\":\"wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"} -->\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-H05W-GcNJ4\n</div></figure>\n<!-- /wp:core-embed/youtube -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I was pleasantly surprised at the project's depth as well. While \"Butt that Funk\" sets the tone early on, it finds itself getting reflective, socially conscious, and even sexy as it moves along. \"How Many Kids\" reworks Extra P's bars from the Main Source hit \"Looking At The Front Door\" into a song about abusive and absentee fathers — and the influence it can have on children and the paths they later take.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>\"Bad Things\" was another moment I found myself running back over and over. It takes a rather dark tone juxtaposed with the rest of the project, but I found it contains some of the LP's shiniest raps.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>My fav song here ended up being the love song, \"Deep.\" I generally operate on emotions when it comes to music that lasts the test of time within my rotations. In particular, that song became a soundtrack for a late-night drive I took before penning this article.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>This project gave me the same feeling of satisfying discovery as when I go record digging for obscure records — despite being contemporary. It's a time capsule of sorts that manages to be so fresh and immediate that hearing its actual age is almost jarring. Though it was loss and sadness that pushed the group to give that period of their lives the sense of full-circle closure it deserves, its energy makes it the perfect tangible tribute that they and all those who hold the group's memory can hold on to forever.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Sadly, I missed the boat on the vinyl pre-order. This type of project would be in great company in my crates, but digital is a great consolation experience and a CD version on <a href=\"https://growroom.bandcamp.com/album/word\">their Bandcamp </a>for those interested.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The Mighty Heard's <em>WORD</em> is available now via Growroom Productions.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:html -->\n<iframe style=\"border: 0; width: 100%; height: 786px;\" src=\"https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=3157078488/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/transparent=true/\" seamless=\"\"><a href=\"https://growroom.bandcamp.com/album/word\">WORD by The Mighty Heard</a></iframe>\n<!-- /wp:html -->",

This is the message emanating from the new single \"Release The Transcripts\" by musician, ordained bishop, entrepreneur, and social activist Darrell Kelley. A prominent muse for the song's emotionally charged rallying cry is <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://thehill.com/person/breonna-taylor\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Breonna Taylor</a>, a 26-year-old Black woman shot and killed by police in her Louisville home this past March.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The call for the release of the transcripts stems from the controversial motion that was filed by Atty. Gen. Daniel Cameron to delay the release of transcripts and audio from the grand jury's inquiry into the killing; though such a release is generally unusual, a separate motion filed by an unidentified juror argued that there was a \"compelling public interest\" to have the grand jury record released. It also accused Cameron of \"using the grand jury to deflect accountability and responsibility for [the indictment] decisions.\"</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>A judge granted the delay so that Cameron's offices could redact personal information of people who were part of the proceedings. Audio of the proceedings (which totals over 20 hours) was finally released on October 2, 2020 — although an actual transcription has yet to surface. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Still, as Darrell Kelley makes quite clear, justice was far from served in this case — with two officers walking and one facing charges for the shots that didn't hit <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://thehill.com/person/breonna-taylor\">Breonna</a>.

Aptly titled <em>The Healing</em>, his new 16-song LP is haunting, poignant, powerful, and insightful. More than a call to action, though, it's a portrait of how faith, regardless if it's one that runs counter to your own, can shape change and ultimately free your perspective to a place of much-needed tranquility.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:html -->\n<blockquote class=\"instagram-media\" data-instgrm-captioned data-instgrm-permalink=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/CFF-epfnEzV/?utm_source=ig_embed&utm_campaign=loading\" data-instgrm-version=\"13\" style=\" background:#FFF;

It begins with relaxing nature sounds before slowly transitioning into a police shooting of an unarmed citizen then immediately into a protest. It then transitions into the child's birth before coming full circle back to the sounds from the beginning.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>It's an emotionally stirring six-minute experience.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>In a way, the intro's arc loosely resembles the LP flow, exceptionally if you choose to accept the child's birth as a potential allegory for his reawakening (Judah identifies as an Israelite). Much like his previous release, <em>I'm Free,</em> he manages to revel in his journey without necessarily prescribing — though there are moments that felt darker on this LP, rawer. \"Dirty Secrets\" is a great example, pulling the wool off of white America's habit of complacency for real-world happening that falls outside of their own lives. Then there is this </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>There are a lot of layers to this project, not unlike an onion. There are glimpses into his journey and the past he left behind when he changed his life and accepted the divine power of a high purpose. But, I found myself most drawn to the moments of motivation and strength, especially given the week we've all had to go through.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>There are some incredibly useful anecdotes I walked away with from the collection of songs. For example, this one story on the neo-soul-tinged \"The Window.\" In it, he details an exchange with a bird. He's momentarily emotional considering how he'd love to fly away like the birds before it tells him he'll never be free if he doesn't spread his wings and merely try. I ran it back a few times.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>\"Persevere\" also feels like such a relatable storyline of overcoming and holding on to whatever hope one deems necessary — amid depression and crushing isolation. Amongst the lows, though, are incredibly high with songs like \"I'm Free,\" which sees him exude his passion for his spirituality over a fun, soulful soundscape. \"Friends\" is a letter of utmost love and appreciation for the friends he counts as blessings in his life, and the outro, \"A Toast To Success,\" feels like a celebration.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Spiritually infused Hip Hop isn't always this approachable; Tru Judah walks a comfortable tight rope of personal affirmations, OG level straight-talk, and sociopolitically aware pen game. Sonically, it's consistent as hell. Judah's distinct cadence and eclectic lyrical content give <em>The Healing</em> a lot of life — and in today's world, its underlying messages are something that could all use.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->",

To put that in context with Griselda's timeline, Westside Gunn crafted his debut mixtape <em>Flyest Nig@@ in Charge, Vol. 1</em> in 2005 — and Conway hadn't been shot yet (that happened in late 2006).</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The two had a shared connection, the late DJ Shay.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>\"God bless DJ Shay … I recorded my first mixtapes in [Shay's] studio.

    "content_html": "<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Lyric Jones has been buzzing for years, though I'll admit I became a huge fan of hers last year after sitting with her <em><a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/album/4tR8jQ9Vn9NfsOISYDOZOb?si=KI_9AIU9TFCxl3LHROss6w\">Ga$ Mo</a>ney </em>LP with producer Nameless for an extended period — before taking a more focused deep dive into her back catalog. There is something so approachable and yet remarkably complex about her style, in my opinion. It has a comforting aesthetic of chicken soup for the soul.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>As I generally do when I fall in love with an artist’s body of work, I connected with her on social media and made it clear that I’d love to chat with her (something she was down for). Though life did its thing, and my 2019 took some strange turns, leaving that conversation in the shuffle. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>2020 has been a remarkably hard year for everyone; especially so for creatives who thrive off of experience. In this climate, Lyric managed to adapt  and craft the most dynamic body of work in her catalog, <em><a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/album/3ecFMBYpXW2H02GeD36FOV\">Closer Than They Appear</a></em>, which dropped in late October. A new press run meant a renewed opportunity to connect with the Boston MC and — despite some connection issues (on-brand with 2020, tbh) — she earnestly shared her process of creating this LP, working with Phonte and her bigger picture after close to a decade of releasing music.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>\"It was hard to find inspiration, outside of [police brutality] news porn and social media pointing out negatives,\" Lyric tells me of her new LP. \"It was challenging to lean on other perspectives and making sure it wasn’t a downer album ... to find other things to pull from because I’m a very active person. I’m typically on the move. This was different.\"</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:core-embed/youtube {\"url\":\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAqo4ttulXY\",\"type\":\"video\",\"providerNameSlug\":\"youtube\",\"className\":\"wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"} -->\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAqo4ttulXY\n</div></figure>\n<!-- /wp:core-embed/youtube -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>As Lyric explains, she began the process of the album’s creation in February, just before the world turned upside down at the hands of a global pandemic that brought things to a standstill. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>\"The beginning of COVID-19 was the beginning of the album,\" she says. \"So, it’s like it grew with the development of what was going on in the world.\"</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>When contrasted with her past releases, the most significant difference between this project is that it was executively produced by the highly esteemed wordsmith Phonte, who rose to Hip Hop prominence as part of the North Carolina outfit Little Brother (alongside Big Pooh and producer 9th Wonder).</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Though, the process wasn’t exactly what the two had initially envisioned due to the lockdown.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>\"Ideally, I think Phonte and I wanted to work in person ...  it ended up working better for both of us to demo each other’s ideas anyways,\" she says. \"There's pros and cons to being up in each other's creative process.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>\"My preference would have been to cook up with him [in person] versus engineering myself and doing everything in my four walls here at home.\"</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:html -->\n<blockquote class=\"instagram-media\" data-instgrm-captioned=\"\" data-instgrm-permalink=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/CG23mBMjB7V/?utm_source=ig_embed&utm_campaign=loading\" data-instgrm-version=\"13\" style=\" background:#FFF;

He dropped a few highly recommended collaborative LPs: <em><a href=\"https://big-o.bandcamp.com/album/ocean-grown\">Ocean Grown</a></em> with Loki Loko and a deluxe version of <em><a href=\"https://big-o.bandcamp.com/album/a-new-day-deluxe-version\">A New Day</a></em> with Dankery Harv. That on top of a handful of and a pretty knocking instrumental EP, <em><a href=\"https://big-o.bandcamp.com/album/parking-violations-ep-instrumentals\">Parking Violations</a></em>. However, the best still may be yet to come, as a brand new single titled “The Preordained” with South Side Jamaica Queens MC L.O.U. signals a sophomore effort heads may want to keep an eye out for; let me explain.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:core-embed/youtube {\"url\":\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JjEngZrnBjI\",\"type\":\"video\",\"providerNameSlug\":\"youtube\",\"className\":\"wp-embed-aspect-4-3 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"} -->\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-4-3 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JjEngZrnBjI\n</div></figure>\n<!-- /wp:core-embed/youtube -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>L.O.U. and Big O first connecting about three years ago on this gem of a project titled <em><a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/album/6TiT3JMcPfWBIJg3ybKc7E\">The South Side Of Things</a></em>. Anyone who knows me knows my affinity for Brooklyn luminary Skyzoo, who appears on the track “Who Would’ve Thought,” off the said project. That was a gateway into L.O.U., and a thorough top to bottom at the time showed gobs of promise, with the Queens wordsmith penning an incredibly thoughtful body of work — traversing everything from his upbringing to his rocky relationship with his parents. It was relatable, and I saw him catch a stride.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:core-embed/youtube {\"url\":\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SR4IaE5lpgo\",\"type\":\"video\",\"providerNameSlug\":\"youtube\",\"className\":\"wp-embed-aspect-4-3 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"} -->\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-4-3 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SR4IaE5lpgo\n</div></figure>\n<!-- /wp:core-embed/youtube -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The project was a sleeper — a status only bolstered by what seemed like radio silence since 2018. But this new track, “The Preordained,” is impressive. I made it the soundtrack of a night run around my city and found myself lost in its compelling vibe.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>It follows a similar structural path of some of the more intriguing tracks off his past work, going off with no hook over Big O’s moody production that gives off these cinematic feels. It’s decidedly darker in tone, at points more aggressive, as he describes premonitions of death and skating through the grimy side of things.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Still, he’s maintaining a confident demeanor; there is one bar where he describes his 2020 flow as being like water — which is a great way to describe it. He and Big O feel like Peanut Butter and Jelly, and this direction harkens to a sound that is shying away from the more mainstream aesthetic currently coming out of New York. It finds itself more so riding the underground wave presently making its way through the current landscape.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>With an inevitable sophomore from the two on the horizon, his absence begs many questions, and this new single seems to signify that he was living life in the downtime; his style has become even more fluid, and this particular soundscape fits him like a glove.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Big O makes excellent music, and not only does this song seem to signify an LP full of quotables and back button mashers on L.O.U.’s part, but also a sign that O isn’t here to play around.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Catch up; stream Big O and L.O.U.’s “The Preordained” below.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:core-embed/youtube {\"url\":\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MYaB4bd940\",\"type\":\"video\",\"providerNameSlug\":\"youtube\",\"className\":\"wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"} -->\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MYaB4bd940\n</div></figure>\n<!-- /wp:core-embed/youtube -->",

One of my fav songs was the lovingly somber \"<a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/track/1Z2fTShleFT0MajvKGlElo?si=FYxx4woWTKm-iv1EX7MQBw\">Morning Coffee</a>,\" with its oddly calming chorus threading together verses laden with some serious and relatable shower thoughts.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>However, his latest release has quickly become my fav cut in his catalog, \"Diggin' (A Crate Digger's Anthem).\" As the name suggests, it's an ode to the inexplicably infectious high of digging through seemingly impossible amounts of vinyl records in the hunt for the perfect sample.

(Extinction Level Event): The Final World Front</em></a>, the 48-year-old MC returns with the sequel — his first release in 11 years. The long-awaited <a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/album/7IO9UObUD76ZCLVu3ND7tz\"><em>Extinction Level Event 2: The Wrath of God</em> </a>picks up the end of the world schtick that famously ran through his early discography, with some colorful hosting by comedian Chris Rock.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Things start strong with the intro, featuring legends Rakim and Pete Rock. Here he points to connections between what he describes as a pivotal film, 1998 movie <em>Deep Impact</em> (which he paid homage to on the original E.L.E's cover art), and the more recent 2009 film <em>2012</em> — which starred Morgan Freeman and Danny Glover respectively as Black American Presidents. He then notes how the fall-out from real-world Black president Barrack Obama could foreshadow a similar fate.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Though the project quickly shifts its focus from conspiracy theories to more universally relevant speaking notes, traversing woke Bus, super-lyrical Bus and more a more nostalgically satisfying Bus.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:core-embed/youtube {\"url\":\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9wNNpNrXPA\",\"type\":\"video\",\"providerNameSlug\":\"youtube\",\"className\":\"wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"} -->\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9wNNpNrXPA\n</div></figure>\n<!-- /wp:core-embed/youtube -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The first two singles, \"YUUUU\" and \"The Don & The Boss,\" featuring Anderson .Paak and Vybz Kartel respectively provided a slightly disjointed first impression of what to expect (especially the latter song). Luckily, Busta does a good job balancing upper echelon bars and thematic verses with his sometimes looser approach that hinges more on his unique style than hyper-focused topics.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>From this end, we get instances of cipher Bus, like on the Dilla and Pete Rock-produced \"Strap Yourself Down\" and the Preemo-produced \"True Indeed,\" juxtaposed against more sociopolitical, timely content (see \"Freedom?\"). However, the project feels like it's most poignant when Busta gets his most personal.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The self-produced \"Deep Thought\" sees him lamenting on his father's 2014 death and reiterating a long-held belief that his one-manager Chris Lighty's 2012 death was a murder — by the hand of his wife, Veronica. It's a take first publically put on the record in detail during the season three premiere of TV One's <em>Celebrity Crime Files</em>.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:core-embed/youtube {\"url\":\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KiT9bYg6414\",\"type\":\"video\",\"providerNameSlug\":\"youtube\",\"className\":\"wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"} -->\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KiT9bYg6414\n</div></figure>\n<!-- /wp:core-embed/youtube -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>BET's Best Lyricist of the Year <a href=\"https://hiphopdx.com/news/id.58697/title.rapsody-proudly-accepts-2020-bet-lyricist-of-the-year-award-women-dont-always-get-represented\">Rapsody</a> also elevates the soulful Nottz-produced \"Best I Can,\" where Busta passionately addresses a baby mother voiced by the North Carolina MC. He did go through a real-life bitter custody battle with ex Joanne Wood back in 2006; if this song is rooted in reality, it's mindbending that he had Rap illustrate Wood's perceived perspective of their co-parenting situation.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Eleven years is a very long time, and the industry has shifted dramatically in terms of the contemporary sounds that rules the day; thus, there are spots where the album does show its age. An example is \"Where I Belong,\" featuring Mariah Carey. The song isn't bad — endearingly, it feels like an alternate version of their previous collaboration, \"<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WDaNJW_jEBo\">I Know What You Want</a>.\" It's a bop, even giving a fast-rap nod to his iconic \"Look At Me Know\" verse. Though, it feels like it was meant for a different musical climate. The same can be argued for the Rockwilder-produced \"Czar\" featuring M.O.P. — though it's undeniably alluring.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>At the apex of it all sits the album's crown jewel: the Kendrick Lamar featured \"Look Over Your Shoulder.\" K. Dot's verse had already leaked about five years ago, and this was allegedly slated to be included on <em>good kid, m.A.A.d city</em>. Hearing it in its fully realized context makes it that more special. It's likely that this will find itself becoming one of the more essential gems in his catalog. This is the song that 2020 Hip Hop lovers deserve.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:core-embed/youtube {\"url\":\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yl_-3oSlWaU\",\"type\":\"video\",\"providerNameSlug\":\"youtube\",\"className\":\"wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"} -->\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yl_-3oSlWaU\n</div></figure>\n<!-- /wp:core-embed/youtube -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>There's been some Busta Rhymes slander among the new school of listeners ignorant of his eldest hits, and <em>E.L.E. 2</em> more than asserts his dominance. Fair, he may not be built for seamless assimilation into what's hot with the kiddies — see \"Oh No\" as an example. Though, when he's at his most on-brand, the results are indisputably top-tier.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The project is long, and some of the songs may not have the replay value of its heartiest servings, but it's easy to understand why Busta is so emotionally attached to it. If this is his last lap, he leaves fans with gems to add to their list of reasons why he remains amongst the greats.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:core-embed/youtube {\"url\":\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GR23EIxjtM\",\"type\":\"video\",\"providerNameSlug\":\"youtube\",\"className\":\"wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"} -->\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GR23EIxjtM\n</div></figure>\n<!-- /wp:core-embed/youtube -->",

In embodying this anti-conformist, imaginative comic book villain persona, he could take his work in exciting directions — while maintaining an underground dominance that allowed him to shatter the commercial glass ceilings placed above artists that exist in the fringe.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:core-embed/youtube {\"url\":\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ewc1hixzYPY\",\"type\":\"video\",\"providerNameSlug\":\"youtube\",\"className\":\"wp-embed-aspect-4-3 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"} -->\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-4-3 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ewc1hixzYPY\n</div></figure>\n<!-- /wp:core-embed/youtube -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The most interesting part, though, was his attempt to, unlike other artists, separate the man behind the man from the music. Sure, we were aware that Dumile, formerly known as Zev Love X of the trio KMD, was DOOM — but that didn't matter. We were here to hear and see the character he fabricated.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The separation of Daniel Dumile from the metal fisted supervillain (as a character he became on record) went from artist statement to actual practice in his later career. He unleashed DOOM imposters at live shows, causing chaotic inconvenience that has gone on to be some of the most memorable concert experiences some have ever had (myself included).</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:core-embed/youtube {\"url\":\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9pbQN-K3RI\",\"type\":\"video\",\"providerNameSlug\":\"youtube\",\"className\":\"wp-embed-aspect-4-3 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"} -->\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-4-3 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9pbQN-K3RI\n</div></figure>\n<!-- /wp:core-embed/youtube -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Even with this kind of douchebaggery, there was (for some) a view that things were — in a way — playing out like one of his iconic, stitched together skits. A move becoming of the supervillain he'd become synonymous with within his career.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>DOOM fans are pretty direct — as are his detractors, which is, frankly, understandable. His music doesn't feel created for mass consumption from the mainstream, especially in his early years. Legendary DJ Stretch Armstrong recalled him in those days, as the rapper/producer would create music in his home.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>\"Every time I'd come home, there he was, digging through my shelves,\" the DJ tweeted on New Year's Eve. \"Sampling, looping, layering, and rhyming quietly ... creating a whole world in my home studio.\" </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>My second professional piece as a writer was an email interview with rapper Kurious Jorge. He was on the Columbia Records roster alongside Nas in the Illmatic era — and an early DOOM collaborator (in his newly post-KMD period). In conversation about the MC, he described his creative process as \"sloppy perfection.\"</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:core-embed/youtube {\"url\":\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ldikD78vTw\",\"type\":\"video\",\"providerNameSlug\":\"youtube\",\"className\":\"wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"} -->\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ldikD78vTw\n</div></figure>\n<!-- /wp:core-embed/youtube -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I think about that often — and it's accuracy in describing the infatuation we had with his music and (maybe more than that) the idea he represented in its purest form. It took odd-ball schticks like personality hopping Kool Keith and perfected it while seemingly reverting to (at first) an almost DIY quality aesthetic rich in oddity and inexplicable essence.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The ultimate irony is that he became a hero by fostering a supervillain's role — inspiring countless artists to create without boundary. While it is sad that we'll never some of those projects we've always yearned for (i.e., a Ghostface duet album), he left us with a lot of music to treasure. He's a voice I've turned to a lot in my headphones for the better part of the adult life, and his perspective on Hip Hop will be sorely missed.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Signed, a DOOM fan.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:html -->\n<blockquote class=\"instagram-media\" data-instgrm-captioned=\"\" data-instgrm-permalink=\"https://www.instagram.com/tv/CJiH7cbpScj/?utm_source=ig_embed&utm_campaign=loading\" data-instgrm-version=\"13\" style=\" background:#FFF;

    "content_html": "<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>There is a level of everyday humanity often absent from Hip Hop music; that's understandable, especially if you've been following the twist, turns, and dysmorphic transformations the culture has taken. Once big industry moved in, things got glitzy. There are plenty of artists who happen to share a connection to the old-world order. One who I've taken in quite consistently when approached by him is Mr. P Chill — a Sacramento native whose been on the grind since the 80s. Now in his 40s (46 to be exact, as he reveals in a vat on his new LP), his music continues to grow and reflect his life as it is; that is the backbone of the charm dripping from his recently released <em>L.I.F.E. - Living In Fragile Environments</em>, the follow-up to 2018's <em>Funky Uncle Chill</em>.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>His 11-song, fourteenth release (consisting of new and already released material) teeters on a brink; he sounds understandably worn out [not in a bad way] from what's been a 28-year roller coaster while remaining sonically dedicated and endearingly energized in attempting to find his talk through the challenges of finding his space within the sphere of Hip Hop culture. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The years spent on his craft are weaved throughout the set, \"This Circus,\" for example. But his journey is only a part of this album's narrative; there is resilience and conviction in the face of the current climate — like contemplating the connection between the murky uncertainty of the American health system and his mortality on the unexpectedly deep \"Morning Coffee.\" He also shares commentary on the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and initial 2020 lockdowns on \"Social Distancing.\"</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:core-embed/youtube {\"url\":\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fy96b1Rp2Gk\",\"type\":\"video\",\"providerNameSlug\":\"youtube\",\"className\":\"wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"} -->\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fy96b1Rp2Gk\n</div></figure>\n<!-- /wp:core-embed/youtube -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Still, the project hits its stride at its political fare, and its line posse cut Subliminal — featuring J.Smo, AlphiyOda1, and Mike Colossal. \"Millions of Militants\" is an audible pledge of solidarity with the Black Lives Movement and a call to take up arms in the ever-raging war against injustice. The clever layering of the Chuck D sample creates an almost hypnotic effect on the beat.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:core-embed/youtube {\"url\":\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZYi3y-H6Ws\",\"type\":\"video\",\"providerNameSlug\":\"youtube\",\"className\":\"wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"} -->\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZYi3y-H6Ws\n</div></figure>\n<!-- /wp:core-embed/youtube -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Speaking of the beats, Mr. P Chill is excellent on the boards; taking the song \"Diggin' (Crate Digger's Anthem)\" at face value, you can almost picture him assembling the loops that became the project's soundscape. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Many reflective themes on the LP may go over the head tops of youthful listeners; there is something so necessary about his perspective. The project caps off with \"Reflections.\" It's a look at where he's from, a show of appreciation for those who've helped him, and a sign his tank is far from empty. \"28 years so far, and I've got another 28 years in me at least,\" he notes as the album wraps.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Age doesn't count in the booth — and the music feels better when it comes from the heart. L.I.F.E. indirectly anneals itself to both points. As long as the love remains intact, and the world continues to precariously wade in perpetual volatility, it's unlikely his pen will stop moving anytime soon.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:core-embed/youtube {\"url\":\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQWijZtptVY\",\"type\":\"video\",\"providerNameSlug\":\"youtube\",\"className\":\"wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"} -->\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQWijZtptVY\n</div></figure>\n<!-- /wp:core-embed/youtube -->",

This time around, he's connected with Jamaica Queens MC L.O.U. (who he last associated with for the poignant \"The Preordained\") for a new posse cut \"Avenue Of The Aspects\" featuring Doughboy Tony, P-Rawb, and singer Shari. The track is the second single from his upcoming LP <em>Journey of Choices: (An Awakening Mind</em>).</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Sewn together with a heavy-handed and oddly emotive piano pattern, the chorus-free track (which instead uses movie clips to break up verses) sees the three MCs trading verses packed with gems, reflections, and bars. It's brimming with a motivational tome — capped off with Shari's silky vocals as the song comes to a smooth landing. It's a vibe counter to the mainstream fodder playlisted in droves.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>L.O.U.'s output hasn't been abundant in recent years — with his previous Big O-produced gem dropping last year and his previous full-length, Who Would've Known (featuring a fire Skyzoo verse) dropping about four years earlier. Still, his prior few offerings have been exciting looks at what's to come.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>Jamaica Queens MC L.O.U. & UK Producer Big O Reconnect For “The Preordained” [<a href=\"http://aboveaveragehiphop.com/unsignedhype-jamaica-queens-mc-l-o-u-uk-producer-big-o-reconnect-for-the-preordained/\">read here</a>]</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>P-Rawb has actually on a great run right now, with his latest LP with Big O, The Complexity, still getting spins just over two months after dropping.

Dipped in a deliciously 90s aesthetic, DJ Chuck, ELIMN8, and DJisLORD hit me up with a pair of joints: a single from their (still fresh) 2018 release, <em><a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/album/3G9Pbfl0dOAPnoUFcC9pDs\">The B.L.A.C.K. Odyssey </a></em>(\"It's All Love\") and a b-side from the same album, recently unearthed from the original sessions.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Produced by Chuck, \"It's All Love\" is particularly intriguing in its relatability. He sets things off, lamenting his catholic school experience, dubbing hip-hop off the radio (an OCD affection I also shared), and living life in a daze of childhood innocence. ELIMN8 recalls overcoming speech therapy and partial deafness as a child to earning a college degree as a byproduct of those who lifted him. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:core-embed/youtube {\"url\":\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g13W9uj0Nfg\",\"type\":\"video\",\"providerNameSlug\":\"youtube\",\"className\":\"wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"} -->\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g13W9uj0Nfg\n</div></figure>\n<!-- /wp:core-embed/youtube -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The song is accompanied by a GreenGreeem-directed visual that captures the feel perfectly, from the deliciously west-coast scenery and light leaks to the moving backdrop cutaways reminiscent of Dj Jazzy Jeff & the Fresh Prince's \"Summertime\" scenes on the moving truck. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>While \"It's All Love\" feels like an afternoon smoke session where you reminisce on yesteryear with your homies, the lost b-side \"Cruise Control\" feels like later that night, with the two MCs going back and forth about after-hours movements through the city of angels. Being the guys they are, that means Galaga & brew with a shorty, streaming Street Fighter, eating tacos, and just, for lack of an unnecessarily deep explanation, enjoying a relatably typical night. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Chuck crushes this instrumental, as well, from top to bottom (which includes cuts by LORD).</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:core-embed/youtube {\"url\":\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XM-uZU7RKm8\",\"type\":\"video\",\"providerNameSlug\":\"youtube\",\"className\":\"wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"} -->\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XM-uZU7RKm8\n</div></figure>\n<!-- /wp:core-embed/youtube -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>It's all very refreshing, to be honest; I've always found them appealing for this very reason. In a contemporary space that thrives off of gimmicks, bravado, and a whole lot of \"gang gang\" shit, this type of aura feels like a lost relic: cats that love the spirit of hip-hop making that laid back Cali-boom bap long lost in the shuffle. It sounds made for live performance—which isn't a mistake.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Hip-hop is more than what it's become commercially and more than its sonic opposite: a more aggressively conscious brand of socio-political movement anthems.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Honor Flow Productions takes me back to sitting outside with my crew on Friday and Saturday night, getting lifted, and making pause tapes off college radio.

    "content_html": "<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Anyone who knows me knows I'm a sucker for lo-fi instrumental albums. At the same time, I love working with music, especially throughout the process of my new book, but as a hardcore listener, I find it's distracting to refrain from analyzing the bars as I hear them. So instrumental albums are my ace. A recent LP I was wearing out was Max I Million's <em><a href=\"https://www.fatbeats.com/products/max-i-million-uncut-gems-lp-blue-w-white-splatter-vinyl\">Uncut Gems</a></em> that I received in a care package from the good homies at Coalmine Records.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>But the last few weeks have been harder on my brain than usual, and London-based producer, Big O, has a new LP (<em><a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/album/37RREfmcPsg9wTv5WogzIY\">The Mind's Mirror</a></em>) that has been such a refreshing, creative soundtrack to my movements. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The project at 20 joints, chopped and sizzled to perfection with a healthy variety of vibes and admirably one-point sequencing. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {\"id\":28770,\"sizeSlug\":\"large\"} -->\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"http://aboveaveragehiphop.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Attachment_1579904167-1100x1100.jpeg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-28770\"/></figure>\n<!-- /wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>It's interesting how it starts as a premium lo-fi Spotify playlist, with the opener \"Unfulfilled Desires\" and the follow-up \"Imagined Scenario,\" which are hot but sport a noticeably familiar sonic aesthetic that had me feeling quite comfortable. BUT, when that Dilla-esque soul flip at the end of the latter track came on, I knew this was special. Things speed up and slow down at will, floating you above a sonic tapestry woven with tons of really creative little clips.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>A good example is a skit on \"Don't Heckle Me,\" with a gentleman cussing out a heckler, which leads the transition into the soulful second half.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>There are some highlights for me; I played a lot of \"Visionary Fantasy\" featuring Melvin Toussaint & Onisor Rodila, with the delicious vibed-out guitar, oh man. The saxophone on \"<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://big-o.bandcamp.com/track/everlasting-time-feat-cancori\">Everlasting Time\" with CanCori</a> was also something I ran back a few times. Then there was \"<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://big-o.bandcamp.com/track/watchujuannado-feat-abel-boquera-2\">WatchuJuannaDo\" featuring Abel Boquera</a>, which sounds like a neo-soul love child of MF DOOM's \"Gas Drawls\" and R.Kelly's \"Step In The Name Of Love,\" to me anyway [I'm intense].</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:core-embed/youtube {\"url\":\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1r0s53lst4\",\"type\":\"video\",\"providerNameSlug\":\"youtube\",\"className\":\"wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"} -->\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1r0s53lst4\n</div></figure>\n<!-- /wp:core-embed/youtube -->\n\n<!-- wp:core-embed/youtube {\"url\":\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0R1xkzo3nU\",\"type\":\"video\",\"providerNameSlug\":\"youtube\",\"className\":\"wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"} -->\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0R1xkzo3nU\n</div></figure>\n<!-- /wp:core-embed/youtube -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>It's one of those projects that I'd be happy to learn is connected to other projects; after a few listens, I could almost hear rappers on these beats, especially with this many flavors. I could see someone in Griselda's vein, like Boldy James, eating on \"Mind Glitch,\" for example.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Instrumental albums aren't an easy feat; without the songs themselves, the producer is left to sequence by vibes, which is a delicate balance. Too much in one direction or the other can make a project bland, or ho-hum and forgettable in a dose too small.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Big O manages to walk the line, with enough going on to keep you engaged all the way through. It has an almost sunny, West Coast disposition about it. Crate diggers and lo-fi junkies will find a lot to love here.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Early.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:html -->\n<iframe src=\"https://open.spotify.com/embed/album/37RREfmcPsg9wTv5WogzIY\" width=\"100%\" height=\"380\" frameBorder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allow=\"encrypted-media\"></iframe>\n<!-- /wp:html -->",

    "content_html": "<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>As someone who spends sleepless nights combing the darkest corners of the internet for obscure songs and rips of vinyl records from yesteryear and hard-to-download gems, no album in recent memory has fascinated me more than <a href=\"http://aboveaveragehiphop.com/wu-tang-clan-a-better-tommorow-review/\">Wu-Tang Clan</a>'s <em><a href=\"https://www.okayplayer.com/music/who-bought-wu-tang-clan-album-once-upon-a-time-in-shaolin.html?utm_source=pocket_saves\">Once Upon A Time In Shaolin</a></em>, produced by Cilvaringz and including all original clan members, Redman and even Cher (surprisingly). </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The album, recorded in the Moroccan mountains, only has a single copy encased in a silver jewel-encrusted box with a wax Wu-Tang Clan seal and leather-bound liner notes.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Eventually, the album was sold in an auction to pharma tech bro Martin Shkreli in 2015, and to date, he remains one of the few people to have ever laid ears on it. While extreme, RZA explained that the album was akin to an artistic masterpiece like the Mona Lisa. He isn't wrong, and the project's creation and sale were a powerful hyperbolic example of how artists can and should place value on their work.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:html -->\n<img src=\"https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5931ccc0d4294b0bc2dd85dd/2:1/w_2560%2Cc_limit/bf238d4d.jpg\" width=\"100%\" alt=\"Vinyl Records Mach Hommy Wu-Tang\">\n<!-- /wp:html -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>Collections Used To Mean Something</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>There was a time when an extensive music collection said something about a person. In the past, 'Release Tuesday' often involved a coordinated game plan to ensure you could get the most for your money. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The average intake on an average Friday now would have cost hundreds of dollars in the late '90s. Still, the very act of having to spend money and expend effort meant that we had a much more intimate relationship with our music, which is why so many vinyl collectors cannot part with their basements full of crates. Tangible music was an investment.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Over the past 20+ years, technology has changed the music industry from the introduction of iTunes to the rise of streaming. It's hard to argue against the convenience that these developments have brought. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I remember the days of trying to cut down on space by painstakingly creating mixtapes of all the songs I foresaw myself wanting to bump on a particular day. Now, one only needs to exist and consume, with algorithms tracking your habits and serving you what they perceive you to like. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>For those fond of expertly curated lists, plenty of playlists are ripe with the newest heat rocks, ready to go. The problem becomes the hi-and-bye nature of it all, with feverish release cycles and a lowered cost of entry resulting in more music than one can digest coming at us like clockwork. It's more difficult for projects to maintain attention lifespans for longer than a week.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The result? Great albums are wading in a sea of disposable music. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>However, amid the growth of a landscape where less tangible, subscription-based models are prioritized over more tangible, traditional experiences, some artists are finding ways to get to the bag, cultivate strong, reliable fan bases, and live outside the standard industry model--a la Wu-Tang <em>One Night In Shaolin</em>.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Real independence ... it's exciting as hell.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>The Resurgence Of Vinyl Records</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>A key driver of this tangible movement is the resurgence of vinyl records, with sales of new records doubling yearly since 2020, according to a piece by Rolling Stone. But much like when your favorite underground rapper goes pop, big business can tend to make things muddy.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p> Adele's latest album, <em>30</em>, sold more than 300,000 copies on vinyl, and Taylor Swift's <em>Midnight </em>did similar numbers, but large-scale albums create a strain on the few available vinyl pressers. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>One of the few North American plant owners, Jack White of the White Stripes--in conversation with The Detroit News--has asked major labels to invest in their plants to help shoulder the burden.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The past few years have seen a rise in vinyl records dropping with overseas pressers like Copenhagen Crates and Air Vinyl and established pressers like Daupe from Griselda. However, this often makes expensive records even pricier due to costly currency exchanges and shipping fees. Despite this, the exclusivity of owning a physical thing can be very rewarding.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Some collectors pride themselves on owning rare or exclusive releases, creating a divide between them and more casual listeners. Artists like Mach-Hommy are fulfilling this niche with ease. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>While some projects may eventually make their way onto streaming services, it can take years (like with Westside Gunn's <em><a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/album/6ZOa1wCHW2fZlsIYh8Yyw4?autoplay=true\">Flygod</a></em>, which wasn't available on DSPs until 2020). Mach, who refers to his fans as \"investors,\" isn't afraid to sell a digital version of a 4-song EP for $222, and fans are willing to pay this high price for exclusive access to his music.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:html -->\n<img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0576/3180/1542/products/TrizTestPresings_a74e8ccf-536c-4d23-bfb9-74a403084d3c_1024x1024@2x.jpg?v=1677913152\" width=\"100%\" alt=\"Vinyl Records Mach Hommy Wu-Tang\">\n<!-- /wp:html -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Most recently,<a href=\"https://billy-z.com/\"> his <em>Trizz</em> collection</a>, including <em>Triz Nathaniel</em>, <em>Triz Nathan</em>, <em>Triz Nate</em> and <em>Triz 9</em> (produced by Nicholas Craven, SadhuGold, Tha God Fahim, and Conductor Williams), can each be purchased for $111. However, the catch is that they are packaged like mystery Pokemon cards, so fans won't know what they are getting until they open the package. Buying all four records could cost a lot of money, but an investor box for $999 offers a better chance of getting them all and some extra items to keep or sell.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Elcamino's <em>Here You Go</em> release, limited to 500 colored LPs worldwide, is also only available on vinyl. There is no plan for a digital release, so fans must purchase the LP to hear it. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Sadhugold's projects with Spook, like <em><a href=\"https://sadhu-gold.bandcamp.com/album/n-s-f-w-nigga-scarecrow-for-whitefolk\">N.S.F.W.</a></em>, <em>Spook & Friends Presents: <a href=\"https://sadhu-gold.bandcamp.com/album/spook-friends-presents-no-country-for-hoe-niggas-if-you-white-dont-play\">No Country for Hoe Niggas</a></em>, and recently <em><a href=\"https://sadhu-gold.bandcamp.com/album/no-country-ll-hell-on-wheels-the-ballad-of-isom-dart\">No Country ll: Hell on Wheels (The Ballad Of Isom Dart!)</a></em>, are unstreamable beyond a few select tracks and require listeners to purchase the digital album. Another great example was his limited-time release of a mixtape full of unreleased Westside Gunn remixes (only available for 24 hours).</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The list goes on. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>Price <em>Still Matters</em> For Casuals</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The reality is that many average listeners are conditioned not to see music's value. For example, Talib Kweli and Madlib's Liberation 2 LP, which is a contender for album of the year, is available on Luminary for $7.99. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>However, some fans cannot wrap their minds around paying for it via a Luminary subscription. It's a longstanding issue; a survey from 2003 showed that 61% of listeners found Apple's $0.99 price per song too expensive.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Two decades later, some people still view paying $10 for access to every album as 'excessive capitalism.'</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>There will always be two classes of music listeners. Still, this is an exciting time for the music industry, with more ways than ever for fans to invest in niche subsets and grow with them without worrying about intermediaries siphoning the profit. As the landscape continues to evolve, it's interesting to see where this new golden era of tangible music collections will take us.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->",

I wanted to manage him,\" Rim says of his music industry origins. \"I'm a fan of his ... he just don't wanna do it no more, but he's nice. At that time, I wanted to manage him, but he wanted me to rap with him.\"</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The two became a duo, and though they weren't doing much (in his words), things took a turn when he met the late Sean Price, who took Rim and P under his wing.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>\"I knew who Ruck was from hearing his name in the street,\" he recounts. \"I'm from Brownsville, and he's from Brownsville.

I was like, man, you don't Ruck.” </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Humorously, Rim notes that Sean has the same reaction when told by Rich that he knew Rim.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>\"But after that, I realized, 'Okay, he's playing our music,' you know what I mean? So, I let some time pass because I didn't have his contact information, and I didn't want my man, Rich, to go back and forth for me,\" he explains. \"I wanted to introduce myself personally. So I was going to wait until I saw him again. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>\"One day I hit him on Twitter, and I was like, 'Yo, what's good, how much for a feature?' And he was like '$1.99' or some crazy like that.

The core members (Bub, Spoda, Eddie Kaine and Rome Streetz) had initially connected either individually or online; it was incredibly organic. For example, Rim credits his associate Jazz for sharing the track by Bub Rock produced by Wavy Da Ghawd that first got him to follow and eventually connect with the MC. He first got introduced to Rome's music through Big Ghost and soon after began chopping it up. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Kaine, he notes, was already his friend.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The true genesis of the collective, though, was K.Burn's 2018 New Golden Era Concert in Brooklyn—when they all finally met in person.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Shortly after this meeting, Rim also brought Detroit MC Ty Farris into the fold.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>As a collective, they've grown to include a mix of producers and artists: The Standouts, Don Carrera, Wavy Da Ghawd, The Artivist, Code Nine, Chyna Streetz, Aida, Passport Rav, Emilio Craig, Ox Omni, Odawg and Frankky Smaccz. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The group's most recognizable member to date has been Rome Streetz, who, after a series of acclaimed collaborative LPs—notably<em> Death & The Magician</em> with the legendary DJ Muggs—has broken out as a member of Griselda, dropping his imprint debut <em>Kiss The Ring</em> late last year.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>“We were always trying to make a name for ourselves; Rome was killing it though … he just elevated,” he exclaims.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:embed {\"url\":\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Exqu7UYrJHY\\u0026pp=ygUJZGF2aWxsaW5z\",\"type\":\"video\",\"providerNameSlug\":\"youtube\",\"responsive\":true,\"className\":\"wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"} -->\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Exqu7UYrJHY&pp=ygUJZGF2aWxsaW5z\n</div></figure>\n<!-- /wp:embed -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>While everybody has spent the years since 2018 making their moves, as folks often do in collectives—trying to find their lanes—Rim clarifies that their camaraderie has remained intact. \"We always kept cooling … we worked on a few songs [collectively].\"</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>If this is your first time hearing about The Walkers, reviewing the member's catalogs reveals plenty of collaboration and cross-pollination.

    "content_html": "<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>An AI-generated reference track for the iconic song \"Still D.R.E.\" was dropped in our DMs by an anonymous Reddit user, and we knew we needed to share it. Despite being clearly artificial, it's surprisingly cathartic to listen to.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<p>https://youtu.be/y8FmDMkm3S8?si=OgTJ-ORL45OYQ91l</p>\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>To explain, hip-hop is aging. Die-hard fans in their late 30s to early 40s have endured years of lore from the pre-internet era. For example:</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:list -->\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\"><!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li>There's no footage of <a href=\"https://youtu.be/IZ9EJLV4WhE?si=BfcJWVXJ7PvjBpy7\">Biggie and 2Pac</a> freestyling at Madison Square Garden.</li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item -->\n\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li>Nas never returned to the studio to record his remix verse for Biggie's \"<a href=\"https://youtu.be/dvZARv4hPNs?si=x09RWQ8VmSuLbkZ9\">Gimme The Loot</a>.\"</li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item -->\n\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li>We never got the ‘<a href=\"https://youtu.be/j_kalpO9NH8?si=CjH_DtHwMmvKiWUM\">more savage</a>’ original version of Nas' \"Ether.”</li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>\n<!-- /wp:list -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The list goes on, but the fabled reference track for \"Still D.R.E.,\" arguably the West Coast Zeus' signature record, remains one of the most elusive. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/fakeshoredrive/status/1398463760558395400?lang=en\">Andrew Barber</a> once tweeted, \"I'd pay top dollar to hear Hov's reference track for 'Still D.R.E.' Doing both Snoop and Dre's part. It's out there. Somewhere.\"</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Jay-Z wrote the song for Dr. Dre and Snoop for the 1999 album <em>2001</em>, allegedly creating a reference track where he imitated both their flows. Snoop Dogg even revealed that Hov wrote the entire track in less than an hour.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<p>https://youtu.be/_CL6n0FJZpk?si=bH5Nzt2jsO7bKJha</p>\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>\"Still D.R.E.\" was a commercial success, peaking at No. 93 on the Billboard Hot 100 and No. 30 on the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart. The single was certified platinum by the RIAA in 2022, signifying over 1 million units sold.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The song significantly contributed to the success of 2001, which debuted at No. 2 on the Billboard 200 and has been certified 6x platinum, selling over 6 million copies in the U.S. alone.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>While the original recording, if it still exists, will likely never see the light of day, the AI version oddly scratches the itch.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Ethics in AI Music</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>To be clear, we fundamentally oppose the exploitation of AI music. For example, using Drake, The Weeknd, and others to create brand new songs with \"original\" lyrics and monetizing those records is unacceptable. However, there's a grey area concerning reference tracks.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>An example would be Cipha Sounds replacing the more or less cancelled <a href=\"http://aboveaveragehiphop.com/cipha-sounds-uses-ai-to-replace-diddy-with-jadakiss-on-its-all-about-the-benjamins-remix-amidst-legal-issues/\">Diddy on \"All About The Benjamins\" with Jadakiss</a>, who actually wrote the original verse. There are also instances of AI being used for positive purposes, like reconstructing <a href=\"http://aboveaveragehiphop.com/still-funky-enough-interview-with-d-o-c/\">The D.O.C.</a>'s original voice (from before his accident) to help him make new music.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Seeing the technology used in powerful ways that don't take food off plates and simultaneously help fans fill in blank spots is as inspiring as it is inevitable.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->",

    "content_html": "<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>New York-based media personality and <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/iampvnch?igsh=MW9qbDhybmJ5bTBhMw==\">DJ Pvnch</a>, known for his work with controversial rapper <a href=\"https://youtu.be/veeOhdDuW4Y?si=786jatWxa-jE0uHU\">6ix9ine</a>, recently appeared on The Jay Hill Podcast. During the candid discussion, Pvnch raised concerns about the age disparity in hip-hop charts and called for changes in how the industry categorizes artists.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>In a clip shared to <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/reel/C85VKq9ywq3/?igsh=MTN5ZG16b2Z6MWl5Ng==\">Jay Hill’s Instagram</a>, Pvnch highlighted the stark contrast between established artists and newcomers competing on the same charts. \"If Jay-Z drops tomorrow, Jay-Z should not be competing with Ice Spice,\" he stated, emphasizing the vast difference in experience and career longevity. He further questioned, \"Why is Nas on the same chart as 310 Baby?\"</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The DJ argued for the creation of an \"adult hip-hop\" category, suggesting that veteran artists shouldn't have to compete with artists who are just starting their careers. \"There need to be an adult hip-hop,\" Pvnch asserted, pointing out the unfairness of having legendary artists like Too Short competing against artists who \"just finished chemistry homework.\"</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Pvnch also touched on what he called the \"Flex problem,\" referring to <a href=\"http://aboveaveragehiphop.com/funkmaster-flex-questions-authenticity-of-drake-vs-kendrick-lamar-feud/\">DJ Funkmaster Flex</a>. He suggested that established DJs like Flex fear losing their positions to up-and-coming talents, creating a competitive environment where there's a perceived scarcity of opportunities. \"He's scared of his spot because he's like, there's a nigga running so fast, he's going to take my spot,\" Pvnch explained, adding that the real issue is the belief that \"there's one spot\" when there should be room for multiple successful DJs.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The discussion then shifted to the lack of platforms for veteran artists. Pvnch questioned why established names like Noriega, Snoop Dogg, Jay-Z, Nas, and Styles P can't release new music without feeling pressured to compete with younger artists for chart positions and relevance. He argued that these artists aren't aiming for the same demographic as newer acts, yet the current system forces them into direct competition.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>When the conversation turned to recent Grammy winner Killer Mike, Pvnch offered a nuanced take on industry recognition versus mainstream popularity. While acknowledging Killer Mike's Grammy win, Pvnch argued that this success didn't translate to widespread appeal or club play. \"Killer Mike did not win to the masses. His records are nowhere,\" he stated, suggesting that Grammy recognition doesn't necessarily equate to commercial success or popularity among younger listeners.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Pvnch's passionate discourse highlights the ongoing debate about age and relevance in hip-hop. Finding a way to celebrate new talent and veterans without direct competition is important for the health and diversity of our hip-hop culture.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<p>Watch the clip below.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"instagram-media\" data-instgrm-permalink=\"https://www.instagram.com/reel/C85VKq9ywq3/?utm_source=ig_embed&utm_campaign=loading\" data-instgrm-version=\"14\" style=\" background:#FFF;

    "content_html": "<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>As the dust settles on the 2024 Paris Olympics, the debut of breakdancing as an Olympic sport remains a topic of heated discussion. This milestone event, occurring just a year after hip-hop's 50th anniversary, marks a significant moment for the culture's global recognition.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>LL Cool J, a hip-hop icon, recently shared his thoughts on the subject during an interview on <a href=\"https://sxm.app.link/PRlink-Shade45\">SiriusXM's</a> <em>CTRL, ALT, D-Stroy</em> show. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>\"I'm so happy about hip hop culture,\" he said, expressing his hope that breaking would return for the 2028 games. \"I do know that the breakers will be even better in the 2028 games. There were a lot of great ones out there, don't get me wrong, but I think that it will only get better and stronger.\"</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The inclusion of breakdancing in the Olympics represents a culmination of decades of evolution. From its roots in the Bronx in the 1970s to its global spread, breaking has become a powerful form of self-expression and competition. The Olympic stage offered a platform for this art form to showcase its athleticism, creativity, and cultural significance to a worldwide audience.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>However, the historic nature of breaking's Olympic debut was overshadowed by controversy surrounding Australian contestant <a href=\"https://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/raygun-addresses-devastating-olympic-cheating-rumors-and-bullying/\">Rachael Gunn</a>, known as Raygun. Her unconventional performance, which included moves like the \"kangaroo hop,\" drew widespread criticism and ridicule. Questions arose about her skill level and the legitimacy of her selection, though <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/raygun-husband-olympics-committee-rumors-false-qualification-2024-8\">Ausbreaking</a>, the official Australian breakdancing body, firmly denied any impropriety in the selection process.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Despite the backlash, Raygun defended her approach, emphasizing the importance of originality and artistic expression in breaking. This controversy highlights the ongoing debate about judging criteria and the balance between tradition and innovation in the sport.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>As breaking faces an uncertain Olympic future, having already been excluded from the 2028 Los Angeles games, the community remains hopeful. LL Cool J's words echo the sentiments of many: \"You just have to give it some time and I feel good about it man. I love this culture. I love hip hop, man. I love it.\"</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<blockquote class=\"instagram-media\" data-instgrm-captioned data-instgrm-permalink=\"https://www.instagram.com/reel/C-qmwjcPFoK/?utm_source=ig_embed&utm_campaign=loading\" data-instgrm-version=\"14\" style=\" background:#FFF;

    "excerpt": null,
    "content_html": "<!-- wp:paragraph {\"className\":\"p1\"} -->\n<p class=\"p1\">It’s been 26 years since Slick Rick, one of the genre’s greatest storytellers, released his comeback LP <em><a href=\"https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLBbRwi8rtFNrrIy4Ni8SdKKJgWsL12iaD&si=C9Z051BEX6lHzEC7\">The Art of Storytelling</a></em>, following a jail sentence that more or less shelved the trajectory of his promising career during the lion’s share of the ’90s golden era.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph {\"className\":\"p1\"} -->\n<p class=\"p1\">That’s not to say he isn’t cemented among the greatest to ever do it; it just means that with one undeniable classic, two rushed efforts recorded while out on bail (and a subsequent stint on work release), capped off by a fourth album that dropped just before the turn of the century, Rick has been largely absent from hip-hop’s evolving narrative.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph {\"className\":\"p1\"} -->\n<p class=\"p1\">For an entire generation, he’s more “the guy who made ‘Children’s Story’” than the mind-bendingly clever MC who inspired your favorite rapper’s favorite rapper.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph {\"className\":\"p1\"} -->\n<p class=\"p1\">But with <em>Victory</em>, he returns not as a nostalgia act, but as a craftsman with something to say. Self-produced for the most part, the project finds Rick curating a surprisingly fresh tapestry of sounds that span spry loops, island-tinged rhythms, and streaks of ’90s house. Interspersed with skits, it’s an enjoyable—albeit incredibly brief—listen at just over 27 minutes.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:embed {\"url\":\"https://youtu.be/zZk2wpt_w4Y?si=xJUTpeoGxhroQbpj\\u0026utm_source=ZTQxO\",\"type\":\"video\",\"providerNameSlug\":\"youtube\",\"responsive\":true,\"className\":\"wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"} -->\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\nhttps://youtu.be/zZk2wpt_w4Y?si=xJUTpeoGxhroQbpj&utm_source=ZTQxO\n</div></figure>\n<!-- /wp:embed -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph {\"className\":\"p1\"} -->\n<p class=\"p1\">Things start off strong with the Giggs-assisted “<a href=\"https://youtu.be/ljN19E7294M?si=u3V9TW-TNV8DVGHZ\">Stress</a>,” before Rick slides into the upbeat “<a href=\"https://youtu.be/9bPUlGvrFPY?si=ZiZ9Yp7WD_5qAEL9\">Angelic</a>,” co-produced with Parker Ighile and Dirty Harry.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph {\"className\":\"p1\"} -->\n<p class=\"p1\">“<a href=\"https://youtu.be/0iWO7StWPIc?si=tFsl5AFEZPH3_SiX\">Landlord</a>” is a classic Ricky D track, with the MC lamenting the struggles of collecting rent from deadbeat tenants in properties he owns across New York. It carries all the humor and detail of storytelling staples like “The Moment I Feared,” set to a smooth island groove that demands replays. Meanwhile, “So You’re Having My Baby” stands out as a personal high point—Rick’s trademark crooning bookends a dark, Billie Jean-esque narrative. Not groundbreaking, but the brooding, piano-driven beat is quietly hypnotic.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:embed {\"url\":\"https://youtu.be/nq_VGq6f8aY?si=XUq_M7bMGCpaHwb-\",\"type\":\"video\",\"providerNameSlug\":\"youtube\",\"responsive\":true,\"className\":\"wp-embed-aspect-4-3 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"} -->\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-4-3 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\nhttps://youtu.be/nq_VGq6f8aY?si=XUq_M7bMGCpaHwb-\n</div></figure>\n<!-- /wp:embed -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph {\"className\":\"p1\"} -->\n<p class=\"p1\">“<a href=\"https://youtu.be/l8WO55bG3Z0?si=C79wxIne7C0eBYIe\">Documents</a>” is one of the album’s clear standouts—a cinematic, espionage-laced cut that finds Rick weaving through a covert mission with the kind of detail and character work he’s known for. Nas delivers a smooth, layered verse that balances bravado and elegance, with lines like “Connected like Clarence Avant / Respected like Stringer Bell and Barksdale Avon.” It’s sharp, stylish, and a reminder that Rick’s pen still cuts.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph {\"className\":\"p1\"} -->\n<p class=\"p1\">Even so, things feel brief. And while it’s better to leave early than overstay your welcome, after more than two decades away, something a bit more substantial might have hit harder.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph {\"className\":\"p1\"} -->\n<p class=\"p1\">The album’s most powerful moment might come in the form of “I Did That,” a mid-project spoken-word piece delivered not over music, but beneath the soft rush of ambient water. It plays like a reflective interlude—part memoir, part mission statement. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:embed {\"url\":\"https://youtu.be/rcVv6R6i4aE?si=SUZomAvzuPXWyyyn\\u0026utm_source=ZTQxO\",\"type\":\"video\",\"providerNameSlug\":\"youtube\",\"responsive\":true,\"className\":\"wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"} -->\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\nhttps://youtu.be/rcVv6R6i4aE?si=SUZomAvzuPXWyyyn&utm_source=ZTQxO\n</div></figure>\n<!-- /wp:embed -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph {\"className\":\"p1\"} -->\n<p class=\"p1\">Rick catalogs his impact with precision and pride: “Sampled over 800 times, kid—I did that.” From Wallabees and platinum ropes to The Great Adventures and The Art of Storytelling, it’s less a flex than a living archive. And when he closes with “The poet, and the visionary. We did that,” it feels earned. Not just a callback to what was—but a quiet declaration that the Ruler still is.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->",
