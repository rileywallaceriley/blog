    "title": "Wu-Tang Clan – Changing the Game (Again)",
    "content": "In 1993, the Wu-Tang Clan released, what many would consider to be, one of the greatest albums in hip-hop history. Enter The Wu-Tang: 36 Chambers made superstars out of the nine member squad from Shaolin as well as changed the face of the music game – from a behind the scenes business standpoint. Their subsequent releases, such as Wu-Tang Forever, only solidified their legacy as did the massive catalogue that includes solo spin-offs, affiliates and so on.\n\nBut that was then, this is now. The question that is on everyone's mind – in a digital age where trap and pop reign supreme – is whether Wu-Tang Clan can still be both relevant and fresh. Whether a new generation will ever truly appreciate the magic that the first album cast on the golden era remains to be seen, but for their core audience that have grown with them, the rumors of a new album have only excited us; however talks of one-off album that would be auctioned off to the highest bidder. The rest of us would have to settle for special guarded listening sessions during a proposed museum tour. This creates an almost \"holy grail\" effect, especially since RZA himself proclaimed this to be probably the best material you've heard from the clan since their classic debut. Hard to argue with this 51 second snippet.\n\nThis new concept, as RZA puts it places value on the music as though it were a piece of art. This is something that the music industry is sorely lacking. Could this bold new direction save hip-hop (assuming you feel it needs saving)? At the very least it will surely pressure artists to be more creative with they marketing strategies.\n\nSeeing as how I don't have 5 million laying around, I'll have to line up for a copy of A Better Tomorrow – the clan's upcoming public release – when it drops.

    "content": "Commercialization of hip-hop culture during the 90s had more than one negative effect on the way we consume music. The obvious, which I’ll begin this piece by delving into, is the dictation of what we should be listening to. It’s simple really: labels spend (a lot) of money marketing the spit out of products (artists) they have huge stake in – basic business. It becomes a pay to play scenario. This model ensured that groups in the 90s that didn’t conform to a specific “emerging style/sound” had the impossible task of getting the spins and awareness necessary to generate into the big dollars. In fact many great artists and projects were shelved (think Cormega). What I mean is, cheesy cats like Hammer and Vanilla Ice (who were poster children for “rap” aka Macklemores of the day) enjoyed perks, like over the top marketing budgets, that groups like \n\nEnter Organized Konfusion – the duo of Prince Po and Pharaoh Monch – whose debut was hailed by Allmusic as “the underground hip-hop album of the 90s”. With 3 critically acclaimed albums, they never really had the proper label – nor radio – marketing support necessary to reach the masses. But they had things money could never buy: skills, authenticity and soul. Not once in any of their (three) albums, which were largely self produced and featured little to no features or filler, did they compromise their sound, or integrity as artists. In 1997, without egos or animosity, the duo decided to walk away from OK and peruse solo endeavors; although, many newer (post 1998), hip-hop “fans” are likely more familiar with the solo work of Pharaoh, largely due the massive success of his single Simon Says. Some who were in the know (about OK) thought that Prince Poetic fell off the face of the earth. Totally false!\n\nPrince Po never fell off, fact! He released his first solo project, The Slickness, in 2004 to rave reviews. He followed with two more solo releases (amidst many memorable features in the downtime), working with notable producers/artists such as Large Pro, J-Live, MF-Doom, Danger Mouse, Madlib and TOMC3 (who produced his entire 3rd release) to name a few.\n\nFor the past few years, Po has been working with Stones Throw producer/artist Oh No – who happens to be the younger brother of producer Madlib. What began as informal collaboration has led up to Animal Serum, their new project dropping February 4th. I recently spoke with Po about his career, the project and his thoughts on hip-hop.\n\nInterview below.\n\nHow did you get into hip-hop? How did you meet Pharaoh?\n\nMusic was always around me as a child. My sister was always playing funk, and we grew up in the church around gospel music. It’s always been a part of my life.\n\nPharoah and I grew up the in the same Neighbourhood (Southside Jamaica Queens). We were always familiar with each other, as we went to the same elementary and middle schools. When we got older we got more aquatinted, playing ball and stuff like that. Hip hop was just around us (the neighbourhood), there were local DJ’s who would come outside and play – progression into that was just natural. Originally he (Pharoah) was a beat boxer and I was the MC. Cats used to call hI'm Mailbox. We used to make tapes, but we were having trouble filling them, so I told hI'm he had to start writing rhymes to help me fill them up. The first rhyme he wrote was off the chain, he was a natural. From that point on we were a duo.\n\nHow did you come up with the name Organized Konfusion?\n\nOriginally we were called Simply 2 Positive. At that time, names with numbers were popular, and we were younger so we ran with it. As we got more serious we realized it needed to change (the name). We wanted something that was more general, and wasn’t attached with a niche. We didn’t want to be pigeon-holed if we experimented with different types/styles of music (like rock collabos, etc.) or different topics in our rhymes. We wanted to be able to tell different types of stories and express many different emotions. We needed a name that would really stand the test of time. We finally settled on Organized Konfusion, which is an oxymoron. When looking at the way we were going about things and living, it was definitely a fitting name.\n\nTalk a little bit about your creative process.\n\nWe just listened to what the music told us. Me an Monch would usually get together early in the morning have breakfast, brainstorm, smoke something, brainstorm more, play games — regular human shit. Then when were ready we made music. We just always wanted to make music that was adhesive, I mean, we’re from an era where you had to be original, and you couldn’t sound like the next man…you needed to stay ahead of the game. It was all about making (new) contributions to a good cause, to a powerful culture — Hip-hop is a lifestyle, it’s more than music. It’s a connection between people worldwide.\n\nHow did you make the decision to go solo?\n\nWe were stuck in between a rock and a hard place. On one hand we had people telling us “oh you guys don’t have the right promotion”, and on the other we had cats who would reference us as influential figures. Being rappers rapper is a good feeling — but, we didn’t have a niche. It’s hard for executives to really properly push artists without niches. We wanted to preserve our name and just put it on hold. Wait for a day when maybe we can work (as OK) with someone who really knows what they’re doing. There were no hard feelings at all. We went hard, we toured, did every interview we could. We made money.\n\nPharoahe expressed interest in trying a solo effort, and as for myself, I was really starting to transition my production to the digital era (pro tools, fruity loops). The game was changing and I really wanted to make sure that I was changing with it. This goes back to our mantra of staying ahead of the game. So I really went back to school with everything. I used to read the blogs and thought it was so funny how cats thought I fell off, or was smoked out and things like that – all the while, I’m in an apartment with my rent paid for 6 months making beats.\n\nTalk a bit about your latest project Animal Serum with OH NO. How did you guys link up?\n\nWe’ve been cool for years. I met Oh (and Madlib) years ago through different situations. Oh’s an exceptionally talented dude, very passionate and humble, who has music in his DNA. I could tell that we (Organized Konfusion) had an influence on them, but they (LootPack) had an influence on us. We’re both very rough edged cats, and the connection really just fell into place. We worked together and separate on this record — I went out there and we also sent stuff from studio to studio.\n\nThe project is just a good musical album. It’s very inspiring and built up of really raw funk and soul. It’s been in the making for years now. We started out more just wanting to make a few songs to see what we could do with them. It ended up becoming an full LP, and I’m really proud of it. It fits the times that we live in. It’s a rollarcoaster (of emotions) that I think touches on really relatable universal experiences. What I really want people to do is be more in tune to themselves, find more peace and more drive to do what they want to do, and get what they want to get. Songs on this album touch on that, and that’s really why I called it Animal Serum, because this is what will restore people back to their raw/strong point.\n\nIn this exclusive audio clip, Po discusses his thoughts on the current eastcoast hip-hop scene, his view on the “king of” discussion and plugs his latest release Animal Serum.\n\nAnimal Serum, featuring verses from Pharaoh Monch, O.C, Rock (of Heltah Skeltah), Safiir, Sadat X and produced entirely by Oh No is available now. Be sure to cop that, and support real hip-hop.",

    "title": "Hip-Hop and video games: The Oh No interview",
    "content": "It runs in the family.\n\nIt’s often (but not always) surprising when you realize that artists are the products of either musical parents and/or have talent in their families. This was true for artists like Prodigy of Mobb Deep, whose grandfather, Budd Johnson and great-uncle Keg Johnson were active in the Bebop era of jazz. His mother, Fatima Frances Collins, was also a member of the The Crystals, a group that cracked the Us Top 20 charts in the 60’s – side note, read his book. Then there’s Nas, whose father is jazz/blues musician Oli Dara. This is also the case with talented producer/artist Oh No – who happens to be both the son of a musician and the younger sibling of Madvillain producer Madlib aka Quasimoto.\n\nHe began his career as a rapper, even featuring on wax with his brother’s group Lootpack, but he insists that he, much like his big bro, is a producer first. Hard to disagree when you look/listen to his vast catalogue of releases and credits – from solo releases, his album with Chino XL and Roc C to his group Gangrene (with producer Alchemist).\n\nFrom working with the late great J.Dilla to scoring the fastest – and highest – selling video game of all time, Oh No has had quite the career up to this point. With his latest project Animal Serum (a collaboration with Prince Po) dropping February 4th, I was lucky enough to chat with the cali-based super producer. We touched on everything from his music, his love of video games and gambling at https://casinoenligne-francais.net/lucky31/ - to getting beat tapes from Dilla, can you even imagine?\n\nInterview below:\n\nDid you always know you wanted to be in hip-hop? I always knew I wanted to do music. From the start, when my parents brought equipment in the house, I was all on it. My mother use to have this keyboard, and she used to write music. My father (Otis Jackson) and brother (MadLib)….man, it’s in my blood. Even my kids read and write music.\n\nYou’ve been in both rapper and producer roles in your career. Which do you prefer?\n\nI prefer being the producer first, second and third. Being the rapper comes like ninth. I like rapping, don’t get me wrong, but when it comes to shows and all the production I do…all the smoke I’m smoking… It’s too hard to try to remember lyrics. I have to sit there and listen to the songs over and over to get it right. I work on a lot of projects all the time, I’m working on multiple albums each month. So I just don’t have the time to really remember each lyric.\n\nHow did you get into the game?\n\nI first started with my man J Duce. I was using my brother’s SP12 making beats, and we started our group called Kali Wild. We incorporated Cornbread from the bay and sauna aka Biggs. We made a gang of albums. going back and forth from the ox to oakland trying to get our music on my man recordings..\n\nFrom there I ended up connecting with Rasco, he was on Stones Throw at the time. He bought a single that we (Biggs and I) did. He showed it to Peanut Butter Wolf, and that’s how I ended up getting my deal.\n\nTell me about your love for video games.\n\nIve always been a crazy game collector since Atari to now with PS4 and all that. I’m also really big into PC gaming. I love simulators. I made a custom arcade that has street fighter to digital pinball on it.. Pretty much every game on it.. It’s like a virtual dave and busters over here.\n\nHow did you get into producing music for video games?\n\nI used to make beats out of video games. I would always get my beats placed and one day my man – who was working with Capcom – approached me and said I should make video game beats (specifically for Street Fighter). I told hI'm I already had a bunch. I sent over something fresh and they loved it. They asked who I wanted to work with on it, and I had just gotten Redman’s contact so I said, “how about Redman?” They made that happen.\n\nThen I started working with Alchemist and he brought Rockstar into the picture. He was working on GTA Chinatown Wars, doing the music for the radio station, so I worked with hI'm on that. I did drum work for Red Dead Redemption: Undead Nightmare. From there Rockstar approached us (Alchemist and I) about working on GTA V and creating and original soundscapes for each scene in the game. The rest is history..\n\nAnd that’s the highest selling game ever. As a serious gamer that must feel great, no?\n\nBeing a big video game collector, its crazy to have that under my belt… definitely a big deal.\n\nYou also score (shows) for Cartoon Network?\n\nYeah I do. Cartoon Network, Adult Swim, HBO, CBS, Fox. I can say the bulk of my time goes to scoring TV shows, commercials, video games and documentaries. In fact, I just finished working on a documentary with director David Paul Meyer about a great comedian Trevor Noah called You Laugh But It’s True.\n\nHow did you meet Prince Po?\n\nI met prince Po about 8 years ago while he was working with Madlib doing a song on the Percee P album (Perserverance). I started sending beats and he started calling me and spitting over the phone. It was crazy like where have you been? Let’s work! We were doing songs off and on, just seeing where it took us.\n\nI was juggling Alchemist projects and Prince Po tracks, on top of scoring, so it took a while to really get this finished. But it’s finally coming out. It’s all very next level stuff.\n\nWhat does the title Animal Serum mean to you?\n\nFor me, I feel like it’s animal blood, you know, drinking the blood of an animal. We’re really trying to regenerate that rawness. The way he’s coming at it with the lyrics is so intense. There’s a LOT of true lyricism, and that’s what we’re bringing back. That raw animal essence.\n\nIn the exclusive audio clip below, Oh No shares some Dilla memories with me.",

I would always get my beats placed and one day my man – who was working with Capcom – approached me and said I should make video game beats (specifically for Street Fighter). I told hI'm I already had a bunch. I sent over something fresh and they loved it. They asked who I wanted to work with on it, and I had just gotten Redman’s contact so I said, “how about Redman?” They made that happen.\n\nThen I started working with Alchemist and he brought Rockstar into the picture. He was working on GTA Chinatown Wars, doing the music for the radio station, so I worked with hI'm on that. I did drum work for Red Dead Redemption: Undead Nightmare. From there Rockstar approached us (Alchemist and I) about working on GTA V and creating and original soundscapes for each scene in the game. The rest is history..\n\nAnd that’s the highest selling game ever. As a serious gamer that must feel great, no?\n\nBeing a big video game collector, its crazy to have that under my belt… definitely a big deal.\n\nYou also score (shows) for Cartoon Network?\n\nYeah I do. Cartoon Network, Adult Swim, HBO, CBS, Fox. I can say the bulk of my time goes to scoring TV shows, commercials, video games and documentaries. In fact, I just finished working on a documentary with director David Paul Meyer about a great comedian Trevor Noah called You Laugh But It’s True.\n\nHow did you meet Prince Po?\n\nI met prince Po about 8 years ago while he was working with Madlib doing a song on the Percee P album (Perserverance). I started sending beats and he started calling me and spitting over the phone. It was crazy like where have you been? Let’s work! We were doing songs off and on, just seeing where it took us.\n\nI was juggling Alchemist projects and Prince Po tracks, on top of scoring, so it took a while to really get this finished. But it’s finally coming out. It’s all very next level stuff.\n\nWhat does the title Animal Serum mean to you?\n\nFor me, I feel like it’s animal blood, you know, drinking the blood of an animal. We’re really trying to regenerate that rawness. The way he’s coming at it with the lyrics is so intense. There’s a LOT of true lyricism, and that’s what we’re bringing back. That raw animal essence.\n\nIn the exclusive audio clip below, Oh No shares some Dilla memories with me.",

If his recent release is any indication of what's to come, we're in for a revival of that 90's nostalgia.\n\nHis latest release NehruvianDOOM is a collaboration with the often illusion – always dope – MF DOOM. The 9 tracks gem, which is available on vinyl if you're vinyl head, is a pleasure to listen to. Insightful lyrics, slamming beats and an overall vibe that takes us back. Tracks like Mean The Most and Caskets will have you (figuratively) wearing out your rewind button. MF DOOM's production, we should note, is also top-notch – less of a departure than JJ DOOM may have been for some heads – plus new DOOM bars are ALWAYS coveted.\n\nIt's easy to see what Nas was thinking with this one.

    "title": "Uptown Hit: The Kurious Interview",
    "content": "1994 was a crazy year in hip-hop. It was the year that Nas dropped his classic, and arguably genre defining, masterpiece. It was, for all intensive purposes, the height of the golden era – and east coast had that shit on lock. \n\nEnter Kurious (representing uptown), one of the most well known Latino artists on the NYC scene at the time. After getting involved with Bobbito and (Prime Minister) Pete Nice‘s Hoppoh imprint, he released his first single in 1992. With the duos help he secured himself a deal and released his debut album in ’94 – on Columbia records –, which was released (and promoted) alongside Nas’s Illmatic. With critical acclaI'm and more than one single, Kurious seemed to be on the rise; however, it wasn’t until 2009 that he released an official follow-up – outside of a handful of memorable collaborations including a verse on MF DOOM’s?.\n\nWe were lucky enough to chat with Kurious himself. In part one of two he discusses his first album, his thoughts on being a pioneer and working with DOOM.\n\nIt’s that uptown shit. Check the interview after the jump\n\nHow did you first get involved in hip-hop?\n\nI first got involved with hip hop as a fan when I was 9yrs. old. I grew up on 97th and amsterdam in the height of break dance and graf, across the street from rocksteady park.\n\nHow did you originally get linked up with Bobbitto and Pete Nice?\n\nI grew up in the same building as Bobbito and he worked at Def Jam and got me a little gig when i finished high school and introduced me to Pete Nice.\n\nYour first album was a classic…period! It was released on Columbia at the same time as Illmatic (I remember seeing the double ads in the source). Can you talk a bit about this period? On a personal level did you feel any competition with Nas?\n\nIt was an interesting period and everything was moving fast, I was a kid and very immature but having a lot of fun. I never felt a drop of competition with Nas, me and my friends admired what he was doing and I was just doing what came natural to me. Nas was always cool,really smart and beyond his years.\n\nWhat was the process like recording your album? Who did you work with? What was your personal fave cut?\n\nThat album was a big party. Every session was flooded with homeboys and a lot of intoxicants. I worked with Stimulated Dummies, Beatnuts, Bosco Money and Pete Nice and Richie Rich. I guess my favorite song was I’m Kurious maybe but I really don’t like listening to it (the album) much. I think I was in a place of mass turmoil but having genuine fun in those days but I wish I was capable of taking things more seriously. I’m glad that some folks consider it a classic though.\n\nDo you consider it a classic?\n\nI personally may not consider it classic but it definitely has a charm and that’s not up to me to decide anyway. I am really grateful for how that album affected certain people and I see the sincerity when they approach me.\n\nTough question…but many consider you a pioneer or legend. How do you feel about that? Do consider yourself a pioneer?\n\nI’m definitely a veteran but my path has been long and unpredictable. I am a musical artist of some sort that loves hip hop. I think I may be a legend probably in my own mind.\n\nWhat kept you from releasing a follow-up until 2009?\n\nI had to find myself and it took a while. I’m still learning but I was like yo I gotta release an album, it was haunting me. I had some guest spots here and there and some songs but thats it. I wasnt believing in myself enough or I was over thinking. You CANT overthink music. You are WAY better off underthinking.\n\nTell us what it’s like working with Doom. What is that creative process like?\n\nWorking with DOOM is great. He is a true artist. Down to earth, unnaffected and loves music but more importantly than that, we were great friends. The creative process with Doom is a sloppy perfection if you ask me. Smart dude and a kind dude, he’s special.

    "clean_content": "1994 was a crazy year in hip-hop. It was the year that Nas dropped his classic, and arguably genre defining, masterpiece. It was, for all intensive purposes, the height of the golden era – and east coast had that shit on lock. \n\nEnter Kurious (representing uptown), one of the most well known Latino artists on the NYC scene at the time. After getting involved with Bobbito and (Prime Minister) Pete Nice‘s Hoppoh imprint, he released his first single in 1992. With the duos help he secured himself a deal and released his debut album in ’94 – on Columbia records –, which was released (and promoted) alongside Nas’s Illmatic. With critical acclaI'm and more than one single, Kurious seemed to be on the rise; however, it wasn’t until 2009 that he released an official follow-up – outside of a handful of memorable collaborations including a verse on MF DOOM’s?.\n\nWe were lucky enough to chat with Kurious himself. In part one of two he discusses his first album, his thoughts on being a pioneer and working with DOOM.\n\nIt’s that uptown shit. Check the interview after the jump\n\nHow did you first get involved in hip-hop?\n\nI first got involved with hip hop as a fan when I was 9yrs. old. I grew up on 97th and amsterdam in the height of break dance and graf, across the street from rocksteady park.\n\nHow did you originally get linked up with Bobbitto and Pete Nice?\n\nI grew up in the same building as Bobbito and he worked at Def Jam and got me a little gig when i finished high school and introduced me to Pete Nice.\n\nYour first album was a classic…period! It was released on Columbia at the same time as Illmatic (I remember seeing the double ads in the source). Can you talk a bit about this period? On a personal level did you feel any competition with Nas?\n\nIt was an interesting period and everything was moving fast, I was a kid and very immature but having a lot of fun. I never felt a drop of competition with Nas, me and my friends admired what he was doing and I was just doing what came natural to me. Nas was always cool,really smart and beyond his years.\n\nWhat was the process like recording your album? Who did you work with? What was your personal fave cut?\n\nThat album was a big party. Every session was flooded with homeboys and a lot of intoxicants. I worked with Stimulated Dummies, Beatnuts, Bosco Money and Pete Nice and Richie Rich. I guess my favorite song was I’m Kurious maybe but I really don’t like listening to it (the album) much. I think I was in a place of mass turmoil but having genuine fun in those days but I wish I was capable of taking things more seriously. I’m glad that some folks consider it a classic though.\n\nDo you consider it a classic?\n\nI personally may not consider it classic but it definitely has a charm and that’s not up to me to decide anyway. I am really grateful for how that album affected certain people and I see the sincerity when they approach me.\n\nTough question…but many consider you a pioneer or legend. How do you feel about that? Do consider yourself a pioneer?\n\nI’m definitely a veteran but my path has been long and unpredictable. I am a musical artist of some sort that loves hip hop. I think I may be a legend probably in my own mind.\n\nWhat kept you from releasing a follow-up until 2009?\n\nI had to find myself and it took a while. I’m still learning but I was like yo I gotta release an album, it was haunting me. I had some guest spots here and there and some songs but thats it. I wasnt believing in myself enough or I was over thinking. You CANT overthink music. You are WAY better off underthinking.\n\nTell us what it’s like working with Doom. What is that creative process like?\n\nWorking with DOOM is great. He is a true artist. Down to earth, unnaffected and loves music but more importantly than that, we were great friends. The creative process with Doom is a sloppy perfection if you ask me. Smart dude and a kind dude, he’s special. He would make raw beats that always lean the right way and breathe and he always kept a notebook with him. During times when I was uninspired he would give me a spark.

To say he's highly respected by hip-heads worldwide would be an understatement; but forget everything you've heard from Mega thus far. This latest release Mega Philosophy is, well, incredible. It's introspective, it has incredible production (courtesy of Large Professor and is the most lyrical I think Mega's ever been. This album is a must listen for any hip-hip lover.\n\nStream it here\n\nHomeboy Sandman – Hallways\n\nIf you've been on Homeboy Sandman, well, sucks for you. He popped up on the scene in 2007 and has since released 5 studio albums – 2 of them on Peanut Butter Wolf's Stones Throw Imprint. I mean, he was named Best Hip-Hop Act in NYC 2008 by New York Press, which is a pretty heavy cosign. His latest album Hallways, which features the single Refugee, is a must listen. Amazing production (from Oh No and Jonwayne among others), and Sandman's signature melodic style make this an album worth plenty of burn.\n\nMayhem Lauren & Buckwild – Silk Pyramids\n\nMayhem Lauren, who many know as an Action Bronson affiliate, blessed us with an amazing example of NYC hip-hop. Founder member of the Smart Crew, who famously had a graffiti turf war with Banksy, teamed up with Buckwild to release Silk Pyramids – a 13 track true school beat down with no filler. If you're not familiar with Buckwild, he was part of the legendary DITC crew, and most notably produced Biggie's I Got A Story To Tell and Black Rob's Whoa – no big deal. The album features verses from Action Bronson and Troy Ave, amongst other. Bump this album immediately.\n\nStream Here\n\nSlimKid3 & DJ Nu-Mark – ‘Slimkid3 & DJ Nu-Mark’ LP\n\nArtist/Producer SlimKid3, part of the Pharcyde, and DJ Nu-Mark of Jurassic 5 fame, link up to bring 10 tracks full of dope cuts, smooth rhymes and soulful sample heavy 90's sounding hip-hop. Features such as Diamond D, Murs and J-Live help make this a solid listen cover to cover.",

This one is different though – the every sharp emcee changes things up and delivers five tracks of singing.

His debut album on Perspective Records,, featured production by Ski Beatz, KRS-One and Twista with appearances by Lauryn Hill, Busta Rhymes, and KRS-One. So what went wrong? Well, back when the Source had mad integrity – and pretty much ran the magazine game – they gave Young Zee a less-than-glowing review. In fact, that's putting it mildly, they basically tore the album up so bad that the label eventually decided to shelve the project; however, the album is actually ridiculously dope. Tracks like Stay Gold featuring Lauren Hill and Electric Chair feat Pace Won are must listens! \n\nCuban Link\n\nBig Pun is a legend, no argument. When he started out, he was in a crew called Full Of Clips with partners in rhyme Cuban Link and Triple Seis. Obviously Pun stuck out, but Cuban was his right hand, and was a part of many projects. Being part of the Terror Squad eventually led to a solo project entitled Still Tellin' Lies featuring Tony Sunshine, which actually faired quite well.

She's been heard on major radio and was even recognized by Source Magazine in their coveted Unsigned Hype column. Check out our interview with Ms. Saki Bomb after the jump.\n\nWhat's good? Tell everyone who you are and where you’re from?\n \nWhats Upppp it’s your girl Saki Bomb bka Young Nik! Im from Fort Greene, Brooklyn, by way of Japan...I'll explain that later. \n \nHow long have you been in this Hip-Hop game?\n \nSince 2008 when I dropped my video for \"Bouncers\".\n \nWhat was your first exposure to Hip-Hop?\n \nI would say the Lil Kim/Foxy Brown era hit me the hardest. Biggie, Jay-Z...I'm from Brooklyn so you already know.\n \nWho has influenced you? \n \nJames Brown, Lauren Hill, Lil KI'm, Foxxy Brown, Queen Latifah, Biggie, Jay-Z, Limp Bizkit, Linkin' Park and my family, because my cousin wrote my first rap. We would have the karaoke machine going and dubbing tapes. Damn! Fun times!\n \nDefine your style?\n \nI call it “Hipclectic” because I sound like everything in one; Hip-Hop, R&B and Pop. \nIt can be so diverse. I had to make up a new genre.\n \nWhat challenges do you face being a female MC? \n \nI would say breaking away from stereotypes that plague female Hip-Hop artists. For example, females that slept their way to the top versus females with actual talent, grinding for their own respect for their craft. Also companies thinking females are too emotional. I mean, I am emotional, but I put it in my music not my business. I’m worth the risk! \n \nBeing from NYC, do you feel the road is even more difficult as opposed to other Femcees from other regions? \n \nOf course, Hip-Hop originated from NYC so they set higher standards in this part of town. Not that I can't reach, but it’s easier for people from other places to be easily accepted, just by saying they're different (without necessarily being good). I like competition though. I usually feel I have none because I do me. I don't follow others. I create trends, I don't follow them. \n \nWhere are some places you've performed at? \n \nAramachi Lounge, SOB's, Times Square (100,000 people outside), Speed, 5Spot, Boston Concert Venue, Philly, Rose Castle…so many places. \n \nWhat are your Top 3 Hip-Hop albums of all time?\n \nReasonable Doubt, Miseducation of Lauren Hill and (Lil' Kim's) Hardcore. Oh and Foxy Brown's Broken Silence... I couldn't pIck just 3! \n \nWhat are your most memorable accomplishments to date? \n \nUnsigned Hype in Source Magazine, Independent Artist in Source Magazine, Future Female in Straight Stuntin' Magazine, my jingle playing on Ms. Jones morning show on Hot 97 for a year straight and winning the ILLMIND rhyme challenge in Brooklyn (Trophy). \n \nWhat advice would you give to young Femcees? \n \nStay true to yourself and do music that makes you feel good. This game isn't for the faint of heart. You have to be strong and always continue leaning. You have to be able to handle people's opinions. But, always stay open minded. \n \nWhat can we be expect from Young Nik going into 2015? \n \nYou can expect Young Nik to be Saki Bomb!",

If he's not on your list of best artists you're just being a hater; although he can come off kind of hocky at times, he pretty much earns a pass. His latest release Shady XV is a compilation that showcases his re-energized Shady Records. It's a good look for hip-hop, and we'll explain why in a minute. Let's talk about the tracks.\n\nThe album starts off with a barrage of bars from SlI'm himself on the self-produced title track, which sets the tone. Stand-outs from there include Vegas (by Bad Meets Evil), which features the overhyped Iggy Azalea rape jokes (ha?), Slaughterhouse's Y'all Know Me produced by Primo and the Just Blaze/Boy 1da produced Psychopathic Killer. Em's self-produced Right For Me and Fine Line are also good listens. In all the project features Kobe, Slaughterhouse, Yelawolf, Skylar Gray and anyone from the D that matters.\n\nNow why is this album a good look for hip-hop? It's cover to cover bars. It seems like good old fashioned skills are slowly taking the main stage again in hip-hop – and like any \"corporation\" it needs to start from the top down. Instead of signing gimmicky \"hype\" artists, Em seems to be rolling with spitters (like them or not). D12 kind of gets a pass, but everyone else here has bars.\n\nThe album closes with the Static Selektah produced Detroit vs Everyone, which (again) we predict will be a thing once other cities drop replies. Disc 2 is all old joints, we skipped that.\n\nIt's now out everywhere – stream it here.",

The Far Rockaway rapper has been making some real noise since the 2010 release of his DJ Khaled and DJ Ill Will hosted mixtape Far Rockaway's Most Wanted. As he prepares the release of his upcoming Cool 2 and inevitable tour for Young Rollin Stonerz, Boogz took a few minutes out to chat with AAHIPHOP. Peep the interview after the jump!\n\nHow did you get into hip-hop?\n\nWell, I got into the it watching my older brother (Un Pacino) who was doing his rap thing, so being around hI'm in the studio, and being in school battling people. That's what molded me. I was always into rapping, but it wasn't until I started to get exposed to big names in the studio with my brother – like Prodigy and Juelz Santana – that I actually began to take it seriously.\n\nHow did you connect with P initially?\n\nWell, as I mentioned, my brother Un worked with Prodigy [editor note: he was a close affiliate of the Infamous Mobb]. He released an album with hI'm a few years ago (Product Of The 80's). So I was always around the studio during that time. Prodigy took a liking to me – I was a skateboarder, and he could see that I had a certain swag about me. He could see I wasn't like all these other dudes spitting. I had bars. So he started rapping with me. We’ve been collaborating ever since.\n\nLet's talk about this latest project \"Young Rollin' Stonerz\" – what was the process of putting this album together?\n\nWe wanted to make a record that listeners could ride out to. Something to uplift. We wanted it to be an extremely laid back vibe – you know smoke a blunt, drink some champagne and zone out to the music. Classy, classic music.\n\nWhat was the recording process?\n\nAll the records we did, we did in the studio together. We would just go through beats – he'd bring beats to the table, and I'd bring some to the table. From there we'd just lay down tracks.\n\nDo you guys have lots of stash tracks?\n\nYeah, we got a lot of stash tracks [laughs].\n\nWell, the album is dope...\n\nWhat was your fave track?\n\nPersonally? I like Pass Me.\n\nThat track almost didn't make it on the album. Prodigy wasn't feeling it that much; he didn't like the hook I'd done. He wanted to keep a street feel and thought the song was a little outside of the vibe he was going for. I liked it – it has a commercial sound. It sounds like a song about a girl, but it's a song about life. P eventually agreed and let me put it on there.\n\nDid you guys have any other disagreements about what songs to include?\n\nWe had a few, but that's only natural. We both want the best product possible.\n\nI also really love 40oz.\n\nOh, 40oz is joint! [laughs] That joint was originally supposed to be me and Chinx Drugz, but we ended up using it for this project\n\nAre you guys going to tour the album at all?\n\nWe're currently doing one now – it's the Infamous tour, though. We're supposed to have our tour around January I think\n\nDo you have any other projects out right now?\n\nYeah, my latests projects Cool and American Fly are available now, and I have Cool 2 coming soon – that project has names like Fat Trel, Smoke Dza and Vado on it (to name a few).\n\nAny last words? \n\nLook out for the whole YR roster, look out for the entire Infamous Records, shout out my homie Swag and my crew up in Canada.

    "content": "This isn't the Fredro Starr you remember — not exactly. Over Audible Doctors production the rambunctious Onyx frontman delivers a smooth, mellow flow as he reps the Lo-Life lifestyle. The single, Polo Wars, is the third off of his Audible Doctor produced Made In The Streets. Check the visuals after the jump.\n\nAudible Doctor, a member of the Brooklyn based producer/rapper collective The Brown Bag All-Stars, was recently tapped to work with the likes of Jay-Z and Jay Electronica. His production style lends well to Fredro's flow – which is better than ever. It's been almost a decade since he released his last solo project.\n\nThe video sheds some light on the prominence of the iconic Ralph Lauren Polo Sport brand within the urban community –specifically within the NYC scene.

Check the visuals after the jump.\n\nAudible Doctor, a member of the Brooklyn based producer/rapper collective The Brown Bag All-Stars, was recently tapped to work with the likes of Jay-Z and Jay Electronica. His production style lends well to Fredro's flow – which is better than ever. It's been almost a decade since he released his last solo project.\n\nThe video sheds some light on the prominence of the iconic Ralph Lauren Polo Sport brand within the urban community –specifically within the NYC scene.

    "title": "Interview With Joe Clair",
    "content": "From 1994 — 1999 comedian Joe Clair, and co-host Big Les, brought us the best in hip-hop culture on BET's Rap City. We recently chatted with Joe, who shared some stories, fond memories of Rap City, his thoughts on 106th & Park going off the air and his mixtape. Be sure to follow Joe on Twitter for all his updates and show dates. Interview after the jump.\n\nHow did you get involved with BET?\n\nI had just graduated from college, and I felt like there was space for an educated, sort of collegiate voice in hip-hop, and I thought that I could be him. I was living in DC at the time – the BET headquarters wasn't not too far from where I lived, so I picked up the phone, called 411, got the number and started calling these guys on a regular basis. I was leaving messages for the producer on his answering machine. I called this guy for about, maybe ten months to a year – I can't remember correctly – but it was about that long.\n\nIn the interim, one of the associate producers saw me perform, and a month later after he saw me perform, a friend of mine was going to DJ on'Rap City', but they didn't have a place to shoot – so I asked them, \" Why don't you come to my house and shoot?\" The next day,'Rap City' came to my house.\n\n[chuckles] -- That's an amazing story\n\nYeah man, that's how I felt. You could imagine it happening to you. That's how I felt. When they showed up the associate producer was like, \"man, what's your name?\" I told hI'm \"Joe Clair.\" He asked, \"you're a comedian, right?\" I was like \"yeah.\" He said he saw me open for Paul Mooney and thought I was hilarious. He said maybe we could do some things together. A couple of minutes later, in walks the guy I was looking for – who I'd been calling – and the rest is history, so to speak.\n\nWhat were some of your best memories of being on'Rap City’? \n\nBest memories – man it's hard to pinpoint. Imagine being in your twenties, and single, and a comedian. So I'm touring and I'm doing all the comedy stuff, and I'm on television five days a week, interviewing rappers. I want to say the whole thing was my best memory of'Rap City', you know what I mean? But some of the outstanding moments would be...the realization that I got one of the final interviews that Biggie gave or that I was sitting and smoking a blunt with Tupac while he played the Makavelli album before it came out.\n\nIn the audio clip below Joe shared with another memory – meeting RakI'm for the first time at the Greatest Day In Hip-Hop History cover shoot.\n\nSmoking a blunt with Biggie – days before he died – was mind-blowing'Rap City' literally went from being in the streets, to becoming a more structured, \"polished\" production. What's your take on the evolution it took?\n\nAt that time, it took on the eventual life that we had been dreading from the start and that's when the powers that be, that didn't have a real foot in the culture, got their hands on it. It was going to be exploited, and – not to say that I'm mad at that – I wasn't looking forward to that if it meant the playing down of some of the authenticity, some of the intelligence, some of the stuff that actually made it a culture. Playing down of the other aspects of hip hop that didn't generate money so much, but made it what hip hop was. They forgot about breakdancing, and they forgot about graffiti – they forgot about all that. We live in a capitalistic society so of course I suppose this had to happen but at the expense of what? Well, now we can look back and see what the expense was.\n\nTell me about your album 20 Years Too Late.\n\nI've done a lot of things since'Rap City', man. You just keep going; you know what I mean? I got into entertainment as a comedian, and I got into media through my love of hip hop. But from that, I've got a complete knowledge of how the entertainment industry operates – what works, what doesn't work and a lot of life lessons along the way. The album that you just talked about, or the mixtape as I like to call it, was a culmination of where I had been, and I thought that now was the time for a voice that didn't sound like all of the other voices. I feel like that project was a precursor to something bigger for me. I don’t know exactly what that'bigger' is yet. You know in life things play themselves out all the time, so look forward to hearing my voice in some way real soon. And either with a bigger message or with more wattage, so to speak, you know what I mean?\n\nIn the clip below, Joe shares his thoughts on 106th & Park going off the air.\n\nListen to Joe Clair's 20 Years Too Late here.\n\n— Riley Wallace",

    "content": "The Wu-Tang Clan is legendary, no argument there. The argument does arise when we’re discussing who are your fave spitters from the (originally) nine-man Staten-Island outfit. Method Man, regardless of solo-success always seems to get a pass and Chef is universally accepted as one of its greats – but I think it’s impossible to not praise GFK for his innovation and sheer work ethic. He recently blessed us with his 10th solo effort 36 Seasons, a gorgeous conceptual album released on Tommy Boy Records.\n\nConceptual albums are no small feat – and few have really done the format as much justice as Price Paul and Raekwon; although, GFK does a great job weaving a lyrically strong story that follows his return home after a nine year prison sentence. He finds it hard to stay away from the game (especially after learning his girl has ) and returns to a life of crime only to be set-up. The story, which plays out over 14 songs features a supporting cast of characters played by AZ, Kool G Rap, Tre Williams, Pharoahe Monch, Rell, Kadence Springs, Shawn Wigs and The Revelations.\n\nStandouts for us were Emergency Procedure, which sees Ghostface being saved after the botched heist by a Doctor played by Pharoahe Monch, and Blood In the Streets, which sees Ghostface out for vengeance against the man who double crossed hI'm (played by AZ). The one maybe'con' of this project, if you want to call it that, is that many of the songs seem wildly out of context outside of the album – which should be a better reason to give this a front to back spin.

Method Man, regardless of solo-success always seems to get a pass and Chef is universally accepted as one of its greats – but I think it’s impossible to not praise GFK for his innovation and sheer work ethic. He recently blessed us with his 10th solo effort 36 Seasons, a gorgeous conceptual album released on Tommy Boy Records.\n\nConceptual albums are no small feat – and few have really done the format as much justice as Price Paul and Raekwon; although, GFK does a great job weaving a lyrically strong story that follows his return home after a nine year prison sentence. He finds it hard to stay away from the game (especially after learning his girl has ) and returns to a life of crime only to be set-up. The story, which plays out over 14 songs features a supporting cast of characters played by AZ, Kool G Rap, Tre Williams, Pharoahe Monch, Rell, Kadence Springs, Shawn Wigs and The Revelations.\n\nStandouts for us were Emergency Procedure, which sees Ghostface being saved after the botched heist by a Doctor played by Pharoahe Monch, and Blood In the Streets, which sees Ghostface out for vengeance against the man who double crossed hI'm (played by AZ). The one maybe'con' of this project, if you want to call it that, is that many of the songs seem wildly out of context outside of the album – which should be a better reason to give this a front to back spin. It's also an inescapable by-product of this format.\n\nA playful mix of introspective soul and gritty hiphop, Ghostface’s 36 Seasons is all of the creativity and wordplay that we’ve come to expect from GFK – too bad we didn’t enjoy the A Better Tomorrow as much as this one!\n\nIt’s available now everywhere you can cop music – a MUST LISTEN.\n\nNote: This top 5 is solely that of Riley \"Special\" Wallace and doesn't explicitly reflect the view of all aboveaveragehiphop.com's staff and writers.",

I admit, I slept on hI'm for a while before delving in (pause). For those who are a fan of the young king – his latest 2014 Forest Hill Drive is a personal, poignent example of good hip-hop. Over 13 tracks, Cole eloquently rocks his heart on his sleeve and struts over subject matter that ranges from first (and various) sexual experiences to issues of race and self-worth.\n\nThe album is largely produced by Cole himself, with some exceptions –'03 Adolesence, Tale of 2 Cities and Love Truly were produced by Willie B., Vinylz and!llmind/Cardiak respectively. The other exceptions have Cole \"co-producing\", so he is extremely hands on (and it shows). From blasting white rappers on the banging Fire Squad, chasing dreams on the Mobb Deep sampled St. Tropez or flexing hindsight and regret on Apparently, Cole shows a lot of himself on this record – and his honesty is paying off.\n\nThe album has thus far been extremely well received by fans around the world, and with good reason. Cole is just a good dude. Whether he’s buying his mother’s foreclosed home (his childhood home), or visiting fans to personally play them his new record, Cole just seems like a good person – and it isn’t unnoticed by his core audience, who are propelling this latest project up the charts.\n\nIt's available everywhere now – A MUST LISTEN!\n\nNote: This top 5 is solely that of Riley \"Special\" Wallace and doesn't explicitly reflect the view of all aboveaveragehiphop.com's staff and writers.",

It's also, as of late, become the nucleus of the drill movement, which has been led by artists like Chief Keef, Lil' Herb and Lil' Durk. It's the definition of musical melting pot.\n\nEnter XVRHLDY (pronounced Xavier Holliday), the new face and sound of the Chicago music scene. With a vocal range that (sonically) makes us think of a young 3 Stacks (Andre 3000), Xavier is bringing a unique style/sound – and it's not going unnoticed. He was recently featured by big publications like The Source and XXL, and the list goes on. His highly anticipated Need To Know II: LUNA, dropping early 2015, will feature the likes of Pete Rock, Saba, NoName Gypsy, Joey Purp and Odd Couple, among others.\n\nWe took some time out to chat with Xavier (interview below).\n\nTell us about how you got into hip-hip\n\nI've been performing since I was young – my mother used to make me memorize long speeches, like 6 pages, and recite them in front of large crowds of people at church functions. So I've always been comfortable in front of an audience.\n\nAs far as hip-hop goes, I actually didn't grow up listening to it. When I was younger, I was more more into punk rock – Panic At The Disco, Fall Out Boy, All American Rejects (etc). The first rap I ever really heard was Beastie Boys,. I actually had that on cassette tape. That's where it started for me, I started writing raps and poems and it grew from there.\n\nTell us about your music. Who are some of your influences?\n\nI don't like to really give influences, because I feel like I don't fashion myself to sound like anybody – but in terms of the actual sound of my voice, I've been told I sound like André (3000) a lot, just as far as the southern drawl we both have. As far as actual influences, I pull most of my inspiration from my life and what I go through rather than from an artist. From my abstract thoughts.\n\n\u0017Walk us through your current projects.\n\nI have a few older projects, from before I was as serious as I am now, but I'd say my most important project to date has been my Need To Know EP.\n\nI originally wanted to make a whole album. I was living in NYC at the time and my circle there (including my producer), after hearing the sounds I was making, told me not to waste them. Rather, that I should release them properly – hence the EP. That was really something that I released to hold my fans over while I fine tune the album. Crazy thing about that project is that it was written and recorded in 3 weeks, but it doesn't at all sound rushed.\n\nRight now your getting a lot of attention from the industry. How does that feel?\n\nIt really inspires me to keep going. People don't always get to see the work you put in you know? It's like studying for school finals; nobody really sees the effort you put in at home, just the overall performance in the exam. It's inspiring that people are noticing what my vision is and what I've been working on. It feels hella good, and I'm going to just keep pushing.\n\nIn the audio clip below, XZVHLDY gives us his take on the current Chicago music scene and the influence of the Chi-Town sound.\n\nWhat are you working on now? Do you have an album coming?\n\nI actually have two projects coming soon. One is a shorter project, which is actually a sequel to Need To Know –Need To Know II: LUNA –that's actually finished now. It's just being mixed. I plan on dropping another video before that too. As well, l'm working on making sure the album sounds the way I want it to sound. That should be out in the summer.\n\nWe're looking forward to that! Any last words for our blog?\n\nI appreciate you interviewing me! I'm in a particularly good mood today, I'm at Starbucks drinking the white cocoa – and I love the white cocoa!

    "title": "Meet Chris Rivers, Son Of The Late Great Big Pun",
    "content": "Like father like son – it's impossible not to recall this saying when listening to the young rapper Chris Rivers from the Bronx. Chris is the son of the Latin multiple-syllable legend Big Pun, who rose to (platinum) prominence in the 90's as a member of the Terror Squad. Far from the only child-of-a-rapper out there nowadays (i.e Eazy E's son, Run's kids and even the son of the late ODB), Chris sets himself apart from the pack by striving to create a personal brand that falls outside the shadow of his father's enormous (no pun intended) legacy. He's a humble kid who'd been putting in an incredible amount of work, and it shows in the most important place  – his music. Check out our interview with Chris Rivers after the jump.\n\nIntroduce yourself to the people\n\nWhat’s good people? My name is Chris Rivers, and I’m the son of the late great Big Pun. I’m an artist from the Bronx (the dragon).\n\nTell me a bit about your background and how you got into Hip-Hop.\n\nObviously being the son of someone who was so heavily involved in the scene, I was always around it as a child. I grew up in studios – but, I mean, he died when I was six, and I wasn’t involved (in music) at that point. However, like any child who grew up without a parent will tell you, music fills a void. I was always influenced by it, and it's always been a part of my life. I’ve always been naturally talented with words and writing and after high-school, about 3-4 years ago, I started to pursue this seriously. Thank goodness for the internet – I began releasing music/videos, and they just caught fire. I’ve come a long away but know I still have a long way to go.\n\nWho are some of your influences and top artists?\n\nBlack thought, Eminem, My Father, Mos Def, Lupe Fiasco – and newer artists like Kendrick Lamar and J. Cole. I like stuff with substance and lyrical content.\n\nTalk about your releases thus far.\n\nWonderland of Misery 1 & 2 are available now on DatPiff – and they are an embodiment of myself. I took my time on my music. You can hear my progression over those two tapes. If you want to get a sense of who I am as an artist, definitely get your hands on those. I also have the EP that we put on I-Tunes.\n\nDo you, or did you feel any pressure based on who your father is?\n\nI did feel more pressure when I first started – I mean my dad is a legend, and one of my fave rappers. Not just because he’s my dad, but because he’s legitimately one of the best to ever do it. I mean I’ll be on the street or on the bus (or whatever) and see people with tattoos of him, and they’ve never even met him. To be that iconic is really heavy. That being said, I knew that if I was going to do this, that I had to deliver at a certain caliber. I knew people would definitely hold me to that, so it’s a gift and a curse. It keeps me on my toes, and really motivated me to give my 100%. I’ve found that as I’ve grown though, I feel less and less pressure – as I become my own person and become more comfortable with my own identity on the mic.\n\nI think it’s admirable that you keep it so, for lack of a better term, 100 in your music. I mean on tracks like, and, you get extremely personal.\n\nThere is definitely a misconception about me – a lot of people think I came up rich or a certain way. It's crazy to see people debating on forums and comment sections with me about my life. I’ve just tried to keep my music as honest/real as possible.

    "clean_content": "Like father like son – it's impossible not to recall this saying when listening to the young rapper Chris Rivers from the Bronx. Chris is the son of the Latin multiple-syllable legend Big Pun, who rose to (platinum) prominence in the 90's as a member of the Terror Squad. Far from the only child-of-a-rapper out there nowadays (i.e Eazy E's son, Run's kids and even the son of the late ODB), Chris sets himself apart from the pack by striving to create a personal brand that falls outside the shadow of his father's enormous (no pun intended) legacy. He's a humble kid who'd been putting in an incredible amount of work, and it shows in the most important place  – his music. Check out our interview with Chris Rivers after the jump.\n\nIntroduce yourself to the people\n\nWhat’s good people? My name is Chris Rivers, and I’m the son of the late great Big Pun. I’m an artist from the Bronx (the dragon).\n\nTell me a bit about your background and how you got into Hip-Hop.\n\nObviously being the son of someone who was so heavily involved in the scene, I was always around it as a child. I grew up in studios – but, I mean, he died when I was six, and I wasn’t involved (in music) at that point. However, like any child who grew up without a parent will tell you, music fills a void. I was always influenced by it, and it's always been a part of my life. I’ve always been naturally talented with words and writing and after high-school, about 3-4 years ago, I started to pursue this seriously. Thank goodness for the internet – I began releasing music/videos, and they just caught fire. I’ve come a long away but know I still have a long way to go.\n\nWho are some of your influences and top artists?\n\nBlack thought, Eminem, My Father, Mos Def, Lupe Fiasco – and newer artists like Kendrick Lamar and J. Cole. I like stuff with substance and lyrical content.\n\nTalk about your releases thus far.\n\nWonderland of Misery 1 & 2 are available now on DatPiff – and they are an embodiment of myself. I took my time on my music. You can hear my progression over those two tapes. If you want to get a sense of who I am as an artist, definitely get your hands on those. I also have the EP that we put on I-Tunes.\n\nDo you, or did you feel any pressure based on who your father is?\n\nI did feel more pressure when I first started – I mean my dad is a legend, and one of my fave rappers. Not just because he’s my dad, but because he’s legitimately one of the best to ever do it. I mean I’ll be on the street or on the bus (or whatever) and see people with tattoos of him, and they’ve never even met him. To be that iconic is really heavy. That being said, I knew that if I was going to do this, that I had to deliver at a certain caliber. I knew people would definitely hold me to that, so it’s a gift and a curse. It keeps me on my toes, and really motivated me to give my 100%. I’ve found that as I’ve grown though, I feel less and less pressure – as I become my own person and become more comfortable with my own identity on the mic.\n\nI think it’s admirable that you keep it so, for lack of a better term, 100 in your music. I mean on tracks like, and, you get extremely personal.\n\nThere is definitely a misconception about me – a lot of people think I came up rich or a certain way. It's crazy to see people debating on forums and comment sections with me about my life. I’ve just tried to keep my music as honest/real as possible. I don’t want there to be a separation between the artist and the person. Everything I talk about has either happened to me or been witnessed by me – so when you listen to my records, you can know that you’re getting the true story.\n\nThere are a lot of cats around now who are children of famous artists.

    "content": "Last night when I made my way to my mailbox I had only one thing on my mind – Big Pun. A week earlier, after hitting up producer Domingo on Twitter, I was about to receive a USB key with a WAV version of his new Big Pun EP Bronx Legends Never Die, the first official (Rios family sanctioned) Big Pun release since 2000’s Yeah Baby.\n\nBeing Latin, everybody has their idols in Hip-Hop and it’s definitely not a biased thing but people idolized Biggie or they idolized Pac and people do idolize Pun but being that I’m Latin… Latin people hold Pun on this pedestal but I feel that his legacy doesn’t get pushed enough.\n\n- Domingo discussing his motivation for the EP (BREAL TV)\n\nThe EP had a limited CD release of only 350, which Domingo pre-sold as part of an indiegogo campaign. Unfortunately I missed the boat, but was excited that domingo was willing to ship a USB. After unpacking and booting up my PC I finally pressed play – wow! This isn’t an over-produced posthumous release that many legends have suffered, this is a raw, hip-hop project that Pun would be proud of.\n\nThe EP features remixes/reworks and a few new/unreleased tracks – namely From the X and the epic Lyrically Fit. the latter features not only Shaq, Cormega and Easy Mo Bee [wow...mind blown], but also Pun’s son Chris Rivers who comes in right after his father. Another big tune is Symphony 2000 featuring Kool G Rap, Truck Turner and KRS One. The remixes, as well, are ridiculous – you need Domingo’s Dream Shatterer remix in your life (trust me).\n\nThe EP also includes some production from the infamous Dr.G, who has produced for Wu-Tang, Kool G Rap and more – and Domingo (if you aren’t familiar) is a legend in his own right. You should cruise through his discography.\n\nProbably the most engaging (and touching) part of the EP are the memories that were shared by Pun fans. Domingo asked fans to be a part of this project and they supplied hI'm with drops via Facebook. This is (overall) a great listen – highly recommended for old and new fans alike. It will be available on I-Tunes January 18th. Go support great music!",

I was born in the early 80's, and I grew up in the 90's surrounded by what I consider to be the best of hip-hop as a genre – and I feel that it (for the most part) still is. With that in mind, I'll now proceed to finally weigh in on the whole Iggy vs the world conversation.\n\nIs she a deep thinker who makes the thoughtful, well-written brand of hip-hop I love? No. For that reason, I don't consume it. So much so, that it's almost unfair for me to analyze it. What we can say with certainty though, is that her fans buy it. They shower her with undying adoration, buy tickets to her shows and (violently) defend her honour 140 characters at a time. When is the last time you did any of that for your favourite artists?\nInstead of tweeting about how much you hate her [Iggy Azalea], perhaps you can tweet about the latest record by Skyzoo or D'Angelo?\n\nMusic is a business, which means it's a for profit outfit that enjoys generating return on investment. There was a time when artists we worship and consider architects were in expensive studios recording big budget projects, because that's what we wanted. That's right – we were actually going to stores and buying their shit, packing up their shows, etc. That all stopped though; albeit it was kind of gradual. Nowadays people love to scream about how hip-hop isn't real – but didn't purchase Sadat X's past release, or rush out to support that latest Craig G effort. You catch my drift? Hip-Hop changed, but so did it's core of paying customers.\n\nMy hypothesis is that we grew up – let's face it, nobody young is that upset about any of this. It's us real heads who watched hip-hop grow from nothing into a feared outcry from black America. We watched as the highest powers tried – and failed miserably – to silence hip-hop. We're the ones who are mad that the thing we loved is being perverted into this corporate behemoth that appears to be shutting us out. That isn't hip-hop though. There I said it. All that shit we're protesting is about as hip-hop as Vanilla Ice, MC Hammer, PM Dawn, etc. Wack hip-hop irregardless of race, has long sold millions and been awarded Grammys and AMAs.\n\nHip-Hop is a culture, and it still thrives (in its purest form) today – but it needs our help. Are you mad that corporate America (i.e a group of old white people with suits) is allowing (for the most part) talentless rich kids take over the thing you love? Why not support the hundreds of real artists out there? Why don't we all band together and support all the artists who are preserving the culture? Why don't we stop just sitting around and actually make a change? Hip-hop was born an underdog, so going against the machine really shouldn't be something that scares us.\n\nIn an attempt to round back, I'll say that Iggy Azalea is a cog in the machine. None of this is her fault. She is making music, and people are buying it – it's supply and demand and it's the way business works. TI is no worse than Akon, who brought us Lady Gaga and Usher, who brought us Bieber.

During the golden era of hip-hop, you either had access to a proper studio, or you recorded demo tapes in your closet. Either way, when played today, classic demo tapes provide an authentic sound and feel that is hard to replicate by digital means. Over the next few weeks we'll be exploring some of the dopest demos we've come across – from unreleased b-sides, original versions of classics to reference tracks and unearthed gems. Hold on to your hats kiddies, we're about to do some digging.\n\nA Tribe Called Quest\n\nAs pivotal members of the Native Tongues, and early affiliates of the Jungle Brothers, the squad, consisting of Q-Tip, Phife Dawg, Jerobe and Ali Shaheed Muhammed ushered in the jazzy sound that purists still run with today. If you haven't watched their movie,. Anyways, the demo below is a collection of snippets off their original demo tape – and it's glorious. It includes demos of classics like Description of a Fool, Left My Wallet In El Segundo and an unreleased track that we've never heard before.\n\nWu-Tang Clan\n\nWu-Tang is pretty much the most successful group of its kind – and they have the discography to prove it. Below is a copy of their original 1992 demo tape, which I'll disclaimer may only appeal to the real heads. If that sounds like you, this 28 demo is a treasure cove of amazing shit – from the demo version of Tearz to an alternate version of Bring The Ruckus. It also has some shit we hadn't heard before. Worth a listen for any fan of the clan.\n\nDMX\n\nThis one is interesting; it's a relic from the period in between early 90's Born Loser DMX, who was kind of meh, and the 1996 It's Dark And Hell Is Hot X, who we actually wish we could have back! DMX has definitely gone through his share of ups and pretty embarrassing downs, but it's impossible to deny how much we all enjoyed listening to his old shit. This is a joint that, from what we know, was recorded in'95 – and it holds up. Worth a spin.\n\nKanye West\n\nIn his own words, Kanye West is the most inspirational artist of our generation. Whether or not you agree, it's impossible to argue his success. He's definitely blessed us with a discography of songs (and beats) that make for a strong case. We've all heard the stories of how he was a rapper all along, and after much grinding, Dame Dash finally heard hI'm out – and the rest is history. This, from what we can figure, is the tape that he played for Dame and Jigga. He's far from transforming to full Yeezus yet at this point, but he still had bars and beats. Give it an ear.",

    "content": "What makes a great producer and/or mc? In my opinion, it's someone who loves/respects the culture and knows the history of it – and let's not forget they gotta be nice with it. J57 checks off all those boxes. A former Fat Beats NYC employee, J was mentored by DJ Premier and Marco Polo. A member of the Brown Bag All-Stars, he's quickly becoming a go-to producer and rhyme slinger. After listening to his latest release, the 2057 EP, I had to reach out to him.\n\nIn the interview below, he talks about how he connected with Brown Bag, DJ Premier's influence on his music, his upcoming projects and more.\n\nIntroduce yourself to our readers.\n\nI'm J57. I'm an emcee/producer originally from Long Island but been living in Brooklyn for the past nine years.\n\nYou're currently in Australia – can you share with us what you're doing there?\n\nI'm putting in studio work with Aussie heavy hitters like The Thundamentals, LMXEC, and more. I also found time to link up with the homies Joey Bada$$, CJ Fly and Statik Selektah to work on my solo album (where I rap over my beats).\n\nHow did you get involved in hip-hop? Who were some of your influences?\n\nI became a fan of hip hop at a very young age. But, I didn't''participate'' until 11th grade in high school when I started to freestyle and beatbox in ciphers at parties and high school, etc.\n\nYou've mentioned that DJ Premier is a mentor to you – how did you first meet him?\n\nI met hI'm when I worked at Fat Beats but became tight with hI'm while at SIRIUS/XM at \"Rap Is Outta Control\" when he would fill in for DJ Eclipse, when he was on tour.\n\nHow has he helped you develop as a producer?\n\nHe's helped my mentality as well as being able to see how he levels his beats on the mixing board; seeing how loud he puts the bass, the bass-kick, snare, hi-hat, etc. I would go home after a long session with hI'm and just imitate what he did level-wise for a long time and that really helped my sound for sure. What I mean by mentality is, I picked up on a lot of key words that he always used to describe producers he thought were dope, by calling them \"creative\" and stuff like that, so it made me want to push the envelope even more. His work ethic is unparalleled and his passion for making quality music, as well, so I learned a lot from hI'm in those departments, too, just from being in the same room with him.\n\nWhat's your relationship with Marco Polo?\n\nI met Marco 10 years ago at Fat Beats and became tight with hI'm right away. He always took me under his wing, which I'll always be grateful for. I used not to put basslines on my beats because I was awful and didn't understand how to put them in key. He noticed and took me to Marco Polo bassline camp about 5 or 6 years ago. He's the type of person that would give you the shirt off his back, if you're down with hI'm and has always given me his old records for samples, which has been such a great. To hear a sample he flipped and figured out how he flipped it.\n\nI would go home after a long session with hI'm (Dj Premier) and just imitate what he did level-wise... that really helped my sound...\n– J57\n\nYou're a member of the Brown Bag All-Stars – how did you get involved with them?\n\nWe started Brown Bag AllStars back in the summer of 2007. We were all friends that worked at Fat Beats / met at Fat Beats and decided to get in the lab one day and the rest is history.\n\nDo you ever find it difficult being both an MC and (extremely) active producer?\n\nIt was close to impossible to do both for a good 7 years; there were years where I just focused on making beats and rapping took a backseat. There were times where I wouldn't make beats and just focus on rhyming...but now I have it all figured out. I'm finally 50/50 and just as passionate about both...and loving it!\n\nOne of the projects you have coming up (that we're particularly excited about) is the Brown Bag x Pro Era collaboration project. Can you give us any details about it? What can we expect?\n\nThat album is the A La $OLE x J57 project. I first got in contact with A La a little over a year ago. He was on tour with the homie Joey Bada$$ and Joey was playing one of the joints I produced for hI'm while on their tour bus, so he wanted beats. I dug his rhymes, so we organically linked up and decided to do a project. It's just some dope beats and rhymes.

    "clean_content": "What makes a great producer and/or mc? In my opinion, it's someone who loves/respects the culture and knows the history of it – and let's not forget they gotta be nice with it. J57 checks off all those boxes. A former Fat Beats NYC employee, J was mentored by DJ Premier and Marco Polo. A member of the Brown Bag All-Stars, he's quickly becoming a go-to producer and rhyme slinger. After listening to his latest release, the 2057 EP, I had to reach out to him.\n\nIn the interview below, he talks about how he connected with Brown Bag, DJ Premier's influence on his music, his upcoming projects and more.\n\nIntroduce yourself to our readers.\n\nI'm J57. I'm an emcee/producer originally from Long Island but been living in Brooklyn for the past nine years.\n\nYou're currently in Australia – can you share with us what you're doing there?\n\nI'm putting in studio work with Aussie heavy hitters like The Thundamentals, LMXEC, and more. I also found time to link up with the homies Joey Bada$$, CJ Fly and Statik Selektah to work on my solo album (where I rap over my beats).\n\nHow did you get involved in hip-hop? Who were some of your influences?\n\nI became a fan of hip hop at a very young age. But, I didn't''participate'' until 11th grade in high school when I started to freestyle and beatbox in ciphers at parties and high school, etc.\n\nYou've mentioned that DJ Premier is a mentor to you – how did you first meet him?\n\nI met hI'm when I worked at Fat Beats but became tight with hI'm while at SIRIUS/XM at \"Rap Is Outta Control\" when he would fill in for DJ Eclipse, when he was on tour.\n\nHow has he helped you develop as a producer?\n\nHe's helped my mentality as well as being able to see how he levels his beats on the mixing board; seeing how loud he puts the bass, the bass-kick, snare, hi-hat, etc. I would go home after a long session with hI'm and just imitate what he did level-wise for a long time and that really helped my sound for sure. What I mean by mentality is, I picked up on a lot of key words that he always used to describe producers he thought were dope, by calling them \"creative\" and stuff like that, so it made me want to push the envelope even more. His work ethic is unparalleled and his passion for making quality music, as well, so I learned a lot from hI'm in those departments, too, just from being in the same room with him.\n\nWhat's your relationship with Marco Polo?\n\nI met Marco 10 years ago at Fat Beats and became tight with hI'm right away. He always took me under his wing, which I'll always be grateful for. I used not to put basslines on my beats because I was awful and didn't understand how to put them in key. He noticed and took me to Marco Polo bassline camp about 5 or 6 years ago. He's the type of person that would give you the shirt off his back, if you're down with hI'm and has always given me his old records for samples, which has been such a great. To hear a sample he flipped and figured out how he flipped it.\n\nI would go home after a long session with hI'm (Dj Premier) and just imitate what he did level-wise... that really helped my sound...\n– J57\n\nYou're a member of the Brown Bag All-Stars – how did you get involved with them?\n\nWe started Brown Bag AllStars back in the summer of 2007. We were all friends that worked at Fat Beats / met at Fat Beats and decided to get in the lab one day and the rest is history.\n\nDo you ever find it difficult being both an MC and (extremely) active producer?\n\nIt was close to impossible to do both for a good 7 years; there were years where I just focused on making beats and rapping took a backseat. There were times where I wouldn't make beats and just focus on rhyming...but now I have it all figured out. I'm finally 50/50 and just as passionate about both...and loving it!\n\nOne of the projects you have coming up (that we're particularly excited about) is the Brown Bag x Pro Era collaboration project. Can you give us any details about it? What can we expect?\n\nThat album is the A La $OLE x J57 project. I first got in contact with A La a little over a year ago. He was on tour with the homie Joey Bada$$ and Joey was playing one of the joints I produced for hI'm while on their tour bus, so he wanted beats. I dug his rhymes, so we organically linked up and decided to do a project. It's just some dope beats and rhymes. We're very like-minded as people and we're both as hungry as you can be, so expect us both to bring our \"A Game.\"\n\nYou also have an upcoming record with one my fave artists, Homeboy Sandman. What can you tell me about that project? How did you connect him?\n\nWe're almost finished with our EP, and it's fucking dope.

    "content": "Hip-Hop Twitter was a buzz this weekend over a rant that Hot 97 DJ Funkmaster Flex unleashed upon Jay-Z and his Life + Times web team/writers. His beef arose when a rep from Life + Times, who flex alleges had previously stolen ideas from his mobile app after an interview, emailed to ask for his involvement in the Dipset reunion – Flex took issue, as did the Dipset. What followed was a lot of stuff that will be hard to take back and a promptly released, sub-par, and frankly immature.\n\nHowever, this is far from the first time that Funkmaster Flex, who got his start DJing the infamous Tunnel Nightclub, has used his status and platform to air grievances. Below I've compiled some of his most uncomfortable moments.\n“Don’t play with me man, don’t play with me...play me like I’m stupid, you’re going to see a different dude firing off on you. On you.”\n\n– Funkmaster Flex\n\nFlex vs Mr. Cee Haters\n\nWhen the legendary Mr. Cee, who is credited with helping discover an up and coming rapper named Biggie Smalls (no big deal), was arrested for soliciting a male prostitute, many fans were quick to denounce him. Flex, his longtime friend, came to his defence with a. It started with a we don't discriminate warning and ended with Flex all but assuring Cee's innocence and aiming crosshairs at Power 105. Cee has since come (partially), and left the station.\n\nFlex vs Nicki Minaj\n\nAfter Peter Rosenberg announced that Nicki Minaj was not real hip-hop live during Summer Jam, the hip-hop/pop diva was instructed by the YMCMB capo (Lil' Wayne) not to hit the stage – and she complied. Flex's response to the situation was to air her out on every platform he could. This escalated to a very tense (and kind of epic) Flex vs Nas Steph Lova\n\nDuring an interview with Steph Lova, Nas, who is one of the most prolific lyricists of our generation, accused Flex of accepting payola to play records. If you're not familiar, this means Flex was breaking the first rule of radio and accepting bribes to play records that may not otherwise make it to air – not completely unbelievable, and highly illegal. What should have been a war of words with Esco himself turned into an assault charge as Flex confronted and laid hands on Steph Lova the next day.\n\nFlex vs 2Pac Fans\n\nThere is one thing that hip-hop fans, depending on their personal taste, can never agree on: Biggie vs Tupac. So it's understandable that Flex rubbed some heads the wrong way (pause) when he proclaimed live on stage that he didn't feel as though he needed to suck and/or ride 2Pac's penis like most fans – rather, as a New Yorker his horse in the race was the late Biggie Smalls. Wow, just wow..\n\nMoral of the story is that Flex is opinionated and really has zero fucks to give about your opinion.

While a lot of heads were busy checking for the new Lupe and Joey Bada$$ albums, I was checking for my pre-order of that new Sadat X album. Was it worth the wait? In short, yes. The aptly titled Never Left, which is X's 10 solo album, serves as a salute to the city of New York, a pound to real heads and a testament to his 25 year legacy.\n\nThe album kicks off with We In New York City, an ode to his hometown. If you've never been there this track may not appeal you, but that's ok. It's not really for you. For some of you instantly alienated listeners the album actually begins with track 3, I Know This Game, where Sadat X puts the game on blast, and discusses the state of the industry, namely the degradation of the power that record labels once held.\n\"I know some A&R's that now wash cars, they decided rap stars when they was in power...\nSony fired everybody, everybody sour...now rap moguls gotta blend with the locals...\"\nSadat X\n\nAs we continue along, we come to What Up Kid, which is essentially cautionary words of advice to the younger generation – much like Slick Rick's Hey Young World. This is one of the more serious notes on the album, as is Ya Live & Ya Learn, which sees X discussing his past legal and marital issues: \"...when I went o jail I lost my wife...on that particular day I had the gun, wasn't plannin' on killing no one, I had a street beef...\"\n\nAre there features, yes! Are they crutches? Nope. They are prefect compliments to the vibe. The album (most notably to me) has 16's from Black Rob (Get Yours), west coast legend King T (Sliddin'), Blacksheep/Evitan's Dres (Get Right) and Cormega on the already released single On Fire. Also, one of my fave moments on the album, Ain't Nothin Funny, features Craig G and Skyzoo.\n\nThe only misstep for me was the Fokus, Nasty Ness and Chi Ali assisted Put It On Me. I found the reggae flow really out of place on this album.\n\nOverall it's an amazing listen. A great addition was the mini story/interludes where he talks about his first show, his legendary session with B.I.G, meeting Jay-Z, seeing Nas at his shows and his relationship with 2Pac. Aside from giving rap nerds something to talk about, they really help illustrate the influence and respect Sadat has amongst his peers in the music racket.\n\nThe album ends with the title cut, which is fitting.

It could be that once they had money they could afford better production to spruce the track up. It could be a matter of sample clearance, like Kanye's All Falls Down that originally featured a Lauren Hill sample; however, more often than not, the original just wasn't hitting, so once signed, the label took the steps necessary to make the track sound its best. This week we look at three originals and judge for ourselves.\n\nCamp-Lo - Coolie High\n\nCamp-Lo's Uptown Saturday Night was a sleeper hit – a musical cult-classic of you will. Led by the infamous single Luchini, the duo came out the gate with a classic. Unfortunately (from a commercial standpoint) the duo faded fast, and although they've released music since, they never again reached Luchini heights. The song Coolie High was considered by many to be one of the dopest tracks on the album, and had they somehow gotten away with the sample of the original, they would have made a larger impact in my opinion. Take a listen for yourself.\n\nArtifacts - Wrong Side Of The Tracks\n\nNewark's own Artifacts, the duo of El Da Sensei and Tame One, have one of the dopest hip-hop classics ever – in fact it's one of my top 10 tracks ever in music. The demo version, however, is a whole different beast. It has a slight funk to it, and the infamous hook is sang by Brand Nubian rapper (and Vlad TV staple) Lord Jamar. We think they made the right choice in the end. Take a listen to the demo version for yourself.\n\nPete Rock CL Smooth - T.R.O.Y \n\nThis is it folks, possibly the greatest sample ever in hip-hop! Tom Scott's Today – better known as the sexy sax Pete Rock flipped in his landmark record T.R.O.Y. The track made CL Smooth a star and certified Pete Rock's place in the production game. The original though, didn't have quite the same spice...take a listen for yourself!\n\nNext week we'll continue to explore some classic demos! Keep diggin'!",

Timberland boot-wearing urban icons smoking blunt warps were nothing more than walking billboards for brands scheming to reach a demographic they likely understood better than we perceived they did. \n\nOh well!\n\nThat's business though, and the more things change, the more they stay the same. Check out a playlist of some of the best St.Ides joints – we recommend the Wh-Tang Clan one, the beat is crazy dope!",

    "content": "20 years ago, The Source Magazine's Nicholas Poluhoff proclaimed Chef Raekwon's debut album one of the best rap LPs of the year (if not ever). 20 years later and, much like the music itself, that review still holds truth. Only Built 4 Cuban Linx (OBFCL), the third solo effort to drop from the mighty WU-Tang Clan, is rightfully harolded by many as the quintessential street hip-hop album.\n\nAlthough it initially failed to commercially match the success of the group debut, Meth's Tical and ODB's Return To The 36 Chambers, it's definitely stood the test of time – much in the same fashion that Illmatic has [note: it has long since been certified as platinum]. I defy you to not get open when you hear Ice Cream, because twenty years later it still knocks harder than 80% of the joints out there.\n\n\"What truly sets Cuban Linx apart is the abundance of well-written complex lyrics. The end result is one of the best rap LPs of the year (if not ever)...\"\n\n–Nicholas Poluhoff, Source Magazine (1995)\n\n[4.5 Mics]\n\nMore importantly, Cuban Linx has inspired a generation of emcees (myself included) and producers. The album's narrative, lyricism, beats, features and even artwork were almost godly, and raised an outlandish bar of perfection that even Chef himself has never truly been able to surmount; although, OBFCL 2 was an amazing effort. It's a timeless artifact that takes listeners on a walk through the (dirty) streets of NYC circa 1995 – we're talking crime, Lo Snow Beach jackets, Tommy Hill, Clarks and blunts. \n\nIn celebration of the album's upcoming 20 year anniversary this summer, Rae and Ghost announced an upcoming documentary called The Purple Tape Files. The trailer, which debuted this past weekend at Sundance, is an exciting look at what appears to be a candid recount of the making of the classic. Hip-hop nerds, let's collectively rejoice.\n\nWe asked our Twitter followers if the album had inspired them in their lives/careers, and here's what some of them had to say:\n\n#onlybuiltforcubanlinx Helped me assimilate my style as an artist.\n– @DrkSideFlow\n\nTold Rea days ago! This album was our Theme music in the 90's!!! A major reason why the Crown came back to NYC!\n– @1KING_1CROWN\n\nCuban Linx's a soundtrack to my life as an inner city kid. It was Walkman food.

    "content": "I get a lot of mixes from DJs in my inbox – like lots! Every once and a while though, you hear something that stands out from the pack. That's what happened last Friday afternoon when I came across an insane mix of Camp Lo's Luchini blended with Bobby Shmurda's Hot Nigga. I dug deeper into the catalogue of James \"Biko\" Gates aka Nappy DJ Needles – the creator of the blend – and discovered a ton of dope material. He's definitely worth checking out.\n\nGet to know a little more about Nappy DJ Needles in the interview below.\n\nIntroduce yourself.\n\nI'm Nappy DJ Needles from St. Louis.\n\nHow did you get into DJing?\n\nI was asked by my brother to do a birthday party for one of his friends back in 1994. All I had was tapes and a few cds to play out of a boombox but I made it work. The response I got from playing my personal selections was infectious so I kept at it. During that time I was always shook that some kid was gonna call me out for not being a \"real\" dj since I was only working with tapes, so before that ever happend, after a few years, I got a cheap mixer and mis-matched turntables and learned to mix records. In 1998, I deejayed live with vinyl for the first time and it's been on ever since.\n\nWho were some of your influences?\n\nMy influences include Jazzy Jeff, Rich Medina, G-Wiz, DJ Alejan and Kid Capri.\n\nVinyl or Serato?\n\nBoth, but I'm a digger so vinyl will always trump Serato.\n\nWhat is your fave albums in your collection?\n\nI have so many favorites I wouldn't know where to begin!\n\nWhat tracks are you currently playing?\n\nKaytranada feat. Vic Mensa Drive Me Crazy, BJ The Chicago Kid feat. ScHoolBoy Q It's True, Meek Mill Ice Cream Freestyle, Joey Bada$$ No 99.\n\nHow do you approach a mash-up?\n\nIt's a pretty simple process to me. Most times the idea to mix an acapella over a particular beat will come as I'm deejayin live. I'll have the track going first then I'll grab the acapella and try it out in the cue. If everything pans out, I'll run it right then. If it hits me a certain way, that's when I decide whether or not to formerly make an official blend out of it in the lab.\n\nCan you tell us about your projects?\n\nI've been doing mixtapes (real mixtapes) since 1998. From Undreground Hip-Hop to indie soul, I was putting them out constantly. I started doing the blend projects in 2008. The first one was entitled American Gangstarr where I put Jay Z's American Gangster lyrics over beats by Gang Starr. In 2012, I put out Blends featuring mix-ups of Whitney Houston and Thundercat, Mary Mary and Run-DMC, The Beastie Boys and Tyler, The Creator, Adele and Mr. Cheeks, etc. The last 2 I did were A Tribe Called Kast (Outkast over ATCQ) in 2013 and The Notorious Exchange (B.I.G. over The Foreign Exchange) in 2014.\n\nHow can people find you?\n\nPeople can find me on facebook (Nappy DJ Needles or James Biko), twitter and instagram (@nappydjneedles), soundcloud.com/nappydjneedles, mixcloud.com/djneedles and check out my projects at ghettoblastic.bandcamp.com\n\nAny last words?\n\nThanks for listening...stay tuned for more\n\nHere are some places to check out some of Nappy DJ Needles.\n\nhttp://www.twitter.com/nappydjneedles\nhttp://www.facebook.com/nappydjneedles\nhttp://www.ghettoblastic.bandcamp.com\nhttp://www.ghettoblastic.com\nhttp://www.allpropsdeserved.com",

It's not often in today's landscape that a white rapper isn't even acknowledged by critics as a white rapper. Maybe that's because he isn't part of the problem in today's hip-hop culture. If anything he's a trailblazer who's helping to steer our ship towards the promised land it was once on course for. Much like Action Bronson, his ora seems authentic, making his appeal less forced than some of his peers.\nBack in the line of fire – saying my style is dated is like is checking to see if wine expires.\n\n– Your Old Droog from the song Porno For Pyros\n\nTrue to his out of nowhere approach, the once faceless (Nas-ish sounding) Droog dropped his latest EP yesterday called Kinison, much to my joy. While his first album was full of gritty jazz, soul and funk samples – tamed by DJ Skizz – this latest effort contains a cornucopia of rock nods; however, this album is (sonically) all hip-hop sans the 90's rock references sprinkled throughout.\n\nDroog expands his production team slightly as El RMTC and Marco Polo help Skizz with heavy lifting this time around. This album is full of bangers. Standouts for me were the Skizz produced Porno For Pyros, which I recognized from his, Gentrify My Hood, in which Droog discusses CI's (apparent) lack of amenities and lastly the Marco Polo produced Sonic Youth. Understand me though, that's subjective, because tracks like Blood and Homicide will have you breaking rewind buttons. There is literally no filler.\n\nHe's more than a similar voice. Droog stays true to himself, and once again puts together a cohesive project that ignores conventions (set by radio and mass media). This album seems slightly more approachable for some reason – I'm struggling to fully put my finger on it – which may make hI'm slightly easier for some to digest. With an upcoming tour with PRhyme 2015 is looking like a good year for CI's finest.\n\nGet familiar.",

Not many (90's) rappers can claI'm such a record. Blahzay Martell is one of the ones who can. In the 90's, as one half of the group Blahzay Blahzay with DJ PF Cuttin, he released the album Blah Blah Blah, which contained the godly, chart topping single Danger.\n\nBlahz has had an interesting career to say the least – from an unspoken role in the East-coast west-coast beef and a (professional) relationship with Biggie Smalls to performing around the world.

In fact, we're the first ones to post it – give it a spin below.\n\nBlahzay Martell was kind enough to chat with me about his career, his music and his new.

All of that music from the late 80's early 90's. My problem was, when you meet the artist your perspective change a lot and I met a lot of artists growing up in Brooklyn. But Guru and Premo of GANGSTARR became real unique in my influences, because they were exactly the same people in real life they were on their records.\n\nTalk about the breakout hit Danger.\n\nEverybody in NYC was popping off at the time except EAST NEW YORK, so we was trying to make a anthem for our hood.\n\nDid you know that it would be a hit?\n\nI knew everybody around my way would love it, but not so many people around the world.\n\nWas it your favourite track on \"Blah Blah Blah\"? If not, what was?\n\nMy favorite is because of the story. I think everybody loves a good story.\n\nCan you share any of your most memorable moments from that period in your career?\n\nPerforming and getting love in places in Europe where people never met black people or even Americans.\n\nCan you tell us about your relationship with Notorious B.I.G?\n\nWe was both managed by Dj Mister Cee, and was a part of that original entourage that travelled with Big, breaking his music.\n\nThere was never an official 2nd (album) release for Blahzay Blahzay – can you share why not?\n\nOne of the major reasons was the record industry flip flopping on us after Biggie and Tupac was murdered. Everyone ran far away from the East Coast vs West Coast campaign.The record that brought us to international recognition was later getting me black balled and Mercury closed their black music department.\n\nWhat are some of things (musically) you've worked on since that period?\n\nHellz yeah a lot of music, but one of the biggest things I'm proud of is being a part of bringing Hip-Hop to the East again, Far East, to Thailand with the hip hop group THAITANIUM.\n\nDo you still work with PF?\n\nOh yeah he's a major part of the present production in a lot of different ways. In the past he did exclusive production now he's giving his golden ear to a lot of younger producers.\n\nTell us about your podcast \"\"?\n\nIm sitting down with some of the hottest recording artists and comedians for a round table discussion about everything relevant today.\n\nWhat are you currently working on?\n\nMy new album.\n\nWhat are your thoughts on the current state of NYC hip-hop?\n\nIt's going in a great direction and I really respect a lot of the new artists that was able to be successful in a era that had no CDs and vinyl.\n\nWhat are your top 3 albums ever?\n\nI can't race them like horses, there are too many that hold a special place.\n\nWhat keeps you motivated to continue making music?\n\nI like to say music is in me not on me and if you really listen to my first album you would know them kids will be doing music forever.\n\nTell us about your latest song/video.\n\nWake up / No Sleeping, the name says it all. Reflecting on how we, as a society, are nothing but sheeples being led to slaughter.\n\nAny last words for our readers?\n\nDon't be a SHEEPLES! Keep supporting that above average hip hop.\n\nBonus reading: You may want to check out the interview I did with the other half of Blahzay Blahzay Dj PF Cuttin'.",

In the past he did exclusive production now he's giving his golden ear to a lot of younger producers.\n\nTell us about your podcast \"\"?\n\nIm sitting down with some of the hottest recording artists and comedians for a round table discussion about everything relevant today.\n\nWhat are you currently working on?\n\nMy new album.\n\nWhat are your thoughts on the current state of NYC hip-hop?\n\nIt's going in a great direction and I really respect a lot of the new artists that was able to be successful in a era that had no CDs and vinyl.\n\nWhat are your top 3 albums ever?\n\nI can't race them like horses, there are too many that hold a special place.\n\nWhat keeps you motivated to continue making music?\n\nI like to say music is in me not on me and if you really listen to my first album you would know them kids will be doing music forever.\n\nTell us about your latest song/video.\n\nWake up / No Sleeping, the name says it all. Reflecting on how we, as a society, are nothing but sheeples being led to slaughter.\n\nAny last words for our readers?\n\nDon't be a SHEEPLES! Keep supporting that above average hip hop.\n\nBonus reading: You may want to check out the interview I did with the other half of Blahzay Blahzay Dj PF Cuttin'.",

    "content": "\"My history with Kanye is I didn't respect hI'm as a rapper because I was around the greatest rappers....but he has courage.\" \n\n—Dame Dash\n\nBusiness Never Personal was the ironic title of the pre-breakup album by EPMD. Amidst rumours that PMD was withholding monies and Erick paid goons to rob Parrish Smith's home, the crew broke up indefinitely. Fortunately for fans that indefinitely turned out to only be 3 years. This is just one of many hip-hop breakups that we've all had to collective go through – think Fugees, Geto Boys, etc.\n\nHowever, no break-up can truely top the Roc-A-Fella team. No need to fully elaborate on the widely public circumstances, but like many divorces, the children were the casualties. It was this splitting of allegiances that ended up causing further rifts and, eventually, ended an era. Most notably Kanye West, whom Dame is credited as first signing, followed Jay. Outspoken Dame was understandably upset.\n\nIt wasn't until recently that the duo reunited. Dame was on hand to present Kanye with an award at the Hip-Hop Honours, and if a picture is worth a thousand words, then Dame's smile as he took a selfie with Yeezus and his daughter could write a book. As Dame made clear – his issues were more than business, this was emotional. It was obvious this reunion meant a lot to him.\n\nToday we received more news on Dame and Kanye – they are about to launch a new business venture. They are starting a film company, which is fitting considering Dame's experience and Kanye's apparent interest in short films. It's an exciting new venture, and I'm curious to see how it rolls out.\n\nHere is what Dame had to say about the situation:\n\n“The thing we don’t do historically and culturally is stick together but we are stopping that now if we stick together we don’t need any middle men from others cultures… We know we can do it on our own…but we are so powerful together…pause and we have our own money..we already made history in music so we can do that for fun so we’re gonna do movies… This is like when Spielberg and Geffen got together and did dreamworks…it’s time…me and kanye making movies and my brother Qtip was there to bless the deal.”\n\nCongratulations to these two brothers on their new endeavour – and for putting the pettiness aside. This is a win for hip-hop.",

Admittedly, the first time I came upon Rosewood 2055, formally The Action Figures, was this past weekend when I stumble upon the latest joint by Slum Village,. After a little research, I discovered that the duo have been touring the world with the Detroit-bred institution (that originally counted Dilla as part of their roster) and have worked with the likes of and Statik Selecktah (amongst others). What was even more surprising, was that their upcoming Top Ramen is their debut mix-tape (sans some singles).\n\nThey have a journey ahead of them, but their current team and show dates have them primed to make some serious noise this year. I reached out to Marq Beyond, on half of Rosewood, to learn a little more about the duo.\n\nWho are Rosewood 2055?\n\nKysean and Marq Beyond. Two kids from Grand Rapids, MI.\n\nHow did you come together – and what prompted your name change?\n\nWe met in High School, I had a crew I ran with and was known for being the rapper. Ky and I were cool, but I didnt get to know hI'm til later and I was blown away by how passionate and knowledgeable he was on Hip-Hop and the culture. We just clicked. The Action Figures grew to be bigger than both of us and it's more of an ideal and way of life. So TAF is Wu Tang and Rosewood 2055 is Rae and Ghost. 2055 Rosewood Ave is the address of the High School we went to.\n\nWho were/are some of your influences?\n\nThe culture in general is what influences us most. What it means and stands for. Everyone who's contributed to the culture included.\n\nHow do you define your sound?\n\nI wouldn't say there's any definitive sound. We both have our own ideas for songs and music and we bring the best of what we have and meet in the middle. The only thing we never, ever compromise is lyricism. So as long as we're free to say what we like, how we like, its a 20's record.\n\nWho are some of the artists you've worked with?\n\nWe've worked with Lee Bannon, Chuck Strangers, Rapper Big Pooh, Guilty Simpson, Statik Selektah, Illmind, Earlly Mac etc. We like to work with a variety of different artists, to pull from different avenues of inspiration and creativity. We got a few surprises coming soon as well.\n\nHow did you connect with Slum Village?\n\nOur management has had a close relationship with them for awhile. We sent them some music and they asked us to come out. We all ended up clicking, and they're like our big brothers now.\n\nHow has working with them helped to shape you as artists?\n\nIt definitely changed the way we work. They work so fast and move even faster, so it was either keep up or get left behind. They made us rededicate ourselves to the craft too! We've spent days at a time locked in the studio. The shortest session was probably 10 hours. We know now, that its work and you get back what you put in.\n\nHow's the tour life?\n\nTouring is dope as hell man. Thats the part we've always wanted most. Being in a new city, connecting. Its can be hectic, with schedules to keep but its worth the early hours. For sure.\n\nWhat was your fave show so far?\n\nNew York cause it was the very first night, or Milan, Italy.\n\nIt's astounding that you haven't even released your debut yet! What can we expect from Top Ramen?\n\nJust expect good Hip-Hop lol. We want everybody to be excited about getting some good Hip-Hop first and foremost.\n\nWhat are your goals?\n\nThe goal is to keep growing, and keep moving as a unit. With that in mind, we hope to get to a Slum Status one day.\n\nThink quick: top 3 albums – go!\n\nThriller\n Reasonable Doubt\n Late Registration\n\nAny last words for our readers?\n\nThank you for having us. Catch us @ rosewood2055.com and on select dates of the Slum Village/ Pete Rock tour. Top Ramen and Yes! Coming soon.\n\nUPDATE\nPeer their latest single!",

His name and Tumblr have been popping up all over the web on sites like Complex, which instantly caught my attention. His hip-hop portraits have received nods from the likes of Rick Ross, Big Sean and Joey Bada$$. Back at home, his work has been displayed at Brisfest, and exhibited at Philadelphia Street Gallery in Cabot Circus – he even has another exhibit opening up next week. Also, Bristol-based Rife Magazine recently featured hI'm in their 24 under 24 list, and I don't blame them honestly.\n\nHe's a super talented kid, and I decided to reach out to hI'm for a quick Q&A. Get to know a little more about Just Scribble in the interview below.\n\n[gallery columns=\"4\" link=\"file\" ids=\"1185,1184,1180,1181\"]\n\nIntroduce yourself.\n\nI’m ‘Just Scribble’, a self taught artist from the UK.\n\nHow did you get into art?\n\nDrawing is something I’ve been doing since the age of 2. I continued to do it throughout my childhood, so there wasn’t any real moment I got into Art; it just naturally found me.\n\nCan you tell us about the work you have on your Tumblr?\n\nThe work I have on my tumblr is a collection of drawings/paintings, mainly of Hip-Hop artists that have inspired me over the years.\n\nDo you exhibit it?\n\nYeah, I’ve had my work exhibited in two galleries so far. I’ve got another exhibition coming up this weekend.\n\nWho was the first rapper to take notice of your work?\n\nThe first major rapper to take notice of my work was Rick Ross. I was fairly new to twitter at the time, so I was just tweeting a bunch of my pieces on there. I posted a drawing I did of Rick Ross, not expecting hI'm to see it. The next thing I knew, he retweeted the drawing and followed me.\n\nWhat was that like?\n\nThat was a big moment for me. From then on I began seeking the attention of bigger names within the Hip-Hop industry.\n\nWhat are you currently working on now?\n\nI’m not working on anything at the moment. I only work when I’m inspired to create something, so right now I’m taking a break until I get hit with some inspiration.\n\nWhat are your fave hip-hop albums right now?\n\nI don’t have any current favourites in terms of albums right now. A lot of what’s come out recently is good, but not mind blowing. My favourite mixtape at the moment is Mick Jenkins – The Water[s]. That tape is deep.\n\nWhere can people see more of your work – and can they purchase it?\n\nFor more of my work, you can check out my website: http://www.justscribbleart.com\n\nYou can also purchase prints of my work from The Fifth Wall website -http://www.thefifthwall.co.uk/shop/index.php/artists/justscribble.html\n\nAnything else you'd like to share with our readers.\n\nI would just like to thank everybody who’s been supporting & encouraging me in my art career so far.",

Get to know a little more about Just Scribble in the interview below.\n\n[gallery columns=\"4\" link=\"file\" ids=\"1185,1184,1180,1181\"]\n\nIntroduce yourself.\n\nI’m ‘Just Scribble’, a self taught artist from the UK.\n\nHow did you get into art?\n\nDrawing is something I’ve been doing since the age of 2. I continued to do it throughout my childhood, so there wasn’t any real moment I got into Art; it just naturally found me.\n\nCan you tell us about the work you have on your Tumblr?\n\nThe work I have on my tumblr is a collection of drawings/paintings, mainly of Hip-Hop artists that have inspired me over the years.\n\nDo you exhibit it?\n\nYeah, I’ve had my work exhibited in two galleries so far. I’ve got another exhibition coming up this weekend.\n\nWho was the first rapper to take notice of your work?\n\nThe first major rapper to take notice of my work was Rick Ross. I was fairly new to twitter at the time, so I was just tweeting a bunch of my pieces on there. I posted a drawing I did of Rick Ross, not expecting hI'm to see it. The next thing I knew, he retweeted the drawing and followed me.\n\nWhat was that like?\n\nThat was a big moment for me. From then on I began seeking the attention of bigger names within the Hip-Hop industry.\n\nWhat are you currently working on now?\n\nI’m not working on anything at the moment. I only work when I’m inspired to create something, so right now I’m taking a break until I get hit with some inspiration.\n\nWhat are your fave hip-hop albums right now?\n\nI don’t have any current favourites in terms of albums right now. A lot of what’s come out recently is good, but not mind blowing. My favourite mixtape at the moment is Mick Jenkins – The Water[s]. That tape is deep.\n\nWhere can people see more of your work – and can they purchase it?\n\nFor more of my work, you can check out my website: http://www.justscribbleart.com\n\nYou can also purchase prints of my work from The Fifth Wall website -http://www.thefifthwall.co.uk/shop/index.php/artists/justscribble.html\n\nAnything else you'd like to share with our readers.\n\nI would just like to thank everybody who’s been supporting & encouraging me in my art career so far.",

    "content": "This album has absolutely no filler – and flows coherently from cover to cover. It's intricate, down to the last detail, atmospheric and full of depth.\n\nThere's something to be said for live instrumentation, or rather, using actual musicians to record live music. It's a practice that was often reserved for (some) live performances and platforms like SNL and Jimmy Fallon; however, with exception of a few groups, namely The Roots, there has historically been a severe lack of Hip-Hop bands. It's actually perplexing, when you stop to consider the amount of live instrumentation that has actually gone into the work of some of the most iconic producers of our day. That's beginning to change though, and over the past few years there has been a rise in live hip-hop. Some notable collborations that I personally enjoyed were, and. Today though, I have a new favourite. Ghostface Killah and GOODGOODNOTBAD have unleashed their jazzy new project Sour Soul on the people – and it's marvellous.\n\nArgue that Ghostface Killah isn't one one of the hardest working cats in the game today. Pro tip: you can't. Fresh off of 36 seasons, which was one of my favourite albums of 2014, the great Ghostini is back in effect, this time collaborating with Toronto-based hip-hop/jazz outfit BADBADNOTGOOD (BBNG). If you're not familiar with that name, they’ve collaborated with Tyler, The Creator on multiple occasions, opened for Roy Ayers, and backed Frank Ocean at the 2012 Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival as band-in-residence. They've also produced for Earl Sweatshirt and Danny Brown.\n\nThis album is first, and foremost, a true collaboration. It's just as much a showcase of the trio's musical ability as it is a showcase of Ghostface's infinite potential to drop bars, on bars, on bars (and so on). In fact, GFK even sits a few of the tracks out, letting the guys shine. Tracks like Mono, Stark's Reality and Experience add mood and character to the album, as do extra long outros and transitions. \n\nThere are a few guest 16's on this album, including Elzhi on the heavy hitting Gunshowers, Danny Brown on Six Degrees, and the ever elusive – and always dope – MF Doom on Raygun. A standout for me was the -tinged Street Knowledge featuring Tree. This album has absolutely no filler – and flows coherently from cover to cover. It's intricate, down to the last detail, atmospheric and full of depth. Ghostface gives the listener jewels that range from the overbearing nature of the alphabet boys on Sour Soul, to some overwhelming positivity on the aptly titled Nuggets Of Wisdom.\n\nThis album is a breath of fresh air, and is sure to inspire many MC's to work with live musicians for their next project. Oh and if anyone in the game STILL isn't up on BBNG, they are about to be – in a major way.",

    "content": "\"Few rap albums of the modern era have the pure testicular quality of Jealous One's Envy...\"\n\n– AllMusic\n\nThe biggest problem with being a (major) hip-hop head, is that sometimes you end up in conversations with others, and you have to find a way not to come off as a know-it-all. I wish I could explain how many times I’ve heard the South Bronx rapper Fat Joe described as being discovered by Big Pun. It’s like looking at a crooked picture if you have OCD. It's maddening. I want to slap them and explain that Joe has been around for like EVER, and was an amazing, non-commercially motivated hip-hop architect during the golden era.\n\nSo here I go – let's all go back to 1993.\n\nI thought i’d share a bit about the Fat Joe that most heads either don’t know, or don’t acknowledge (anymore). Fat Joe was originally a member of the DITC crew, meaning he rolled with the likes of Diamond D, Showbiz & AG, Lord Finesse, and the late-great Big L. He was vicious on the mic, and in 1993 on the Relativity Records imprint he dropped his debut solo album, Represent. It was dope. It featured production from his DITC brethren, as well as hip-hop mainstays like the Beatnuts. The album spurred the iconic single Flow Joe, and the far less talked about Watch The Sound featuring Grand Puba and Diamond D. Keep in mind, this is 1993, so names like Puba and Diamond were a big  deal. The album also had verses from Apache and Kool G Rap. It also featured the original version of his classic The Shit Is Real. Critics didn’t hate it.\n\nThen Joe dropped his second album, Jealous Ones Envy, which i’ll preface by saying is one of those albums that just hit me the right way when it dropped. It was the soundtrack to my life. Let’s point out the goods: The Shit’s Real, and Success –both produced by DJ Premier. Respect Mine featuring Raekwon, Bronx Tale featuring KRS-ONE. The album is so gritty, so NYC, and just so hip-hop. the production is absolutely gorgeous.\n\nThe real true gem here though, is the song Watch Out, which was the first recorded appearance of Big Pun.\n\nNext up, Joe – high off the success of his new artist Big Pun – dropped the still \"street\", but slightly more commercial effort Don Cartagena. It was super feature heavy, and had tracks that were made almost entirely for mainstream radio/tv, namely Don Cartegena featuring Diddy and Bet Ya Man Can’t (Triz) featuring Pun, Cuban Link and Triple Seis. The album did have heat, like the still dope John Blaze. Honestly, in hindsight, this album isn’t that \"commercial\". Especially when you stack it against everything Joe made from this point on in his career. It was just much less street than his first two releases; however it worked in his favour, selling Gold. It was his most successful album to date.\n\nSadly, this is where the train has stopped for me. I wasn’t really a fan of his music from this point on. I mean, he had some heaters here and there, but it just got way too commercial for my personal taste; and that’s no shade, good on him. He has a family to feed, and it’s all about building and elevating. But for me, his music doesn’t have the soul it once did. I highly encourage you dig into his past catalogue though, because he did exist before What’s Luv with Ashanti. He’s the man who brought Big Pun to the forefront – and he deserves all the credit in the world.\n\nLet’s pay tribute to 90’s Fat Joe!",

His music seems to blend in and innovate simultaneously, that is to say, it doesn't slap you in the face with blatant oddity, like say Outkast [editor note: he's been sonically compared to Andre 3000], nor does it seamlessly fit into the trap sound that currently rules the city's main arteries.\n\nHis latest release, Need To Know II: Luna, is a big win on a few fronts. It satisfies his core, who were open off of joints like Chrome and his original tape, but also breaks some new commercial ground. The latter point is important, because I'm tired of telling people they are sleeping on this kid. For the most part, Luna sticks to the formula (not a bad thing). His production ranges from a \"riding around at night\" vibe on tracks like Road Trips and the aggressively flowed Noctuno to a smoothed-out vibe on tracks like Black Alablaster and The Root part II (part one had a ).\n\nThe standouts here for me were the L.A VanGogh produced New To Me, and his brilliantly executed Marthié François Girbaud, in which he lyrically reminisces time travels back to 1996, to revisit block life and then to 2006 to relive a run-in with Chicago law enforcement. There's also the head nodding True Enough, which is the closest to a literal love song you're going get here.

On Need To Know II: Luna, Xavier avoids overly experimenting outside of his trademark sound, and rather delivers a solid, consistent project that flows from start to finish.

    "title": "Moka Only Interview",
    "content": "I just keep going for what I know. Just doing it. Living it. Breathing it.\n\n– Moka Only\n\nThere’s nothing like pure musical expression that comes from the heart. It’s hard to find in the mainstream (music scene), but it’s easy to find in the expansive catalogue of Vancouver-based artist Moka Only.\n\nRoughly 13 years ago, it was impossible to go anywhere in Canada without hearing the sound of Mad Child, Prevail and Moka Only, otherwise known (collectively) as. The trio had a string of hits that ruled both airwaves and television (back when Much Music played actual music). It wasn’t long after 2003 when the smooth voice that graced the bulk of their choruses went solo.\n\nSince the Swollen days, Moka Only has released an almost unheard of amount of music (seriously his Wikipedia lists well over 50 albums), and has worked with the likes of Ayatollah, Abstract Rude, Planet Asia, Dilla and more. He is currently running with a collective artists known as the Torchlight Commission, which consists of Illa J, among others.\n\nHe’s an incredibly hardworking guy, with a genuine love for what he does. In the interview below he shares some insight on his time with Swollen, his inspirations, his work with Dilla, and his upcoming projects.\n\nCan you start by introducing yourself?\n\nHulooooo! I’m Moka Only, otherwise known as Kareem Serene – among other things. Torchlight commission is my crew. How you doing?\n\nI’m doing great brother! Not to sound all Brown Sugar, but how did you fall in love with hip-hop music?\n\nI fell in love with hip-hop at an early age, probably in a similar fashion to a lot of other cats in the 80s. Just being around in the streets after school or even during. Some cats would put out the cardboard on the ground at school and start breakin’ with the box blasting. That made too much of an impression to ignore. I had to be down! Tried my hand at dancing, but it wasn’t my area of excellence. Rap just started happening from doing silly freestyles in 1986 to forgetting about it then picking it back up a couple years later – but with a pen. I was hooked! Still am.\n\nHow did you originally hook up with Swollen Members?\n\nSwollen Members came out after Prevail and I sort of failed at being a duo. We met up with Madchild, who was also from Vancouver, and it sort of just clicked.This was around 1995. Came up with the name and just started from there. We connected with a lot of our other west-coast contemporaries at the time. I soon after realized I’d rather be solo but we kept doing work together – even more so during the early 2000s when I jumped back in the group for a hot minute. Much love to Swollen.\n\nYou talk about your experience with them on the song “”. What prompted you to leave the group?\n\nAs for what I said on sleeping dogs, that was more or less a rundown of my last 15 years. There was no “break up”. It was just me being involved with the group for awhile. We made great music and memories – to this day Swollen. I just prefer the solo route, as I mentioned.\n\nLet’s talk about your work ethic, because your discography is INSANE. How much time do you spend in the studio?\n\nMy studio ethic is serious, but I still make time for all the other stuff. It’s just that I love the creative aspect so much. That’s where the magic is – and it’s how I can communicate with the cosmos. I don’t really think about it, I just do it. Always been like that. Im not out to prove a point that I work harder than others, i’m just trying to maximize on my time.\n\nDo you have lots of unreleased material left over from all of your projects? Can we anticipate more releases like California Sessions Vol. 2?\n\nOh yes, I have a TON of other unreleased material from the early 2000s. It makes sense that I would, because I was busy with the group thing for a couple years, which didn’t leave a lot of time to put out and promote my solo projects properly. Then when I left the group again, I didn’t really look back on my vaults cause I’d rather make new stuff. At least thats how I felt at the time. It was all recorded on ADAT systems, and if you know anything about ADAT it’s old technology that was plagued with quirks and tape eating. My last machine crashed in 2003 and I didn’t replace it until two years ago, so I was finally able to go back through the tape stuff and mix old songs from 2002 and 2003. There’s SO much! I love it and still feel strongly about the material even though I feel i’ve improved vastly.\n\nThere’s an innocence about the old material that I appreciate. It’s as if the more you learn, the more serious it all gets and you become caught up in the methodology more so rather than the FEELING. I think lately I’ve been returning to the raw FEELING rather than worrying about keeping up with whatever is hot. I’m always just going to be me. I’m not the punchline rapper, I’m more of an arranger of vibes – and yeah, that sounds kinda corny. haha.\n\nWhat’s your creative process like?\n\nTo speak on the creative process I don’t want to give too much away, but let’s just say I do it the “old” way. It's all outboard gear, no protools and all that. I use hardware, samplers, instruments and tape even to create the “Moka” sound, if I may be so bold. I mainly start with beats, because I’m a beat maker at heart first and foremost. The beats will dictate the vibe. I’ll either write or freestyle from that point on, then add more sprinkles and mix it. I do this every day when I’m not on tour so, you can imagine it piles up. Mainly every session is just to get sharper and to have sort of a journal – but if I have a project I’m working on then I stick to the theme of it.\n\nYou’re also (often) known as Ron Contour and Torch. Are these alter-egos, or simply just names?\n\nRon Contour is really the only other alter ego I’ve used. It’s a whole different character I haven’t visited that much at all lately. All the other names from the past are monikers, just fun stuff to keep it interesting for me and for the fans. Kareem Serene is my latest, even though technically I came up with that in 2003. I’m drinking a coffee right now. Ive never flown a blimp.\n\nYou’ve worked with the late-great J.Dilla, what was that like? What influence did his music have on you?\n\nAs far as the Dilla thing goes Im not sure what to say about it. I had reached out to hI'm in the early 2000s and he seemed receptive and sent me 6 beat CDs. It was being arranged that I would roll out to Detroit and work with hI'm in person. Being that I’m a pretty solitary person, and more so at the time, I decided I would rather record alone at home and thats what I did. A certain beat stood out to me and I just took it from there, freaked it and released it a couple years later. I always had the utmost respect for hI'm though. In many ways he felt like both a peer and a teacher. A peer in the sense that when I became aware of his music, it felt like I had met a cousin or something. He was on some original shit, and took chances musically. That’s what I felt I was doing – his reliance on jazz textures is something I related to, since I had been doing that since the 90s as well. In the early 2000s it felt like not many other cats were.\n\nAs far as the teacher comment, his techniques bred creative sparks in all of us. I’m happy to say that the vibe has continued now that I do a lot of work with his brother Illa J. He’s also part of the movement I mentioned before, Torchlight Commission. Like-minded folks keeping the torch burning.\n\nThis may be a tough question, but what’s your fave album of yours? Can you maybe give a top 3?\n\nI think my fave three albums I’ve released would be Lowdown Suite, Doctor Do Much and Martian Xmas 2009. At least right now that’s it…lol.\n\nWhat can you tell us about NO?\n\nNo, I cant tell you about NO. It’s a secret. It won’t be for much longer though. I can say this though: It’s a song. haha.\n\nWhat do you have coming up?\n\nComing up, I’m working on an album called Brutal and another one called Magical Weirdness. Magical Weirdness was made for a certain record label that I don’t want to mention, because I want to do a proper announcement when the time comes and the album is turned in. Plus, there’s a chance they may not even LIKE it. I’m sure they will, but I don’t have expectations other than I know that good shit will happen regardless. Can I hint? hmmm…maybe I’d better not. I also have the NO single, which is independent.\n\nI’m also starting a record label with my manager called Beautiful Records, and no, I’m not looking for demos. I have a couple other cats in mind from my crew that I will release – but anybody that ends up on my label has to have similar musical values. That’s what we’re trying to accomplish with Torchlight Commission, Kinda like how Native Tounges was in the 90s. Just some cats that share a theme, but do they own thing. Not like a Wu-Tang thing, more loose.\n\nYou’ve been in the game for like 20+ years, is it a trip to see how things have changed so much?\n\nThings have definitely changed. It HAS been a trip. The internets, the disposability of music as a result, and the way music is promoted. But the function remains the same as it did throughout all time – to entertain. THAT wont change. I just keep going for what I know. Just doing it. Living it. Breathing it.\n\nWhat keeps you influenced/motivated?\n\nThe thing that keeps me going is just that, keeping going. I'm inspired by the feedback, and being able to do interviews like this – I appreciate having the podium to speak. Touring is also inspiring. To meet my fans and talk to like minded people is unbelievably beautiful. Just being a human, there’s so much shared experiences to muse upon in song form that we all can relate to. I CANNOT see how an artist could ‘run out of ammo’, so to speak. Just do the damn thing! Don’t worry about what all the other musicians are doing. Yeah. Eggs. Carrots.\n\nDo you have any last thoughts or shoutouts for our readers?\n\nOn a closing note, I want to say thanks for the opportunity to speak – and  start looking up the Torchlight Commission! Between Me, Jon Rogers, Nick Wisdom, Illa J, Astrogical, Mosaic, A-Ro, Mr Brady, etc, we have a LOT of bang for your buck and your mind. Much love from Kareem Serene.",

    "title": "Laya LaRoche Interview",
    "content": "\"Do what you want kitties! Live your life and don't let anyone tell you how to live it!\"\n—Laya LaRoche\n\nAs a preface, I'll say that the R&B game is quite funny sometimes. Things come in waves, which often leaves us with many artists who sound similar. Sometimes though, you bump into a singer that has it factor – a singer on his/her plain, that writes their music and commands your attention. Alicia Keys for example. Some singers just keep it real and lean on pure \"skills\" as opposed to auto tune and commercial influence.\n\nNow, I've been known to get obsessed with tracks on SoundCloud, and last week I lived up my reputation. While cruising for some unsigned hype, I came across New York-based singer Laya LaRoche. Her song No Gravity off of her debut album (she has two) Let Them Eat Cake had me stuck. I decided to reach to and learn more about the songstress.\n\nCheck the interview below.\n\nCan you introduce yourself to our readers?\n\nAyyyee, my name is Laya LaRoché.\n\nHow did you get involved in music?\n\nI've been singing my entire life. My family was always involved in music and the performing arts, so singing and creating my songs has been something that has always come naturally to me.\n\nWho were some of your influences coming into the game?\n\nBrandy has molded me in many ways. Missy Elliot, Jasmine Sullivan, Spice Girls, Gorillaz, and most of the all black female R&B groups of the 90s.\nI loved the ghetto funk of 90s R&B. My iPod still mostly consists of that type of music to this day.\n\nWhat can you tell us about your latest project?\n\nSeraphic Nightmare is a moodier side of me. I wrote most of the songs when I was quite depressed. Even at my lowest I still experienced some moments of joy and happiness, and that's what inspired me to call the collection of these songs Seraphic Nightmare. I was suffering from constant nightmares in real life at the time, and that inspired me to write songs like Run that later proved to be beneficial for me. This bit of good that came out of my sorrow. The seraphic in my nightmare.\n\nHow is it different from?\n\nLet Them Eat Cake was more fun and free. It was also my first project, so I was trying to establish a style/sound of my own. There also wasn't an overall theme. Every track had a different vibe, but I like that. When I had released it a lot of people told me that they were disappointed that I didn't \"sing out\" enough and that I was playing it safe. I took note of this and made sure to show my vocal range and just only go off on Seraphic Nightmare which wasn't hard since it was more emotionally driven.\n\nWhat's your writing/creative process like?\n\nI have a lot of producer friends, and I meet more everyday. They'll send me a beat, and I'll vibe to it for a few train rides until the words come to me. I hear the melodies first, and then the words just fall into place. I've written most of my songs while on the train or a bus. When I have those moments to myself while traveling through the chaos, I seem to be more in tune with my inner voice. Weed helps too.\n\nThink quick: Vinyl or CD? Why?\n\nI'm part of the CD generation (well cassette tapes really) so I'd have to go with CD. I can skip straight to my favorite track and put it on repeat like that (snaps finger)! And don't forget about the cd walkmans!! Can't carry a vinyl while listening. I do appreciate vinyl tho. I'd love to get vinyl copies of my projects at some point. It's just classic. I'd hate to see them disappear.\n\nWhat's your fave album of all time? Why?\n\nDaaaammnnn. That's hard. It's a toss up between Brandy Never Say Never and Gorillaz debut album. For me, both albums were highly influential. If I had to choose one I would have to go with Brandy, Never Say Never. My mother bought me the cd for Three Kings Day when I was 8 (because we're Spanish, and we give, each other gifts on Three Kings Day). I played the CD on repeat until it didn't work anymore. I love every song on that album. Her voice, the lyrics, the production, her emotion. It was all so on point. I still listen to it on the regular to this day.\n\nHow would you describe your live show?\n\nMy live show is fun! I try to have as much fun as I can. I usually start with the turn-up records to get people going and then once I've gotten their attention I bring them into my world. With songs like Run, I have a stage hand tie my hands behind my back and put a ski mask over my face. This always makes people shut up. As the music begins, I tell them, about the origins of the lyrics and welcome them into my world. I don't want to give too much away. I would like everyone to see it for themselves (shameless plug).\n\nWhat are your goals as an artist?\n\nMy goals as an artist are to bring back the music that I love and to continue creating new fusions of the music that I love – and pay my rent while doing so. Dead ass.\n\nWhat are you currently working on?\n\nRight now I'm putting together some new visuals. I have plenty of singles out now that I'm dying to shoot videos for. I've got a great team of artists and creatives that I'm super excited about working with. I can't wait to release some new cool juice for you guys!\n\nDo you have any last words you'd like to leave our readers with?\n\nDo what you want kitties! Live your life and don't let anyone tell you how to live it! We all have magic in us, and it's up to you how to use it.",
    "clean_content": "\"Do what you want kitties! Live your life and don't let anyone tell you how to live it!\"\n—Laya LaRoche\n\nAs a preface, I'll say that the R&B game is quite funny sometimes. Things come in waves, which often leaves us with many artists who sound similar. Sometimes though, you bump into a singer that has it factor – a singer on his/her plain, that writes their music and commands your attention. Alicia Keys for example.

    "content": "At the turn of the millennium, alternative hip-hop label Def Jux was dropping some pretty avant garde shit. The game was in a weird place – the golden era was over, and we weren't as deep in the musical \"cesspool\" we're engulfed in today. Artists like MF DOOM thrived in this particular pocket of time, as did the harlem duo Cannibal Ox. Rappers Vast Aire and Vordul Mega, over a sound bed provided by El-P (one half of Run the Jewels), released  in 2001, which was acclaimed as one of the best hip-hop albums of the preceding decade. Unfortunately, following a falling out with Def Jux, the duo all but disappeared. After a serious of empty promises of a awaited reunion, they emerged with a dope new album and a new sound. That sound belongs to New York-bred producer/rapper Bill Cosmiq.\n\nI recently had an opportunity to chat with Bill about his music, his influences and how he became the go-to producer for one of hip-hop's most acclaimed underground groups.\n\nCan you start by introducing yourself to the people?\n\nI’m a producer/emcee based out of New York City. I’m ½ of the group “The Quantum” and lead producer of Cannibal Ox’s Blade of the Ronin album.\n\nHow did you get into music?\n\nI’ve made music for years, developing beats for friends and local artists. I never put pressure on myself to record albums in the past. I jumped into the scene in recent years because I wasn’t hearing a lot of music I enjoyed. I was compelled to make a contribution.\n\nWhat/who were some of your influences?\n\nI’m influenced by all great musicians. Countless people have made an impression on me from Lee “Scratch” Perry to producers like DJ Premier and Timbaland.\n\nGrowing up, I remember seeing Quincy Jone’s signature on the back of Chaka Khan albums, movie soundtracks and Michael Jackson’s Thriller album. Seeing those album credits drove my interest in developing music across genres.\n\nHow would you describe your sound?\n\nI never put a label on my sound. Once I try to define it, I set an unnecessary boundary. I just try to keep it honest and inspired.\n\nWhat’s your creative process like when you produce/write?\n\nI try to get in a zone and allow my beats to naturally come together. Sometimes I have a seed of an idea before I sit down and work, but most times I work without an idea of what I want the outcome to be. Discovery is always part of my process.\n\nWhile making a beat, lyrics start to come to me inspired by what I hear. The music always drives a mood or mindset.\n\nHow did The Quantum (Salvador and you) come together?\n\nWe’ve known each other for years. We worked on music because we have a similar vision of the records we want to make. The response people had to our collaboration helped to drive the formation of “The Quantum”. No gimmicks or forced music. The Quantum is the middle ground where our creative styles meet.\n\nCan tell us a little about the?\n\nThe Paragon EP was an introduction to The Quantum’s sound. It’s a window into our mindset and what we are offering to the culture of Hip-Hop and music community at large. I feel like we are bringing the spirit of the “golden era” with a future-forward approach. The EP also features Kenyattah Black, Taj Hotep and Vast Aire.\n\nYou are the main producer of the latest Can Ox project, how did that come about?\n\nI linked up with Vast Aire years ago through a mutual friend, Taj Hotep. The first track we released was Royal Purple Bag off of Vast’s A Space Iliad EP. After that, Can Ox and I continued to connect and work on a number of records.\n\nThe team really responded to my beats which produced some inspired studio sessions. Ideas exchanged back and forth and the consistency of those sessions helped to fuel the energy behind Blade of the Ronin. It all comes down to chemistry in the lab.\n\nWhat was the process of putting Blade Of The Ronin together?\n\nI wanted the album to have a cohesive feeling all around. We didn’t rush the creative process. I let things come naturally and the compositions started developing an intense cinematic edge.\n\nAfter we created “Gotham” in 2013, Cannibal Ox and I started to discuss Ox City and what that environment is like. We discussed the look, tone and feel of that city. Blade of the Ronin is like a soundtrack that illustrates a walk through that environment.\n\nWhat is your fave song on the album, and why?\n\nI look at the album as a whole. The whole listening experience of the album is favoured.\n\nWhat's next for Bill Cosmiq?\n\nI’m focused on producing more quality music and presenting my creative ideas to listeners. The Quantum has a new project in the works and I’ve been collaborating with a diverse range of artists. I’m interested in working on a film score in the near future as well.\n\n…Cannibal Ox and I are still in the shop working on new heat!\n\nAny last words or shoutouts you'd like to leave our blog with?\n\nShout out to my IGC family and Above Average Hip-Hop",

While donning his trademark tin mask, he tackles beats with no regard for your thought process. He never breaks character, even in the streets. Why?

The album, stitched together as a collection of seemingly random gems, was non-commercial, creative and packaged with one of the most haunting covers I've ever come across.\n\nThe album, in hindsight, did a few things really well. Firstly, It took DOOM to another level. His previous project Mm Food was dope, and had DOOM's trademark sound, but this project seemed more polished. As seemingly random as it was, it was all orchestrated. DOOM showed many faces – he was a pimp, a pothead, a disgruntled boyfriend, a hustler and a troubled soul. He created a body of work that definitely requires multiple listens. Secondly, it really solidified Madlib as the shit. Not to say he wasn't dope before this – his work has been fire since Lootpack.

From Accordion and Money Folder to All Caps and Rhinestone Cowboy, his sound was eerie, inspiring and beautiful.\n\nDOOM never really topped this album in my mind, and it's an album I'll probably listen to and love it years from now.

Aside from his infamous Fuck That's Delicious web series, he's been hitting you with heaters for the past few years now. Amidst early comparisons to Wu-Tang Clan over-achiever Ghostface Killah – whom he toured with (haters) – Action has risen into the spotlight and it's now his time to smack the rap game in the f—ing face on a commercial level. Listening to this project it's hard to swallow (pause) that he's been rapping for just over five years. He quit his career as a chef to pursue rap, which will explain his extremely elaborate food references.\n\nAfter a fifth full listen I've come to some conclusions about Action's major-label debut album, Mr. Wonderful. It's brilliant. If you've been following his career over the past few years, you'll notice the growth he's had. He still has bars on top of bars – stuffed with more bars; however this album seems far less rushed. It has an interesting blend of sounds and emotions. The fun, airy vibe of the Mark Ronson produced Brand New Car sets the tone nicely. Don't go into this album without a sense of humour and an open mind.\n\nThe soundscape here is so well compiled. From the absolutely gorgeous Terry produced by Alchemist, the radio-friendly Actin' Crazy produced by OVO's own 40 to the psychedelic Party Supplies produced Easy Rider, he literally bodies every beat – one exception (for me) was the Oh No produced Only In America. It was a little more \"meh\" than the rest of the tracks. The album's most memorable moments happen halfway through when Action sings on the funky Mark Ronson joint City Boy Blues, which transitions in the super dope Baby Blue Eyes, featuring Chance The Rapper. If you haven't peeped the visuals for that track yet, scroll to the bottom. You're welcome.\n\nOverall it's an incredibly impressive album. It has bars, amazing production and enough reply value to keep this one in the deck for a hot minute. I recently read that he's also releasing a cook book with a number of famous chefs. Like it or not, Action is shaping up to have a better year than most of the other rappers on the scene right now. Don't hate – make better music.",

    "content": "When it comes to female MC's, who I always think of as just MC's, they seem to fall into two distinct groups these days: those who have bars and those who lean on their sexuality as a crutch. There's something to be said about having a deep roots in the culture you're contributing to. Enter Venomiss.\n\nHip-hop artist, and writer, Venomiss has paid her dues, rocking stages and battling her way into the game. Although she's currently writing for several websites and publications, such as HipHopDurso.com, music is still her main priority. \n\nGet to know Venomiss a little better in the interview below.\n\nIntroduce yourself\n\nThey call me Venomiss! I'm a female MC and Hip-Hop Journalistic Writer from Orange, NJ. I write for a few blogs and magazines and I do my own music as an independent artist.\n\nHow did you get involved in music?\n\nMusic was always around me in one way or another so it all kind of came together. My mom loved music and there was never a day in my house without music playing when I was young... Bob Marley, Sade, Kenny G, The Gap Band, Luther... you name it. I became in love with music. My dad was into being a DJ and he would let me practice, so I developed a ear for rhythms and drum patterns. He had some bars too! When I got older, my cousins were a huge part of me getting involved since they were heavy into hip hop and in rap groups of their own. Music became my happy place in life. It became my escape and my voice when I didn't think I had the courage to face the things I was up against. At the same time I don't think any one thing made me a MC, I believe it developed naturally in me and was brought out by events in my life both good and bad.\n\nWho are some of your influences?\n\nHonestly, most of the people who influence will never see a deal or the mainstream recognition. As a MC who started out literally walking up to groups of MCs that I didn't know who were in a cypher and basically jumping into their rotation, being around others who are hungry and creative influences me most. I didn't care who's hood I was in, what street I was on or who's shows, I just needed to be in the cypher! In turn, I met a lot of really talented MCs who I learned a lot from. Personal experiences and life lessons also influence me. Things I've seen or done. I draw influence from moods too I am definitely a mood writer. Sometimes the beat will influence me to write to a certain feeling I'm having.\n\nTell me about your music.\n\nI've been doing music since I was about 12 or 13, and took it seriously about 15 or 16. My music is about balance. I bring the street edge and I also bring hooks and lyrics that people can still go along with. I'm not so far old school Hip-Hop that I can't also appreciate and bring the new school Hip-Hop too.I find young and old Hip-Hop heads like my music. They all seem to find something they like about it. I saw a post on Twitter one time from a good friend of mine that reminds me of my music. It made me laugh actually when I saw it. The post was about being sophisticated ratchet. That describes my music to me. The post was saying sophisticated ratchet is hood enough to step up but smart enough to know when to. That's how I feel about my music. It's not too left field that you can't respect it, but it ain't above taking the earnings off and showing you the business either!\n\nTell me about your sound.\n\nThe most common feedback I get about my sound is my voice. I'm told I have a great voice for hip hop and radio often. People look for someone to compare it to but they generally just go back to saying they like the way my voice sounds on the beats when they can't find a direct match in their minds. My choice of production things that grab your attention. I like a little bounce to my records; almost a southern bounce without it being trap. I do draw some southern influences and I guess that comes from being a fan of Bone Thugs, but I am a Jersey girl born and raised so I also draw influences from Fabolous, Jay-Z, Jadakiss too. I guess I just like to be able to bounce to the beat.\n\nWhat are you currently working on?\n\nI just dropped the video for \"They Want\" which has been one of two singles off the upcoming album. I started out with the mindset that I was recording an EP but its honestly been so hard to narrow it down. My producers and I really have just been working off of our vibes and creating with no limitation. So I believe its growing from an EP to a full project. I've been in the studio a lot and focusing on making this a good project. Speaking of the album, it should be out soon. Stay tuned to my Twitter and website because I will be announcing dates in the upcoming weeks. I'm still writing for the blogs and magazines and honing my skills in that department too. Its been a great addition to my music to be able to write about something I love. I have some other behind the scenes ventures i'm exploring too.\n\nWhat are your fave albums ever?\n\nI can't narrow this down, I would be kidding myself if I said I could. Some of my favorite albums ever are:\n\n Notorious B.I.G- Life after Death\n Busta Rhymes- E.L.E\n Wu Tang- Forever\n Lauryn Hill- Miseducation of Lauryn Hill\n Miss E Elliot- So Addictive\n DMX- It's Dark and Hell is Hot\n Jay-Z Reasonable Doubt\n Nas- Illmatic\n Bone Thugs n Harmony - Creeping On a Come Up\n Ruff Ryders- Ryde Or Die Vol 1...Just to name a few that really stuck with me over the years and that aren't as obvious. My all-time collection usually includes albums that changed the game in some way with their release. They either change the way we see something, or set a tone of some sort.\n\nDo you perform live? Describe how you approach a live show.\n\nPerforming live is really important in music. You have to do it. I do it and even at my first show, I have never been shy. I get on stage and nothing else matters to me but performing. My approach to a show is to give the best performance I can. Not all venues are going to be the best venue, not all are going to have a great sound system and be packed. I just get up there and have a good time and I try my best to connect with the audience and give them a good idea of who I am.\n\nWhere can the people find you?\n\nAnywhere on the web you can find me at itsvenomiss:\n\nTwitter.com/itsvenomiss\nInstagram.com/itsvenomiss\nFacebook.com/itsvenomiss\nsoundcloud.com/itsvenomiss\nand Venomissworld.com.\nfor booking email bookvenomiss@gmail.com \n\nDo you have any shoutouts? Shoutout to everyone involved in this project. From engineers to studios to team Venomiss who keeps my weave on straight and my calendar organized, many thanks! Shoutout Team Tory always, My family and friends, Jersey Sound Labs, Podium Muzik, Agent Midi, Clipsmoke, Scooby, Huskee, Fiyyah, Gab, Dobie...

Also, he's possibly the coolest guy ever, and I'm personally obsessed with his hip-hop focused research. The sheer detail of his work is amazingly entertaining to explore.\n\nHe originally came to my attention when I was perusing Reddit and stumbled upon his hip-hop vocabulary project. Essentially he analyzed the first 35,000 lyrics of various American hip-hop artists and established a hierarchy based on the artists use of varying vocabulary that sparked much conversation – and debate. There were a few surprises, and a few confirmations (like DMX having the lowest vocabulary of those analyzed). Some artists, such as Biggie Smalls, weren't able to be analyzed, as they didn't have enough recorded material.\n\nI asked Matt how he conceived this insanely interesting concept:\n\n\"This was orginally going to be a collaboration with another media company. We were throwing around ideas, and this is the one we landed on. I had been learning a python framework called NLTK, which is for language processing. The first chapter of the manual for NLTK is on measuring the unique number of tokens (words) in a body of text. I just adopted this approach for the hip hop lyrics data set.\"\n\nUnderstandably this level of hip-hop nerdery broke the internet. As Matt explained, \"adding quantitative data to lyricism isn't common, so it was exciting to have this as a discussion point in hip hop. The biggest surprises were that the data validated a lot of my assumptions: artists who were more experimental with their lyrics ended up using a wider vocabulary (e.g., Outkast)\". How do you top a project with this much cool factor?\n\n\"Producers understand the minutia – the exact note at the exact millisecond that creates an interesting beat. I wish that more people understood this process and gift.\"\n\nMatt's latest project is Sample Stitch, an interactive (responsive) web experience that allows users to recreate beats by Dilla, Kanye and 9th Wonder using all the original elements. He's broken the songs into individual samples, and assigned all the samples to different keyboard keys. Essentially this allows users to use their keyboards like a classic MPC. The result? A new found appreciation for the difficulty, and intricacy of legit hip-hop production. What inspired this project? Matt explains: \"there was this project called Patatap that used a computer keyboard to trigger sounds. I thought that this was genius because a computer keyboard is a native instrument for most people - we can play it naturally in the same way a musician approaches a piano.\"\n\nIt's sheer dopeness hasn't gone unnoticed.\n\nThat's just the tip of the iceberg. His other work includes an in depth look at the cultural influence and nuances of Outkast, and historic analysis of the use of the word \"Shorty\" – and both are must-reads for any real hip-hop head. When talking to Noisy (re: Sample Stitch) Matt explained that he was, bottom line, trying to \"break the Internet again\". With this level of ingenuity, I doubt this is the last time that he'll do just that!\n\nIf you have yet to explore his work, be sure to visit his web-site.",

From it's \"costumey\" beginnings, to its adoption of Adidas and gold chains – a style we still pull from today – it's always been important to look the part.

I recently spoke to David about the brand's resurgence. Check out the interview below.\n\nTell us a bit about yourself.\n\nMy name is Dave; I grew up in NYC in the late 80s/early 90s and Troop was one of my favorite brands. I have vivid memories of LL Cool J endorsing and wearing the brand, as well as my favorite artists of that time. It was marketed as a hip-hop brand and was the first brand to do so. The shoes weren't marketed as athletic shoes; they were just meant more for fashion, and I think that was part of the reason it took off.\n\nCan you talk about the legacy that Troop has in the landscape of hip-hop?\n\nTroop was an important part of the golden era of the genre, as it exemplified the power hip-hop had to inspire an entire brand.

Today his old original signature products go for big money on eBay. Many other artists in that period wore the brand as well, like Stetsasonic and Marley Marl from the Juice Crew. In 2006, Nelly obtained the license for Troop apparel and brought it back to the market for a short period.\n\n Can you describe the circumstances that led Troop Sport going bankrupt?\n\nI was only about 9 or 10 when the brand died down, but from what I heard there were a lot of bad business decisions combined with unfounded rumors, and changing tastes of the consumer that lead to the brand dying out by the early 90s in America; however, Troop lasted longer in Europe than here surprisingly and had a strong run into the mid 90s. Today there are still a large number of Troop collectors from overseas.\n\n Why have you decided to bring the brand back?\n\nI decided to bring the brand back because I felt it would fit in well in the current marketplace given the current 80s/90s retro popularity for both shoes and fashion. It's important that the product and brand stay true to the originals.\n\n What products can we look forward to?\n\nWe'll be debuting the footwear, starting with the Pro Edition Mid and Ice Lamb Low, in mid to late April in stores across the USA such as Villa, Jimmy Jazz, Dr.Jays and others – as well as online at worldoftroop.com. We had a limited retro leather jacket for sale at a few stores in NYC and Philadelphia the past winter, and it sold very well. In the future, we will be expanding the apparel line as well.\n\nGood fashion never goes out of style!",

    "title": "Crowd Sourcing Platforms = Independent Music 2.0",
    "content": "Now we are here to collaborate with YOU, humanoid, on the most exciting project we’ve ever done.\n\n– De La Soul\n\nYesterday I received an email from De La Soul [I'm on their mailing list] informing me that they would be releasing their first album in a decade. It's currently available for preorder on Kickstarter in digital, and physical format. Tiered levels of support come with perks, such as De La Soul USB keys, shoes and limited edition shirts. Needless to say, I'm excited to get my copy of the album in the mail, and review here for all of you.\n\nIt seems like many artists are finding themselves on platforms like Kickstarter (and indigogo) these days. Some notable projects have included Domingo's Big Pun EP, and Ras Kass's A.D.I.D.A.S project. Let's face it, independent music sales isn't easy, and the production of an album is (generally) far from free. Kickstarter campaigns really make an artist vulnerable, but can also help them gauge the loyalty of their fanbase, and actual demand for their music. Allowing fans to be a part of your process and know that their money is positively benefitting the actual production of your music is a valuable connection to make. \n\nIt's this type of platform that has record labels scrambling. Kickstarter (and others) has unwittingly created a platform for musicians to sell music and keep 100% of the take, minus any personal overhead and nominal handling fee of course. My thought is that we may see that change in the future. Perhaps a Kickstarter for musicians, that finds a way to generate more revenue for the company. But for the time being, it's an amazing outlet for acts like De La Soul, and up and coming acts such as Lil'Dicky to positively exploit growing fan bases, and loyal followers in a way that simply posting music for sale on services like Bandcamp can't replicate.. \n\nMaybe instead of artist trying to change the face of music history with streaming music services, they should more intimately and authentically connect with their fans and produce a crowd sourced project.

It's currently available for preorder on Kickstarter in digital, and physical format. Tiered levels of support come with perks, such as De La Soul USB keys, shoes and limited edition shirts. Needless to say, I'm excited to get my copy of the album in the mail, and review here for all of you.\n\nIt seems like many artists are finding themselves on platforms like Kickstarter (and indigogo) these days. Some notable projects have included Domingo's Big Pun EP, and Ras Kass's A.D.I.D.A.S project. Let's face it, independent music sales isn't easy, and the production of an album is (generally) far from free. Kickstarter campaigns really make an artist vulnerable, but can also help them gauge the loyalty of their fanbase, and actual demand for their music. Allowing fans to be a part of your process and know that their money is positively benefitting the actual production of your music is a valuable connection to make. \n\nIt's this type of platform that has record labels scrambling. Kickstarter (and others) has unwittingly created a platform for musicians to sell music and keep 100% of the take, minus any personal overhead and nominal handling fee of course. My thought is that we may see that change in the future. Perhaps a Kickstarter for musicians, that finds a way to generate more revenue for the company. But for the time being, it's an amazing outlet for acts like De La Soul, and up and coming acts such as Lil'Dicky to positively exploit growing fan bases, and loyal followers in a way that simply posting music for sale on services like Bandcamp can't replicate.. \n\nMaybe instead of artist trying to change the face of music history with streaming music services, they should more intimately and authentically connect with their fans and produce a crowd sourced project. Just saying. This is the wave!\n\nhttps://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1519102394/de-la-souls-new-album\nIf you want to grab a copy of that new De La Soul, you have 29 days and counting!",

Welcome to the second instalment of Playing 8 Questions With, where we bring you a quick Q&A with a curated up & coming artist. This week we talk to Tha Soloist, a dope cat I'm currently bumping out of Jersey. Give this cat an ear!\n\nIntroduce yourself.\n\nHey, I go by Tha Soloist. The name has many different meanings. You'll figure it out one day. Just know that it's deep. I'm a deep artist. I'm a weirdo. I like that.\n\nHow did you get involved in music?\n\nMy dad stuck a needle in his arm, so I chose to put the needle on the record instead. Both get you high, but I love music. I'm glad I didn't go that route. Around 94'. Like Method Man said, \"I came to bring the pain.\" That's my whole style. Blues Hop.\n\nWho are some of your influences? \n\nEveryone influences me in a way, but if I had to say...it would be Bob Dylan, MF DOOM, Wu-Tang, Nas, Billy Joel. I don't discriminate. I love it all. Even Jay-Z and Em influenced me.Back then it was Big Daddy Kane, Biz, Rakim, G Rap. The greats.\n\nTell me about your music.\n\nMy music is all about FEELING. I want everyone to relate, you know what I mean? Everyone can't relate to being rich. Everyone can't relate to being poor, but EVERYONE can relate to feeling down at some point. Going through dark times. That's my music. I don't always talk about the sad shit, but yeah, that's my avenue. I'm a poet that \nwrites tragedies. \n\nTell me about your sound.\n\nMy sound is the sound of the soul expressing itself to the fullest. When you hear my music you know right away. You know the SOUL is in there. Once I get a beat I write to it.I work off of inspiration. I'm spontaneous. I don't like to hold on to something. Once I make the music I want you to hear it while it's still fresh. Nobody wants someold moldy bread. I give it to you while it's still hot out the oven. \n\nTalk to us about your latest project. Who did you work with?\n\nMy last project only had one feature. Tone Liv. Other than that it was all me. The producers I worked with did a great job. Vic Grimes, Giallo Point, Mister Dige. He's one the illest. UK cat. I also got a few joints with my boy Sultan Mir; A GENIUS. The last LP was called REP THE THINKER. It speaks for itself. I represent the thinker,and my fans do too. \n\nWhat are your fave albums ever?\n\nWu-Tang Forever, Tupac's Greatest Hits, Born Like This (DOOM) and a few others.\n\nDo you perform live? Describe how you approach a live show.\n\nYes, I perform live. I just get on stage and do my thing. I let the passion control me. I don't do too many songs either. My memory sucks. But that's okay I guess. Three tracks is enough. I usually do an acapella before or after.\n\nWhere can people find you?\n\nGoogle Tha Soloist. I got a YouTube channel, SoundCloud, my Facebook name is Angel Vergara. Hit me up whenever. I'm approachable. Don't spell it like this: THE SOLOIST. I'm Tha Soloist. \n\nAny shoutouts?\n\nShoutout to BBZ Darney, we got a track out now. Shoutout to the aspiring artists. Believe in yourself. I love you all. Peace! My new LP Daily Allowance coming Late April.",

    "content": "I call it the cool box, like you know when people say don’t put me in a box? Well, I don’t mind being in this box if all I got to do is do what I did in the beginning.\n\n– Saukrates\n\nThe Canadian music scene has come a long way – and that’s no exaggeration. Artists like Drake and P.Reign are repping the city of Toronto globally, much to the chagrin of many World Star Hip-Hop trolls. Contrary to popular belief, the hip-hop scene in the city has been thriving since, well, forever. Few artists have stood the test of time better than rapper and producer Saukrates, a member of the famed Circle crew, which includes the likes of Kardinal Offishall, amongst others.\n\nHe’s been around the scene, and then some. His gold, award-winning debut album featured Common, Heltah Skeltah, Xzibit and more. He’s a member of Redman’s Gilla House camp and was once signed to Def Jam records. He’s produced music for the likes of Nas and performed on stages across the nation – and across the border. He’s a seasoned, well-respected vet, and he was kind enough to chat with me about his career, his latest project, Amani, and more.\n\nCheck the interview below.\n\nLet’s talk about how you got into hip-hop.\n\nI think all of us started out as fans you know – just fans of hip hop. I think maybe around maybe ’86-’87, when LL, Rakim, EPMD, and Big Daddy Kane came out is when I locked in. I already had an interest in the arts, because I grew up playing classical violin, so I always had an interest in performing music. Me and my next door neighbour Lock Jaw, who is featured on the B-side of my first single called  We used just to freestyle on the basketball court, and then one day we decided just to write it all down.\n\nI took it seriously when I got an opportunity at a summer program called Fresh Arts. That’s where I met Kardinal Offishall, Jully Black, Marvel, Solitaire, Win-K – basically the whole beginning of the Circle Crew. That’s how I got started.\n\nLooking at  – that album was crazy ahead of its time. It had OC on it, Common, Pharoahe Monch, Xzibit…do you think you got the respect you deserved off that album?\n\nI do think I got the respect I deserved off that album. Meaning to say that I went gold in Canada – and gold back then meant you had to do 50,000+. We got nominated for a Juno, got nominated for a couple \n\nof MMVA’s, toured across the country, and even got some US radio play. Also, the quality of the music has lasted the test of time – like I never stop hearing about that album. I think that’s the most important thing to be said about that album. It’s the fact that everything that was done at that time hadn’t been done before by a Canadian MC or producer. So it broke ground and let a lot of cats know that we can do it. You know what I mean? It was a motivational piece, and we got a few cool surprises too like Money Or Love landed on the Boiler Room Soundtrack for example. My friend and brother from another mother, Mick Karen (he’s now head of A&R at Warner Music) helped put out the underground tapes in the US. We did an alternate cover in Canada. You know the American cover of the underground tapes, the comic book cover? Mike Shinoda did that. He did that like three years before Linkin Park blew up. So that record just helped do so many things, on so many levels. I still do off a lot of those songs; people request them. It also got me signed to Def Jam! Once we put that out, and Redman heard Money Or Love, I was on a plane a few days later. It’s amazing how some music can stretch over your lifetime and keep coming back. I think that’s what keeps Paul MaCartney going [laughs].\n\nWhat’s your take on the Canadian scene?\n\nIt has changed a lot, but as much as it’s changed it’s stayed the same. For instance, there have always been hungry MCs out there, and it’s just more popular now. I mean, the internet has changed everything for all lines of business and not just music. So, with that being said the Toronto scene has been able to grow (exponentially) without the help of major labels, which is how we [Canadian artists] used to operate in the past. It almost seems as though it’s come full circle, but there is more exposure now for people who didn’t necessarily have a voice before. Now it is like, you can post something, shoot it with your camera and if it is quality people will find you.\n\nLet’s talk about your latest release Amani.\n\nWell, for me it’s a breath of fresh air, and another opportunity to put out music under the name Saukrates as an emcee because I’m also a producer. The quality of the music is so high – it feels like I’ve come full circle as I went back to the roots. I'm delivering what people expect from the Saukrates brand. I call it the cool box, like you know when people say don’t put me in a box? Well, I don’t mind being in this box if all I got to do is do what I did in the beginning. So it’s a breath of air for me because it is right back to the basics, and I’ve learnt so since I was seventeen years old, so the lyrics to me feel even more potent. We’re having a good time with it, and the recognition is coming back, it’s like wow. It’s like the Dr Dre phase. You know, I looked up to hI'm and Quincy Jones, and the way they can stay quiet, disappear, then come back like nothing had changed and that’s what this Amani EP represents for me. It’s only the first installation in the Season Two campaign.\n\nWhat’s going to be the next installment?\n\nWell, the next instalment we did was a double-sided single, Elixer. The second chapter is on its way [Amani was chapter one]. The features on it are great – Sonreal is back. I always got to call on Kardi, we always find a way to make it work for each other, and you know, we got other producers coming in, carrying the load with me.\n\n*In the clip below, Saukrates discusses his production & feature work.\n\nAre you still connected with Gilla House?\n\nYep! Redman is more of a big brother to me than a business associates. So, even as Def Jam faded for us, Redman and I maintained a family connection – and we genuinely care for each other’s careers. So, we share music, talk shit, and when he comes around, he stays at my home with my family. He hangs with my wife, my son and I,  just having a good time.\n\nGilla House connections that will never go away, we’re a family first!",

    "content": "Each month, we here at Above Average Hip-Hop sift through all of our submissions and choose one lucky album to review on the site. This month I can across the Summerville, South Carolina, trio Savage Souls. Comprised of Kae G The Original Seed, Fortune the Iron Mic Mangler and DJ Icirus, the crew reminds me of lots of people I like, so I'll try my best to sum it up properly. They sound like a mix of Big Pun, with a side of Chris Rivers, Necro (sans the grossness), Ra The Rugged Man and Canadian group Swollen Members – all lovingly baked together into a plate of hip-hop goodness.\n\nTheir latest EP, which I listened to a few times, is Sword Gang – a 5-track appetizer for their forthcoming EP (more on that later). I have to note it's self-produced by Kae G, which is a good look. Right from the jump, it's a dope listen. The title track establishes the flow, kicking off with a dope sample and some cuts before it just goes off. My personal opinion, the two spitters go hardest on the tracks, Colossus and Beyond Average. The beats are full of dope samples, and compliment the artists very well. They've clearly found a lane that works well for them.\n\nThe main drawback from the project is that it's sonically one-dimensional. If you like it, you'll love it. If you're on the fence, you won't find anything here to sway you; although, I'll admit that I'm slightly ignorant to their full catalogue of work. It would be dope to hear them try some different sound-beds out.\n\nOveralls I like em'. Samples, cuts and a pause-play tape feel that I can't help but have a soft spot for. Savage Souls are dope, and definitely deserve a few spins.\n\nThe team kicked off a year long initiative to release a total of four EPs that will culminate into a debut album in 2015. Sword Gang was their second, and their forthcoming EP Invasion should be out this summer. you can learn more about them here.",

They sound like a mix of Big Pun, with a side of Chris Rivers, Necro (sans the grossness), Ra The Rugged Man and Canadian group Swollen Members – all lovingly baked together into a plate of hip-hop goodness.\n\nTheir latest EP, which I listened to a few times, is Sword Gang – a 5-track appetizer for their forthcoming EP (more on that later). I have to note it's self-produced by Kae G, which is a good look. Right from the jump, it's a dope listen. The title track establishes the flow, kicking off with a dope sample and some cuts before it just goes off. My personal opinion, the two spitters go hardest on the tracks, Colossus and Beyond Average. The beats are full of dope samples, and compliment the artists very well. They've clearly found a lane that works well for them.\n\nThe main drawback from the project is that it's sonically one-dimensional. If you like it, you'll love it. If you're on the fence, you won't find anything here to sway you; although, I'll admit that I'm slightly ignorant to their full catalogue of work. It would be dope to hear them try some different sound-beds out.\n\nOveralls I like em'. Samples, cuts and a pause-play tape feel that I can't help but have a soft spot for. Savage Souls are dope, and definitely deserve a few spins.\n\nThe team kicked off a year long initiative to release a total of four EPs that will culminate into a debut album in 2015. Sword Gang was their second, and their forthcoming EP Invasion should be out this summer. you can learn more about them here.",

That's a generalization, but you get the point!\n\n[preface: I'm referring to mixtapes created by artists, not the coined phrase for consumer bootlegs]\n\nMixtapes have a long history and tradition. It may be hard for younger heads to remember, but they used to be actual tapes – and to top it off they were actually mixed. I'll pause while you compose yourself. You either had an actual DJ mixing actual records together, or there was a pause/play element used for those who didn't have their music on wax or own decks. That eventually evolved into unreleased songs simply being \"arranged\". This evolution gave rise to a breed of DJ that simply arranged and played songs, rather than actual mixing – leading to some confusion about the vital role a skilled DJ can play in the culture. As someone who is obsessed with actual mixing, I kind of think you're missing out by not having your music actually mixed by a real DJ. The barrier to entry, which was pressing vinyl, is now equalized due to the likes of Serato. No excuses.\n\nAnyways, I digress. Are mixtapes dead? Well, plenty of artists have either created or lived careers in the circuit, like 50 Cent, Lupe Fiasco, Dipset, and Mac Miller; however, the format is flooded. Sites like DatPiff post like \"a million\" mixtapes a day, many of questionable quality (all around). The only barrier to entry that current exists is that you can record songs – original beats not necessary – and make a cover of some sort. Mixtapes, as far as I can tell, have almost digressed into a collection of songs that artists aren't willing to label as an official EP or album. Of course that's assuming it's even an official tape.\n\nEssentially my point is that the term has become polluted...kind of like the concept that rap and hip-hop aren't the same thing. One of the main elements of hip-hop has been watered down to an extreme, which I find troubling. Maybe it's time to either re-name, re-format or create a barrier to entry into the mixtape game? Maybe force an artist to create a respectable demo/album first? Maybe a stricter curation process?\n\nJust food for though. Let's take a moment and salute actual DJ's who create actual mixtapes – and the next generation of turntable warriors.",

    "content": "The 90's hip-hop sound had a very specific sound/feel to it. It's often duplicated, and many artists claI'm to be \"bringing it back\"...but it's not that simple. The music we grew up on was driven less by money and overt commercial intervention. It was motivated by the love of the culture. The sound that artists are trying to duplicate is comprised of gritty MPC beats, record pops and above all bars – unadulterated street hip-hop. The kind of shit that you heard on warm summer nights on college radio shows across your respective nation.\n\nEvery once in a while I come across an artist that takes me there, and I consider it my constant duty as a \"curator of the real\" to bring them to your attention. Let me introduce you to East Koast – a Harlem rapper with a super interesting background in the industry. His roots run deep, like Dallas Austin deep (literally). His cousin is Mr. Malik from the famed 90s group Illegal, and he came up as a background figure in the game, helping in the development of some seminal tracks for the duo – and others. While living in Decatur with Illegal (Malik & Jamal) and the late Lisa Left-Eye Lopez, of the trio TLC, East Koast learned first hand about the ins and outs of the game. Yes, you read that last sentence correctly. Left Eye, as he (and others) describe, handled putting the duo (Illegal) together:\n\nLisa Lopez (R.I.P) had the idea to put them (Illegal) together once she had heard from Treach (Naughty By Nature) that Malik was as mature as he (Jamal) was. Malik was a spitter and had won all types of contests in South Carolina where our family is from. Long story short, Left Eye came and picked us up at the waffle house, and we lived in a duplex hotel room for about two weeks before we shopped for a home.  We finally moved into a five-room house with a garage. I stayed downstairs, and Malik's room was right across from Left eye. \n\nCrazy right?\n\nI've been jamming his latest project with Lewis Parker, MK Ultra (Operation Hypnosis), on repeat all day. It's ten tracks long and features no filler, just straight up hip-hop – seemingly void of time markers. It features 16's from the likes of El Da Sensei, John Robinson and Shabaam Sahdeeq (amongst others). What instantly drew me in was the uniqueness of his voice. His beat selection is perfect. His subject matter varies, and never comes off as forced or dated. Stand out joints for me were L.A to New York, Hustlin Junkie and Superior MC's (with El and Shabaam).\n\nWhen asked about his approach for the album, Eastkoast explained:\n\n\"The approach was rooted around (the concept of) mind control, and how every \"top shelf\" artist has no identity. We thought of society as a whole, and how slavery was swept under the rug – as if it never happened.\"\n\nIn short, I loved this album... I'm intrigued by hI'm as an artist, and I'll continue to champion his music here. Be sure to follow East Koast on Twitter!\n\nEarly.",

Done – you'll love this album. That was easy. [drops mic].\nJust kidding, but it felt that easy when I was taking in Fly International Luxurious Arts, the latest album by the Shaolin heavy-hitter. It's 13 tracks, and has dope features from some industry heavyweights like Melanie Fiona, Rick Ross and more; although, It also doesn't leave any comfort zones – or really innovate in any way. What is does deliver is bars, dope production, and a reminder of what made us love hI'm in the first place.   \n\nRight out of the gate, Rae sounds as hungry as ever – as does Ghost, who is featured on the first joint, 4 In The Morning. He pretty much just knocks em' out from there. I Got Money with A$AP Rocky, Wall To Wall with French Montana, the infectious F.I.L.A World with 2 Chainz all bang. Even the inevitable female focused joint with Estelle comes off nice. Standouts for me were Nautilus and the retrospective Heated Nights.\n\nThis doesn't play out as an album that will necessarily win Rae any awards or new fans; not that it matters. Rae has a (large) dedicated fan base. This album will keep them all happy. Listen, some \"street\" artists wear thin over the years, but some artists can just never do wrong. The whole Wu has that ability, Kool G Rap has that ability – and as a solo artist, Rae has that appeal in my opinion. If he and ghost were 90 years old and STILL rapping about coke, money and retrospective street shit, I'd totally rock with it. \n\nThis album is a must listen for all Wu and Chef fans. It's fitting that he drops some quality music for the summer leading up the 20th anniversary of his \"street-hop\" blueprint Only Built For Cuban Linx. He sounds fresh as ever.",

    "content": "Every month, we here at Above Average Hip-Hop choose one unsigned artist to profile/review. This month I was put on to a young brother by the name of Kid Cubicle hailing from New Jersey. His latest release, Mind The Gap, hit the interwebs a month ago and really deserves some more shine.\n\nWith obvious influences from movies and English culture (among a whack of other stuff), this album has a certain thing that's hard to put my finger on. It's introspective, lyrical, personal and extroverted all at the same time. From the deep Monsters in the Attic, in which he discusses his battle with anxiety and hypochondriasis, to the jazzy straight-up 90's hip-hop vibe of Just Getting Started, it's a straight up interesting listen.\n\nWe wanted to learn more about Kid Cubicle, so we sat with hI'm and asked hI'm a few questions.\n\nHow did you get into music?\n\nI grew up in a house with 10 people in it, so music of all genres was always playing. I got into hip hop as a kid because my pops was trying to be a DJ, so he had basically every dope CD from the 90s. As a really little kid, I'd steal all his CDs and just listen to them. From It was Written and Ready to Die to Fu Schnickens and SWV [laughs]. I got my start in music without really thinking about it. My high school friends and I would just battle, and do shitty competitions in people's basements. I did that throughout high school and got good enough to battle at different colleges in the North Jersey/NY area. I joined a hip hop band 2 years after that, called the \"Sly Fox Gentlemen's Club\". We did a bunch of shows in NY and were pretty awesome. We broke up pretty quickly and I went solo.\n\nWho are your influences?\n\nMy influences from a rap perspective would be: Kanye, Mos Def, Andre 3K, Eminem and Jay-Z. My biggest influence would probably be Residente from the Puerto Rican rap band named \"Calle 13\". They started out as a Reggaeton band, but weren't afraid of experimenting with different sounds, and that's something I really try to strive for. To not be afraid of doing new/different things even if it doesn't always work.  I'm influenced by all kinds of other music too, from jazz, blues, shit from the 60s, alternative and indie bands — I try to draw from all of that. I'm also equally as influenced by movies as I am by music, so that's why I'm always making pop culture/movie references in my raps a lot of the time. Ideally, I'd like my songs to feel like movies in your head when you listen to them.\n\nTell me about your new album... How long did take to record? What was your process like?\n\nThis album took way too fucking long to make [laughs]. I started working on it 2012, but took a break to focus on school. I started writing the album again in London; that's where I got the idea for the title of the album Mind the Gap. When you take the Subway there they always say \"Mind the Gap\" because there's a huge gap between the train and the platform... I guess a lot of people fall or something. The name stuck with me. The album wrestles with growing up, and overcoming the fear that comes along with that. The main producer I worked with on this album was my homie Kevin Birk, who was the guy who put together that band I was in for a few months back in'09. He's a classically trained musician who makes some fucking crazy ass beats..so good. Sidebar: Mind the Gap is also a perfect album name because I used to work at the Gap [laughs] on some Kanye Spaceship shit.\n\nWhat's up next for you?\n\nWhat's next? I'm working with a really good filmmaker from Puerto Rico to shoot a video for I Don't Need to Rap in a few weeks. I'm also trying to get my grandfather in that video, which would make it the illest video ever. Now that the record is done, I'd like to get back to doing shows in and around the NY area... It's been a while and I'm excited to finally perform these songs that I've been locked away working on (off and on) for so long.\n\nWhat are your fave albums ever?\n\nAhhhhhh man, that's tough! Favorite albums ever off the top: College Dropout, Marshall Mathers LP, MultiViral (by Calle 13), Rage Against the Machine, The Love Below, Black on Both Sides, The Blueprint and any salsa record from Willie Colon and Hector levoe.\n\n What's your take on the indie scene?\n\nThe indie scene is everything now. I'm not even sure if there is a \"major\" scene anymore. There's a crazy amount of really talented people doing awesome shit (I can't even keep track) – and (now) they actually have a shot at building audiences and reaching people, which is really cool. I'm not one of those artists who gets mad when it seems like everyone raps now... That's fine, I want everyone to rap! [laughs] Not really, but I feel like if someone is compelled to make music, rap, or any kind of art, and they do it from an authentic and real place, then I fuck with it. I don't have to like their art or be a fan of it, but I applaud their effort, because I know it's not easy to put yourself out there.\n\nCheck out Kid Cubicle's Mind The Gap album below!",

His new album, STS x RJD2, which is exactly what it sounds like, is admittedly my first introduction to him. Good first impression.\n\nI knew he was from Philly, but wasn't that shocked to hear that he was born/raised in Atlanta. He has a southern twang that at times puts me in mind of Andre 3000 – but his delivery is very east coast. This 12 shot album is a lot of things: melodic, soulful and surprisingly bar heavy.\n\nSome immediate tracks that jump out at me after my first few listens are the soulful Doin It Right, which starts the project off, the super clever Trunk Of My Computer and of course the track that brought STS to my attention originally 420. What really impressed me was the album closer Fuck With That, which is a flip of Jay-Z's pre-fame gem I Can't Get With That.\n\nRJD2 is amazingly talented, with a track record of critically acclaimed heat rocks. STS definitely benefits from working exclusively with one producer. The project has a consistent tone/sound that maintains its momentum from top to bottom. The result is an album that isn't a chore to listen to in its entirety.\n\nSTS and RJD2 have put together one of, in all honesty, the best projects I've heard this year [so far].

    "content": "A career in the music industry can go one of two ways: easy or hard. Either you have a Drake “struggle” or you really live that life – and that means every sense of the word. Enter Constant Deviants, the Baltimore duo of M.I. and DJ/Producer CUTT, who have definitely seen ups and downs on the path to their latest release, Avant Garde, currently available on their own imprint SIX2SIX. Back in 2000, M.I. signed a solo deal with Arista Records, with Cutt aiding in production while solidifying his career as a DJ and engineer. Unfortunately a few snags led the duo to return to the drawing board and ultimately return to their roots.\n\nI had the pleasure of getting an advance copy of their 2nd full length LP, Avant Garde, and it was pleasure to listen to. Right from the title cut, the album sets the tone. It’s organic, rough, gritty, polished and reeks of experience. With CUTT handling all of the production himself, the album is coherent sonically, and really brings out the best in M.I., who’s bars shine over my fave joints on the project: M’s for Millennium, which is a clever spin on alphabet raps, I’m Still Up, which is my new late night anthem and It’s Like That, which features the album's sole guest, Aye Wun. Another stand out was the track Breathing’ – a track that put me in the mindset of mid-nineties Beatnuts (production-wise). The album effortlessly carries the 90’s hip-hop aesthetic – right down to the record pops.\n\nWe recently had a chance to talk to the guys about their project, their new movie and more. Check the interview below:\n\nCan you start by telling me how guys got involved in music?\n\nM.I. - My whole family are musicians, so I grew up around music. My pops was a jazz musician. He played the trumpet, so I guess the apple didn't fall far from the tree\n\nCUTT - Same here. My father plays piano and guitar. We always had a piano in the house and a decent record collection. I started DJing when I was 11. I always wanted to be involved with music somehow.\n\nHow did Constant Deviants come together?\n\nM.I.- We met at a mutual friend's college. CUTT was djing a party and I got on the mic. By the end of the night we were in the studio working on a demo\n\nAvant Garde is your fourth studio album, what's different this time around?\n\nM.I. - I would say that every album is different in essence, because the moment is different, but it's still your classic Constant Deviants music. We did try to bridge the gap from old to new on this one\n\nCUTT - With Avant Garde we had a specific direction we wanted to go in. Bringing the classic era sound into the present.\n\nYou guys have been busy lately – tell me about Swiss Banks.\n\nM.I.- That's an album I did wth our Swiss cousins SWC Records. Video director JPowell and I felt it would be a dope project to do a movie for, so it just kind of evolved. We're actually working on our second movie this summer entitled Six to Six. Gotta be versatile.\n\nHow was that experience – are you planning any more films?\n\nM.I. - I'm falling in love with making films – like I am with music at this point. I'm living a double life [laughs].\n\nWhat are your thoughts on the current hip-hop scene?\n\nM.I. - Hip hop is what it has always been. You have mainstream and underground. Me personally, I have respect for both and think it's great for the culture. That's what makes it \"hip hop\".\n\nCUTT - I have no problem with the current scene. Everything is not for everybody. I'm just glad there still is a scene. It gives us an opportunity to do what we do. \n\nWhat do you guys have coming up?\n\nM.I. - We have another LP in the works entitled L&L. We'll keep that a secret for now! I also have 2 solo projects in the works.\n\nCUTT - Already started working on our new project. Also just wrapped up producing an album titled Groceries for extended Six2Six crew member Aye Wun – a dope MC from Queens, NY. He's featured on the Avant Garde album track called It's Like That.\n\nAny last words or shout outs?\n\nM.I. - Shouts to John at UrbanElite, shouts to Shareef HakI'm at Black Fist Promotions, shouts to Set Rule at Six2Six Records and everyone involved thus far in helping us move forward. Shouts to people like yourself for the outlet and the opportunity for exposure. \n\nCUTT - Peace to all who support us.",

The album effortlessly carries the 90’s hip-hop aesthetic – right down to the record pops.\n\nWe recently had a chance to talk to the guys about their project, their new movie and more. Check the interview below:\n\nCan you start by telling me how guys got involved in music?\n\nM.I. - My whole family are musicians, so I grew up around music. My pops was a jazz musician. He played the trumpet, so I guess the apple didn't fall far from the tree\n\nCUTT - Same here. My father plays piano and guitar. We always had a piano in the house and a decent record collection. I started DJing when I was 11. I always wanted to be involved with music somehow.\n\nHow did Constant Deviants come together?\n\nM.I.- We met at a mutual friend's college. CUTT was djing a party and I got on the mic. By the end of the night we were in the studio working on a demo\n\nAvant Garde is your fourth studio album, what's different this time around?\n\nM.I. - I would say that every album is different in essence, because the moment is different, but it's still your classic Constant Deviants music. We did try to bridge the gap from old to new on this one\n\nCUTT - With Avant Garde we had a specific direction we wanted to go in. Bringing the classic era sound into the present.\n\nYou guys have been busy lately – tell me about Swiss Banks.\n\nM.I.- That's an album I did wth our Swiss cousins SWC Records. Video director JPowell and I felt it would be a dope project to do a movie for, so it just kind of evolved. We're actually working on our second movie this summer entitled Six to Six. Gotta be versatile.\n\nHow was that experience – are you planning any more films?\n\nM.I. - I'm falling in love with making films – like I am with music at this point. I'm living a double life [laughs].\n\nWhat are your thoughts on the current hip-hop scene?\n\nM.I. - Hip hop is what it has always been. You have mainstream and underground. Me personally, I have respect for both and think it's great for the culture. That's what makes it \"hip hop\".\n\nCUTT - I have no problem with the current scene. Everything is not for everybody. I'm just glad there still is a scene. It gives us an opportunity to do what we do. \n\nWhat do you guys have coming up?\n\nM.I. - We have another LP in the works entitled L&L. We'll keep that a secret for now! I also have 2 solo projects in the works.\n\nCUTT - Already started working on our new project. Also just wrapped up producing an album titled Groceries for extended Six2Six crew member Aye Wun – a dope MC from Queens, NY. He's featured on the Avant Garde album track called It's Like That.\n\nAny last words or shout outs?\n\nM.I. - Shouts to John at UrbanElite, shouts to Shareef HakI'm at Black Fist Promotions, shouts to Set Rule at Six2Six Records and everyone involved thus far in helping us move forward. Shouts to people like yourself for the outlet and the opportunity for exposure. \n\nCUTT - Peace to all who support us.",

While driving the other day, a song came up my Spotify Shuffle that I hadn't heard in ages: Hey Young World by Slick Rick. The song was the third single off of Rick's debut album The Great Adventures and – above all – a breath of fresh air.\n\nHip-hop, which began primarily as an answer to gang violence in NYC (no need to argue its actual birthplace), had grown into the central voice of the (urban) people by the mid-late 80's. Although commercial influence had produced artists like Sugar Hill Gang, RUN DMC, Fat Boys – and a host of other artists with lighter subject matter – it also bred the opposite. Artists, like Public Enemy, were using the ghetto CNN to fight issues of race and social injustices; however, there was a gap. Young Slick Rick danced this line, often (but not always) favoring a humorous angle, married with his trademark storytelling flow.\n\nThe average (young) hip-hop head in NYC in the late 80's, early 90's lived through some arguably wild shit. 1989–1993 saw the highest crime rates in the history of the city, teen pregnancy levels were at an all-time high, and the effects of the crack epidemic were everywhere. This was the breeding ground of much of the golden era that hip-hop heads revere so much. It was also during this time that Slick Rick addressed the youth of the time with his classic record.\n\nThe song asked the youth to take make the most of their lives, reject the pressures of the streets, stay away from drugs and violence, and above all respect your parents. It was all done in a manner that didn't reek of cheese, like it might have if, say, Will Smith (or your parents) had made the same song. Slick Rick was relatable. He was one of them. Ironically, the very pressures he tried to steer the youth away from eventually swallowed up seven years of his life. In 1990, Rick shot his cousin and a bystander and spent time in Rikers.\n\nA few songs have tried to recreate the organic magic of this classic, most notably Nas's Impeach The President sampled. It would seem, though, that perhaps another Hey Young World is in order – especially considering the current temperament of our society. That young world that Rick was addressing is now grown up (at least physically). Most of us are struggling to bring up children in a whole new digital landscape, fraught with uncertainty, violence and disconnection.\n\nThe problem is; we can't do what Rick did. We aren't one of them. We're the old heads. We have to hope that not all of the voices of the younger generation are one dimensional. Maybe, some of our nagging influence sparks a golden age 2.0 as we venture into the future.\n\nNeed some inspiration?\n\nHere, I'll start:\n\nHey young world, the world is yours. Fight the power, strive to achieve positivity in all aspects of your life and attempt to stay connected with humans in a disconnected world branded as connected. I know not all of you will choose the \"right\" path, as I learned growing up, that's impossible – but there's no harm in following your heart. Oh, and respect your parents. \n\nI'll leave the logistics and rhyme scheme up to you, but you get the idea.",

    "content": "There's a certain unwritten formulaic magic that goes into the creation of a certified hip-hop \"anthem\". Making a hit record is hard enough! Hits tend to become forgotten at some point, especially amidst a sea of new hits. Anthems? Those last forever. Few rappers can stake claI'm to certified, undeniable anthems. Naughty By Nature can (Hip-Hop Hooray), as can M.O.P (Ante Up), and – of course – Harlem's own Black Rob.\n\nBlack Rob has had a career, and life, of incredible highs and humbling lows. In and out of jail at various points, Rob was a Bad Boy Records staple throughout their first two iterations: the Biggie, Lox, 112 era, and the \"Diddy\" era. It was during the latter that we first got the opportunity to get familiar with Rob and experience his epic smash-hit, Whoa. His debut album, Life Story, featured names like JLo (amongst others), and reached Platinum status.\n\nHe released one more album before doing a bid in 2006 that kept hI'm off the streets until 2010 – after which he released his first post-Bad Boy album on Duck Down Records. Unfortunately, the fast life caught up to Rob at the top of the year when he suffered a mild stroke. Luckily, he's recovered and is back at it with a new album.\n\nWe had an opportunity to chat with Rob, who shared his new album, a fond memory of Biggie Smalls and how the stroke changed his outlook on life. Whoa!\n\nHow did you originally get into hip-hop?\n\nWow… Well, I was fascinated with it from the jump. I started rhyming to myself, and I was nice at it, so I started taking it seriously.\n\nCan you describe your first time meeting Puffy?\n\nIt was very interesting. This dude I knew was cool with hI'm from school and took me to him. He asked me to rhyme – and I started rhyming and wouldn’t stop. From there history was in the making!\n\nIt’s been just about 20 years from the first time I heard you on the 112 Come See Me remix. Now, here you are with your 4th album, Genuine Article. Can you describe this album for us?\n\nThis album is very special. It’s the element of Hip-Hop that many have been hoping would come back to this industry. Lyrics juxtaposed with that boom bap sound! I speak on some real issues that many can relate too as well.\n\nThe album is unapologetically NEW YORK. What's your take on the current NY scene?\n\nThat’s what I know and do. Strictly New York flavor. No disrespect to anyone or any other place, but I can only be me and do what I know. Right now – the way I see it – New York is in a good place. It’s coming back to that New York sound, and these days the music is (once again) becoming more about the lyrical content.\n\nYour 2011 release Game Tested, Streets Approved was released on Duck Down, what prompted the jump to Slimstyle Records for this release?\n\nThat was a situation my manager Jemal “Jay” Mosley brought to my attention. There was an offer on the table that I felt was very beneficial to me, so I went for it.\n\nYou suffered a stroke at the top of the year. First, how are you feeling? Second, how did that affect your outlook on life?\n\nI’m good, thanks for asking. It opened my eyes, and let me know that I have to take better care of myself – and face the reality that I can’t do certain things I used to do when I was younger. What people don’t realize is that as an artist, we're on the road a lot and don’t eat or sleep as we should. We eat fast food, party, hit the studio, rinse and repeat. I had to change up my lifestyle.\n\nMay 21st was BIG's birthday. Do you have any fond memories of BIG you'd like to share with our readers?\n\nI have a few, but I’ll share this with you. One day, I was in the studio with Nas and Biggie doing a song for Mary J Blige. When we started going over our verses, which, by the way, he never wrote anything down on paper, he heard my joint and was like \"yo, B.R. this joint is for Mary.\" I was going so hard on the joint, and he was like, \"lighten up fam.\" That was a good day. I would love to hear that song right now.\n\nWhat can you tell us about Quas Amill and Box In One?\n\nBox In One is my label, along with my manager Jemal Mosley. Quas Amill is a beast – and his album is just about complete. We just have some fine tuning to do with it, and believe me when I tell you: he’s going to shock the world. He’s the reason you’re going to fall (back in) love with Hip-Hop.\n\nWhat’s next for Black Rob?\n\nWell right now, I’m currently filming for the reality show Come Back Kings along with Ed Lover, Mr. Cheeks, Do-It All, Treach, Lil Cease, Jamie O, June Balloon, Rashad, Horace Brown, and a few others. That will be airing on UPN (Channel 9) July 4th, 2015 at 12:30 AM EST.\n\nAny last words of wisdom for our readers?\n\nPurchase that Genuine Article album, and tune in to watch Come Back Kings. Take care of your health and be mindful that everything you do today may bite you in the ass tomorrow. Follow me on twitter and IG at @TheRealBlackRob.",

    "title": "Why I Like Troy Ave (Regardless of Album Sales)",
    "content": "It's a weird time in the history of hip-hop. The \"next-up\" generation of artists has been bred in a different climate. When you ask them about the old school, they mention names like Nelly and Young Joc – ouch! For this reason, many of the more \"seasoned\" (age wise) tend to, for lack of a better term, hate young hip-hop heads, and a bulk of the ultra-repetitive new brand of trap. Although, there are always exceptions to the rule. \n\nSome of the younger cats happened to have cool parents (like us) that made them explore the culture. The result is artists like Joey Badass and Bishop Nehru, who authentically sound like the golden era. Other new artists just happen to have that \"it\" factor that made audiences fall in love with hip-hop back in the day; above all, they can spit. Two examples of this are A$AP Rocky (and company) and the main subject of this article, Troy Ave.\n\nI've been listening to Troy for a while now. After his recent release, Major Without A Deal, I felt like I needed to get vocal about him, and why he's a good look.\n\nHe's unapologetically hip-hop, very NYC and 100% independent; and real independence isn't something all artists can claim.\n\nRemember his XXL Freshman cipher? He called out everyone else in the line-up for being a bunch of \"weirdos\". Rightfully so. In a sea of skinny jeans and funny accessories, he was rocking a mink and counting a stack of money while the others dropped their verses. How NYC is that? He's flashy, and no gimmicks at the same time. Is he cocky? Yes. Does he tell you that he's bringing NYC back too much, maybe – but that's hip-hop! It's a cocky, competitive landscape. I've seen plenty of journalists bash hI'm for the above two points, but he's continuing to thrive. Don't forget, hip-hop is an underdog sport.\n\nHe has a bit of a 50 sound, but honestly, he's a heavy hip-hop head from New York City. As if he wasn't at all influenced by 50 – he's the right age.

    "clean_content": "It's a weird time in the history of hip-hop. The \"next-up\" generation of artists has been bred in a different climate. When you ask them about the old school, they mention names like Nelly and Young Joc – ouch! For this reason, many of the more \"seasoned\" (age wise) tend to, for lack of a better term, hate young hip-hop heads, and a bulk of the ultra-repetitive new brand of trap. Although, there are always exceptions to the rule. \n\nSome of the younger cats happened to have cool parents (like us) that made them explore the culture. The result is artists like Joey Badass and Bishop Nehru, who authentically sound like the golden era. Other new artists just happen to have that \"it\" factor that made audiences fall in love with hip-hop back in the day; above all, they can spit. Two examples of this are A$AP Rocky (and company) and the main subject of this article, Troy Ave.\n\nI've been listening to Troy for a while now. After his recent release, Major Without A Deal, I felt like I needed to get vocal about him, and why he's a good look.\n\nHe's unapologetically hip-hop, very NYC and 100% independent; and real independence isn't something all artists can claim.\n\nRemember his XXL Freshman cipher? He called out everyone else in the line-up for being a bunch of \"weirdos\". Rightfully so. In a sea of skinny jeans and funny accessories, he was rocking a mink and counting a stack of money while the others dropped their verses. How NYC is that? He's flashy, and no gimmicks at the same time. Is he cocky? Yes. Does he tell you that he's bringing NYC back too much, maybe – but that's hip-hop! It's a cocky, competitive landscape. I've seen plenty of journalists bash hI'm for the above two points, but he's continuing to thrive. Don't forget, hip-hop is an underdog sport.\n\nHe has a bit of a 50 sound, but honestly, he's a heavy hip-hop head from New York City. As if he wasn't at all influenced by 50 – he's the right age. He was 17-18 when Get Rich Or Die Trying Dropped. So many rappers have blended other rappers into their style. This criticism of Troy seems especially dated.

    "content": "Coke Boys, which for the sake of a long-winded explanation is a record label founded by French Montana and incarcerated rapper Max B in 2008, have sure seen some extraordinary ups, and heartbreaking lows over the 7 years. I mean, they are an imprint on both Bad Boy Records and Maybach Music Group – no big deal. They’ve signed chart bullies like Lil Durk, and the late Chinx, who was unfortunately murdered late last month. As well, Max B got knocked for conspiracy to commit murder, and is currently serving 20+ years; although, there’s been some rumours he will walk the streets of NYC next year.\n\nOne thing that consistently speaks volumes is the music that French and his associates put out. In particular, I want to focus on their beat selection. They have a track record of flipping 90’s classics and making smash hits that dominate summers at a time. Here are three that particularly stand out to me.\n\nFrench Montana & Chinx feat Noreaga – Off The Rip produced by Trakformaz\n\nThis one is a flip of the record, by Flip Mode Squad associate Rampage The Last Boyscout, who is also a cousin of the dungeon dragon himself Busta Rhymes. The track originally appeared on Rampage’s gold selling solo LP by. It stands as perhaps his most recognizable (solo) single; however, Rampage is still active. You can follow hI'm on Twitter. The track also “borrows\" lyrically from Capone N Noreaga’s. Noreaga also appears on the song, and in the video.\n\nChinx feat French Montana – I’m a Coke Boy produced by Harry Fraud\n\nThis one is a flip of the classic NYC street record, which featured production from Buckwild, L.E.S., Da Beatminerz. It also featured the dope b-side record.\n\nFrench Montana – Pop That produced by Lee On the Beats\n\nThis track is a flip of Luke’s first record as a solo artist, Wanna Rock aka Doo Doo Brown. Luke has a long dicey and monumental history in the music industry. In fact, he was a catalyst for the censorship wars of rap's infancy. Read up on him, it’s worthy of your time I promise. This song in particular was seen as a pivotal point in Miami Bass, and was released on the heels of the final 2 Live Crew album.\n\nLong live the sample flip! RIP Chinx!",

I'll also confess that I have been completely obsessed with his phenomenon – and believe me, that word was used on purpose. He is a phenomenon.

He also regularly quotes himself and curses NBA players. [sidebar: did you see hI'm on ESPN?]\n\nMuch like 2PAC's often name dropped, yet vaguely defined, movement \"Thug Life\", we have to realize fully what the ultimate purpose of Lil'B's act is.

Whether it's animosity towards one member, who gets more spotlight, à la Method Man, or an awkward love triangle like City High. Money can – and usually does – change everything.\nWhen it comes to golden era groups, it's hard to ignore the imminent rise of Leaders Of The New School. The trio, which consisted of members Charlie Brown, Dinco D and Busta Rhymes came to prominence after their classic appearance on Tribe Called Quests' Scenario. However, behind the scenes – and in one case in front of cameras – the group seemed to begin unraveling almost immediately. The group left behind two notable albums and was the springboard for Busta's rise into the realm of rap's elite.\n\nLast week, I caught up with 1/3 of the group Dinco D. He shared some insight on the group's break-up, what came next for hI'm and his upcoming album with original Tribe Called Quest member Jarobi.\n\nHow did you initially get involved in hip-hop?\n\nGrowing up in NY, it was all around me. Plus, my brother Jazz had a DJ crew – so I would go through all his records and play with his equipment.\n\nHow did you meet Charlie and Busta?\n\nWe grew up in the same neighborhood and went to the same school. Brown introduced me to Busta and wanted to form a group. So we begin writing and performing together. The rest is history.\n\nBusta said in an interview with Vlad that he almost left the group before the first album. What was the dynamic like in the group right before it took off?\n\nHe was doing his own thing for a minute and was neglecting what we were building. He would miss important meetings, and not put effort into us as a “group” – so understandably it was a bit frustrating.\n\nWhat caused the group to split up?\n\nIt was a combination of outside forces and inside forces. You could see people were helping Busta do his own thing, and not supporting Leaders of the New School as a unit. Brown took it hard, cause he formed the group. We worked hard as youngsters to make our dreams a reality, so to have it dismantled quicker than it took us to make it happen was stressful.\n\nTell us about Dinco after LOTNS. What came next for you?\n\nWell, I moved to ATL. I was promoting parties and working with artists down there. It was a whole different vibe at that point in history; Jermaine Dupri was blowing with So So Def, and Laface –with Dallas Austin and Outkast – was on the rise. They had their families and weren't supporting NY artists that much. So, I came back home and started producing again with my brothers Shamello and Buddha (who made Put Your Hands Where Your Eyes Can See for Busta). We did songs for Mc Lyte, Zhané, Pharcyde and couple other artists. We also did scoring for some films.\n\nCan you tell us about the collaborative project you and Jarobi are working on?\n\nIts called the Leaders Quest Mission, a project we have been brewing for the past year or so. We've always been around each other, and recently started doing songs; it was very organic. It's started sounding better and better, so we decided to make it a full LP.\n\nWhat else have you been working on lately?\n\nI have a single called \"MeUwe\" coming out with a band called Shinobi Ninja, and a solo project as well. Plus I have some new artists I'm pushing, one of which is Bigg East from Long Island. Also, I do a regular party called Party Flavors (which is a collaboration with Jarobi), and some product branding. I stay busy.\n\nYou came up in the golden era, what’s your take on the current hip-hop scene?\n\nIt's cool, not as enjoyable as I wish it were, though. There's so much repetitiveness in terms of style/lyrics, and no real versatility. Still, my heart is in hip hop, and it will never leave my body. So I find something I like and support it as much as I can.\n\nWho are some of your fave artists out right now?\n\nA lot of unknown underground artists – and a select few established ones. It goes up and down daily. No one stands out as an innovative phenomenal mega star.\n\nCan you share one of your fave memories of LOTNS? \n\nThe whole movement was incredible; from being on In Living Color, and Arsenio Hall on my birthday, to chilling with LL in LA.\n\nAny last words you’d like to share with our readers?\n\nCheck me out @DINCOD Instagram and Twitter!",

    "content": "I’ll always credit Gang Starr’s Who's Gonna Take The Weight with being the record that made my ears perk up and say \"what ever that is, THAT’S what I wanna do with my life\".\n— El RTNC\n\nNothing beats a little mystery, especially when it comes to launching a new music artist. Hip-hop has had it's share of \"slow reveals\" over the years. Remember the \"Who Is Cam'Ron\" campaign in the Source magazine pre-? Or how about the \"who is Joe Budden\" debate back when his where starting to raise eyebrows. Keeping people guessing until the grand curtain draw can help build sufficient buzz to presell albums and shows, as well as score deals. Keep in mind though, it's (much) harder to maintain that same level of artistic anonymity in the Internet age... Or is it?\n\nThe most recent mystery/conspiracy in hip-hop was the identity of the Coney Island rhyme spitter, Your Old Droog. His vocal tone had damn near everyone, even industry insiders, convinced it was Nas Esco himself releasing music under a new monicker. When the smoke cleared, that was proven to be untrue; however, that takes nothing away from Droog. His flow was so tight, it was held against Illmatic era Nas – pretty impressive shit.\n\nLike most heads, I was immediately taken in by Droog for two reasons: his complex rhyme schemes and his captivating production, courtesy of El RTNC. Much like Droog himself, RTNC has a bit of mystery behind him. He gives little away about himself online, and has gone by many monickers over the years: Rich Boogie, R.Thentic, El RTNC & now El 108 RTNC. With the release of his latest beat tape Sam, which contains many Droog original, I thought I should reach out and learn more about the man behind the beats.\n\nInterview below.\n\nHow did you get into producing?\n\nThe first record that I ever did was L Fudge’s (Rawkus). That's the first record I feel comfortable saying I produced. I knew how it \"should\" sound and even ended up giving back the check I was paid for it to go back into the studio to get it “right”… Now at this time, I was still pretty new to making records. In fact, it was my first year right out of high school. I’d have to really fast forward all the way up to my first works with Homeboy Sandman ( on Stones Throw) until I actually produced another record that I was confident in. Everything in-between was me learning how to make beats in my own way, instead of trying to sound like Premier or Jay Dee. More importantly, I was taking notes and figuring out how to actually produce a record.\n\nWhat was the first beat you ever sold? What was the feeling like?\n\nThat would be L Fudge’s, and then with hI'm again on. I honour Fudge to this day, because without hI'm opening the door to me when he received his (Rawkus) deal, I don’t think I’d have made it in. I was too new to it all. I had no mentor to teach me the machines, or even how to buy records. I didn’t come from a very musical household, so I was really all on my own with my learning process. Plus, when I did meet people, I didn’t really reach out because I’ve always been shy and didn’t want anyone to even get a hint that I might be wack.\n\nStupidity in hindsight.\n\nI was happy to get a check for what I was doing, but in the early days I was more concerned with getting good. My friend 88 keys talked about being around the greats like Q Tip & Large Professor early in his career – and I can’t lie, I feel so envious at times; however, the “thing” I do now is all a product of my experiences getting here.\n\nHow did you originally meet Droog?\n\nA mutual friend of ours called me one day and asked me to listen to a rough he had done to see if I could send hI'm some beats. I did, and droog didn’t really go for them. Instead of accepting rejection, I sent more. 2 full “beat tapes” actually (part of one is on the myrtnc.bandcamp.com store under the name Sam). From there he made the EP. I was at a point where I really didn’t want to do one or two records for people anymore, and I still kind of don’t (with some exception). Rather, I wanted to work on a whole body of work, or better yet, be in a band scenario. The latter came to fruition when and I added our elements to (I was responsible for the drums) & (I chopped up the loop there).\n\nWhen everyone thought he was Nas at first, how hard was it for you to keep his identity secret?\n\nThe Nas thing still gets me, because to this day, I don’t hear Nas in Droog’s voice. It's one thing to have a similar vocal tone, heck, that’s biology. But, for people to think it was Nas meant that an elevated standard was being met. Droog is a great artist. He’s creating lines and concepts while just bugging out. You can tell he’s someone that genuinely loves to create. As far as identity, I for one never did anything to keep his identity a secret. Droog's identity was concealed simply because he didn’t care for being on social media. While many flocked to it, he wasn’t interested. He just wanted to make good songs.\n\nYou have such an original, underground sound. What/who are some of your inspirations?\n\nPersonally, I don’t think I have an underground sound at all. I think it’s more of a classic rock and jazz sound if anything. On top of that, I don’t think underground even exists anymore. The internet has leveled the playing field. Some months ago, when we released the with being the record that made my ears perk up and say \"what ever that is, THAT’S what I wanna do with my life\". Much later on, Slum Village’s “” became my own “Dilla Changed My Life” moment. I could go on and on talking about him, but as I’m a sensitive one, I’ll just say that without his work (that touched me so much in his early career), I may have stopped making beats.\n\nTribe & De La are king, but so is Led Zeppelin, Vince Guaraldi, Stereolab, & The Red Hot Chili Peppers to name a few. Q Tip, Pete Rock & Large Professor are high on theproducer list too.\n\nWhat are you currently working on? Any dope tracks we should be on the lookout for?\n\nAs of late, I’ve started putting out my own beat projects on my bandcamp page (rtnc.bandcamp.com), because I realized that I was sitting on so many pieces of music. It made no sense to keep them hoarded. When I made them, I knew I wanted to share them – and I'm really happy to be able to do so now. I’ve also gotten the chance to be around some really great artists since the Droog project came out, and some records are definitely in the works but out of a \"jinx fear\", I’ll just say to stay tuned. Oh, but you can look out for The Nicest EP by Your Old Droog coming up in a couple weeks.\n\nAny last words for our readers?\n\n“Follow Your Bliss & Don’t Be Afraid” - Joseph Campbell",

    "content": "This was going to be a great week. I had spent a portion of my weekend preparing questions and research for an upcoming interview with Hussein Fatal, 1/3 of the Tupac affiliated Outlawz; unfortunately, it wasn't meant to be. Tragically, he was fatally injured in a car collision in Georgia, leaving behind three daughters and many broken hearts. Our interview may not have worked out before he passed, but I felt I needed to complete this piece to introduce the world to his body of work, and his life.\n\nFatal was born/raised in Montclair, New Jersey, and – like many rappers before and after hI'm – was involved in the drug game. His life took a positive turn after being introduced to Tupac Shakur by Yali Kadafi (a friend/collaborator who was also a member of the Outlawz). After some impromptu auditioning, he was officially inducted into the fold. He went on to feature on some of Pac's most notable joints on his double-disc classic All Eyes On Me. Namely:,, and, of course, the infamous. That album has since has been certified Diamond by the RIAA, which makes it one of the best-selling albums (ever) in the U.S.\n\nTupac, as we all know was tragically gunned down in Vegas at the – in hindsight – unbelievably young age of 26. Fatal wasn't with hI'm that night, as he was home in Jersey for a court date. Shortly after, Ouglaw brethren Yaki (only 19 years old) was also gunned down. Fatal, in the wake of so much loss, quit rap and turned to the street; however, the birth of his first daughter inspired hI'm step back into the game.\n\nHis solo career had a number roadblocks, like a label folding, wack marketing, and incarceration, but he overcame and released 4 solo albums – on top of some collaborative efforts. His journey through the latter part of the 90's and 2000's had layovers on Relativity, Rap-A-Lot and even Murder INC for a short stint. He eventually started his own label, where his catalogue from 2009 onwards currently resides.\n\nHis death is tragic, and with him, we lose another link to the legendary Tupac. Many rap fans, especially younger ones, often tend to name drop Pac in best-of lists, but unless you were experiencing his \"aura\" as it happened, you’ll likely never understand the impact he had on music, and socio-political rhetoric of the time. As well, The Outlawz were a different type of posse. Unlike say Junior Mafia, who were largely ghostwritten by Biggie (and others), they were actual artists. Fatal was a serious artist – with an impressive catalogue. His debut album is a must-listen for sure.\n\nFans continue to mourn, and speculate the mysterious nature of Pac's death. Fatal was often cited amongst the liner notes of the \"conspiracy\", and if Tupac truly is alive in Cuba, are likely gone with Fatal. I had planned to nerd out with Fatal about his time with Pac, his insights on the game and the future of his label, but sadly I’m instead writing this retrospective.\n\nI think it’s only right to share a collection of his music here with you – and invite you to help his family send hI'm off right.\n\nRIP homie",

    "content": "There's no shame in taking your place alongside (non top-5) eccentric super rich rappers like Dre, Puff (and way more that I'm sure would break my heart to learn about). Just don't perpetrate penmanship in the writers circle.\n\nIf you have Twitter and are even remotely interested in hip-hop, then you're up on last week's can of worms, which was opened by Meek Mill. Mostly, he accused hip-hop's poster boy du jour, Drake, of not writing his raps. The thought of it was laughable to fans at first. Then, rapper OG Maco followed up by pointing out that a second writer, one Quentin Miller, was credited with at least five songs on the latest album by the Toronto superstar. We all missed it apparently because it's 2015, so most of us don't own physical copies of anything. Funkmaster Flex stepped it up a by procuring what he claims are the actual reference tracks. In fact, a cease he posted to Instagram seems almost to confirm its authenticity. So the question is, is Quentin Miller Drake's \"ghostwriter\"? Well, as Miller describes, no. Rightfully so. He's a paid, credited collaborator, which in essence still means he \"helped write the songs\".\n\nThe blowback from Drake's camp seems to suggest that it's bigger than just rap. Drake is a multifaceted artist – he composes music (like plays instruments and stuff), he changes the game (constantly) and sets trends. Meek Mill is one dimensional in comparison. You know what, I agree to that effect. Drake is a more powerful brand, and all around better artist than Meek. He's more palatable by the masses, of all ages; although, the question stands. Does Drake write his raps? Not his compositions, not the singing on songs like Hold On We're Going Home, but actual \"hip-hop\" rhymes on songs like Energy. The answer is a gray-area apparently. That's the issue.\n\nIt's not unusual, though, I mean have you ever really looked at the credits of your fave album? They are rarely clean and straight forward. Your heart wants to look at Illmatic and see nothing but N. Jones in the writing credits, likewise for Reasonable Doubt, and more recent efforts by the likes of J. Cole and others. I will acknowledge that rappers writers often credit mad people, such as friends and musicians (for various personal and legal reasons), as in the case of Nas, who credits multiple jazz musicians on Illmatic. But others are a bit more suspect and call the actual solo creative process of your fave artists in question.\n\nI mean, if you have lyrics written for you, and it's widely known/accepted, people get over it and just go for the ride – à la Puffy and Dre. You just won't be acknowledged as a \"writer\", which artists like those above are fine with. The problem is though, is that the hip-hop community is über competitive, and the thought that Drake isn't'shakespearing' his soliloquies is quite off-putting, no matter what average fans feel. The genre of hip-hop has become more of a business than a sub-culture, and there is much more smoke and mirrors that many of you know or can even imagine. It seems inevitable that multi-millionaires who are seemingly detached from the street would enlist hungry up and comers to help them stay fresh.\n\nDoes that make it ok? Well, No.\n\nHip-hop isn't R&B, Rock or any other genre where not writing your shit it is considered \"normal\". I've seen other blogs suggesting that hip-hop was \"born\" when Grandmaster Caz wrote Rapper's Delight, so it shouldn't be so taboo that it still happens today – except that it is. Rapper's delight was a smash hit, but it's a terrible example of artistic mastery in the field of hip-hop. There are plenty of artists who take the time to craft their lyrics – like literally million. Except we don't always champion those artists. The music industry is full of pressures, and often, that means accepting input against your will. Hence, some of your fave artists don't write their shit by themselves. Disappointing huh? Like finding out Santa isn't real right?\n\nI'll broaden this because it's bigger than Drake. It goes for everyone!\n\nThat being said, if you don't write your lyrics, that's fine – but please position yourself accordingly. It's infuriating to actual writers. There's no shame in taking your place alongside (not top-5) eccentric super rich rappers like Dre, Puff (and way more that I'm sure would break my heart to learn about). Just don't perpetrate penmanship in the writer's circle. We don't take kindly to that sort of thing.",

Mostly, he accused hip-hop's poster boy du jour, Drake, of not writing his raps. The thought of it was laughable to fans at first. Then, rapper OG Maco followed up by pointing out that a second writer, one Quentin Miller, was credited with at least five songs on the latest album by the Toronto superstar. We all missed it apparently because it's 2015, so most of us don't own physical copies of anything. Funkmaster Flex stepped it up a by procuring what he claims are the actual reference tracks. In fact, a cease he posted to Instagram seems almost to confirm its authenticity. So the question is, is Quentin Miller Drake's \"ghostwriter\"? Well, as Miller describes, no. Rightfully so. He's a paid, credited collaborator, which in essence still means he \"helped write the songs\".\n\nThe blowback from Drake's camp seems to suggest that it's bigger than just rap. Drake is a multifaceted artist – he composes music (like plays instruments and stuff), he changes the game (constantly) and sets trends. Meek Mill is one dimensional in comparison. You know what, I agree to that effect. Drake is a more powerful brand, and all around better artist than Meek. He's more palatable by the masses, of all ages; although, the question stands. Does Drake write his raps? Not his compositions, not the singing on songs like Hold On We're Going Home, but actual \"hip-hop\" rhymes on songs like Energy. The answer is a gray-area apparently. That's the issue.\n\nIt's not unusual, though, I mean have you ever really looked at the credits of your fave album? They are rarely clean and straight forward. Your heart wants to look at Illmatic and see nothing but N. Jones in the writing credits, likewise for Reasonable Doubt, and more recent efforts by the likes of J. Cole and others. I will acknowledge that rappers writers often credit mad people, such as friends and musicians (for various personal and legal reasons), as in the case of Nas, who credits multiple jazz musicians on Illmatic. But others are a bit more suspect and call the actual solo creative process of your fave artists in question.\n\nI mean, if you have lyrics written for you, and it's widely known/accepted, people get over it and just go for the ride – à la Puffy and Dre. You just won't be acknowledged as a \"writer\", which artists like those above are fine with. The problem is though, is that the hip-hop community is über competitive, and the thought that Drake isn't'shakespearing' his soliloquies is quite off-putting, no matter what average fans feel. The genre of hip-hop has become more of a business than a sub-culture, and there is much more smoke and mirrors that many of you know or can even imagine. It seems inevitable that multi-millionaires who are seemingly detached from the street would enlist hungry up and comers to help them stay fresh.\n\nDoes that make it ok? Well, No.\n\nHip-hop isn't R&B, Rock or any other genre where not writing your shit it is considered \"normal\". I've seen other blogs suggesting that hip-hop was \"born\" when Grandmaster Caz wrote Rapper's Delight, so it shouldn't be so taboo that it still happens today – except that it is. Rapper's delight was a smash hit, but it's a terrible example of artistic mastery in the field of hip-hop. There are plenty of artists who take the time to craft their lyrics – like literally million. Except we don't always champion those artists. The music industry is full of pressures, and often, that means accepting input against your will. Hence, some of your fave artists don't write their shit by themselves. Disappointing huh? Like finding out Santa isn't real right?\n\nI'll broaden this because it's bigger than Drake. It goes for everyone!\n\nThat being said, if you don't write your lyrics, that's fine – but please position yourself accordingly. It's infuriating to actual writers. There's no shame in taking your place alongside (not top-5) eccentric super rich rappers like Dre, Puff (and way more that I'm sure would break my heart to learn about). Just don't perpetrate penmanship in the writer's circle. We don't take kindly to that sort of thing.",

    "content": "I have to admit, as I sat down to write this, I contemplated opening up with a straight out Jersey meme, but thought that may come off a little too cliché. Granted, it would have been fine if I had reviewed this album when it first came across my desk. I admit it, in a sea of releases over the past few months, I completely slept on Everything 050, by the Jersey natives, 050 Boyz – a trio consisting of Prince AK, Tru Trilla and Riq da Kid. I get a lot of promos in my inbox, and for some reason this one just didn't jump out at me. I dropped the ball. Having given this project a few listens, I can definitely co-sign these guys. Here's why:\n\nThey are co-signed by legends\n\nThe group has deep roots and connections in Jersey; however, as a \"group\" of sorts, they first worked together as part of the (shelved) super-group Garden State Greats. The failed group was the brain child of Naughty by Nature frontman Treach. As the 050 Boyz, a group whose ideology is based on the original Garden State Greats concept, they've been guided by DoItAll, one 1/3 of the Lord of the Underground. Now, not sure about you, but Naughty and Lords are definitely in my top 25 groups ever – in fact, The Lord's Keepers of the Funk was one of my fave albums growing up. I know co-signs aren't everything, but having someone who helped shape your love of the culture put their stamp on something should make it an auto-cop.\n\nThey are consistent with their production\n\nI've said it a million times, I'm a sucker for single producer album. This project was produced entirely by Clinton Place who have it's boom-bap charm. This direction keeps the project sounding cohesive, rather than a series of loosies.\n\nThey don't take chances – in a good way\n\nThis album fails to really break any creative ground, but that's not a bad thing.

    "clean_content": "I have to admit, as I sat down to write this, I contemplated opening up with a straight out Jersey meme, but thought that may come off a little too cliché. Granted, it would have been fine if I had reviewed this album when it first came across my desk. I admit it, in a sea of releases over the past few months, I completely slept on Everything 050, by the Jersey natives, 050 Boyz – a trio consisting of Prince AK, Tru Trilla and Riq da Kid. I get a lot of promos in my inbox, and for some reason this one just didn't jump out at me. I dropped the ball. Having given this project a few listens, I can definitely co-sign these guys. Here's why:\n\nThey are co-signed by legends\n\nThe group has deep roots and connections in Jersey; however, as a \"group\" of sorts, they first worked together as part of the (shelved) super-group Garden State Greats. The failed group was the brain child of Naughty by Nature frontman Treach. As the 050 Boyz, a group whose ideology is based on the original Garden State Greats concept, they've been guided by DoItAll, one 1/3 of the Lord of the Underground. Now, not sure about you, but Naughty and Lords are definitely in my top 25 groups ever – in fact, The Lord's Keepers of the Funk was one of my fave albums growing up. I know co-signs aren't everything, but having someone who helped shape your love of the culture put their stamp on something should make it an auto-cop.\n\nThey are consistent with their production\n\nI've said it a million times, I'm a sucker for single producer album. This project was produced entirely by Clinton Place who have it's boom-bap charm. This direction keeps the project sounding cohesive, rather than a series of loosies.\n\nThey don't take chances – in a good way\n\nThis album fails to really break any creative ground, but that's not a bad thing. Rather than try to fit themselves into any contrived roles, they just drop bars with a golden era aesthetic – and obvious street logic and sensibility.\n\nSonically, the group have great chemistry. They almost put me in mind of State Property (only slightly).

I was busy writing about it – naturally. Spencer Waddell though, better known by his \"stage name\" Tooty, was busy uploading his debut mixtape, First Degree Murder. Unfortunately, with a name like that, and the current temperament of the \"Chiraq\" eco-sphere, I wasn't quite sure whether or not I was walking into a project that treaded more into the Chief Keef side of things.

It paints a portrait of a dream chaser, lady killer [figuratively] and a street smart young man who's managed to overcome the negativity engulfing the city of Chicago. The first track I was drawn to was Life Ain't What It Seem, featuring XVRHLDY. If you're an AAHIPHOP reader, you know we're big fans of his – and this song definitely didn't disappoint.

On songs like I Don't Need A Hook, and the super dope Dear Diary, he discusses topics such as loss, drive and determination, while he gets silky on bassy joints like On Repeat and the LL Cool J sampled Super Fly.

Four years after his last release, a Lighter Shade of Darkness, and a brief retirement/hiatus, he’s returning to the scene with an album entitled Off The Grid – and he reached out to AAHIPHOP to spread some of his vibes. I saw the obvious fit, because we’re big fans of Blackalicious over here (peep our Gift of Gab interview), and he very much fits into that pocket. In fact, on his first album.\n\nHis album is a wonderful mix of old school charm, -esque sonic beds and turntablism (orchestrated by Rob Shaker). To top it off, L.S.D has bars –like REALLY dope bars. It’s a great listen. After the first track, I didn’t even notice he had an accent at all, and the fact that he’s from Australia isn’t used as any sort of gimmick or on-running pun. From the jump, with the high-energy title track, Off The Grid, L.S.D sets the tone, and carries the pace throughout with few missteps. He tackles a range of topics from the staple “overcoming in the face of adversity” on the uptempo (very fun) GO, to soaking in the experience and perspective from a conversation with a 75 year-old on the song Story To Tell. Standouts for me were the joints Alive Again, where he discusses universal true-school hip-hop relevancy struggles, the infidelity shaming Cheaters and the uptempo (sexy) sax laced Rio.\n\nThe album's overall strength lies in its intricacy. The micro details (like the cuts) and the general quality – sonically and creatively – are top-notch. It's a very solid effort, and with exception of a few references I just didn't understand, it was quite universal, while remaining true to what I perceive the Perth scene to be. It's full of real-world stories, hardship and most of all, substance. The fact that I'm limited by North American references to give this man context is a testament to my narrow-minded my view of the culture.

I clicked through and discovered a young Brooklyn cat by the name of Blank Face.\n\nThe artwork in question was the cover for a track called Jungle, a 7 minute assault on the the upper echalon of \"power rappers\" who currently run the North American scene. Now, this concept is fully unique, but his bars and voice were. I began diggin through his Soundcloud to see if the joint was a fluke – but it wasn't! He has this grimey New York vibe that I grew up idolizing, with an obvious hunger thatbyiu only get with younger cats. He has serious skills, and I wanted to introduce hI'm to all of you! Peep the Q&A below.\n\nHow did you get into hip-hop?\n\nThe first song I ever heard was Tupac's How Do You Want It. After I heard that song, I was hooked. I started to rewrite his lyrics on old school notebooks. Soon, I started to replace words with my own... And next thing you know, I had sheets and sheets of rhymes and ideas. I started digging into the crates to learn the origins, and become a great listener of everything that had to do with Hip-Hop.\n\nWho are some of your influences?\n\nSome major influences of mine are Tupac, Biggie, Pusha T, Eminem, J.Cole, Kendrick, Wu-Tang – and can't forget 50 Cent! He's One of my favourites.\n\nTell me about Jungle.\n\nJungle was originally suppose to be a 3 minute song. I wrote it frustrated at the current state of hip hop. I hate that it's not about lyrics anymore – it's about a hot beat and hook... There isn't any substance. I was basically letting all my favourite rappers know that I respect them enough to compete against them in any form, to prove I'm a worthy opponent [sic]. The hook was supposed to be me piecing together a bunch of interviews from all the rappers I mentioned throughout the song, but it was still missing something and it sounded to forced and clustered. My Producer, manager and I sat on the record for about a week and a half – and then they came over to my crib to see what we could brainstorm. A third verse became the option but not just any verse... It had to be powerful, and we didn't wanna just extend the beat. We were playing some instrumentals and then it just happened. Mobb Deep's Shook One's came on, and we began to chop it up. I wrote way more then I was suppose to, so we extended the beat twice – and I still had too many bars! We went to the studio a few days later, recorded it, and it came out crazy. We had that song for maybe 4 months and then we finally decided to drop it. 7 minutes of Damage.\n\nWho did that crazy cover?\n\nI do all my own artwork. I have a Degree in Graphic Design – and I'm a Fine Artist as well (with pencil and paper).\n\nWhat are you currently working on?\n\nI'm currently working on a project called H3ZUS LINX. It's basically me using a Jesus chain as a metaphor for being detached from God... It should be a really dope project, not sure on how many tracks but it's def on the way. I should be dropping the first track in about a week or two, once I finish the artwork for it. I'm also working on a 90s RNB Project using samples of old RNB songs that were poppin in the 90s.\n\nDo you perform live?\n\nYeah, I perform live at open mic's.

    "title": "A Conversation With Rock (Of Heltah Skeltah)",
    "content": "[dropcap]W[/dropcap]hen talking about group dynamics, people like to point towards Wu-Tang Clan as the quintessential example of a hip-hop dynasty; however, that's not entirely accurate. It's impossible to have such a conversation and negate the influence of the Boot Camp Click. They were a super-group composed of inner groups: Black Moon, OGC, Smiff-N-Wessun, and one of my fave groups, Heltah Skeltah.\nHeltah Skeltah, a duo composed of Rock and Ruck (Sean Price), came into notoriety when they dropped their classic debut and How did you get hip-hop?\n\nWell, Beatboxing, and Roxanne Roxanne. Honestly, in its earlier days, when it was still a relatively small community, I was younger and wasn't that into it; but, when I heard Roxanne Roxanne, that's when I started writing. I wrote my first rap during that period.\n\nHow did you get into the game?\n\nWell, I got lucky. I had friends that did a lot of the hard work – I just got to have fun. I just had to rap. Steele from Smiff N' Wessun, he was the hardest worker. He used to hang out and do all types of fuckery with us on the street, and also went to school and worked a job to pay for studio time. So really, I got lucky... I came in the game on the strength of my mans and them.\n\n[In hindsight, I wish I'd prodded a little more about his relationship with Tek and Steele. They were instrumental figures in the careers of not just Sean Price and Rock, but also the members of OGC. They all got their first taste of the industry on the back of their classic album \"Dah Shinin”]\n\nHow had you initially met Sean Price?\n\nI don't know; our mothers knew each other. My earliest memory of hI'm was at his 11th birthday party. It was his surprise birthday party, and he already had a job at that point.\n\nAt what stage did you decide to come together as a duo – at what stage did you decide to become Heltah Skeltah?\n\nWe agreed to that over the phone when I got locked up in 1992. But, I had already known for a while that was what I wanted to do. Once I heard son get busy, and I saw his abilities and all that [sic], I knew I wanted hI'm to be my partner. It was just a matter of playing my cards right, feeling out the situation and making it happen.\n\nWhat was the process of recording Nocturnal?\n\nThere were a lot of late nights. A lot of dudes, a lot of cigars, a lot of vegetables, and a lot of jokes. There were some women around – but not too many. There were also a lot of snacks around. Mad cookies and cakes, and a lot of greenery.\n\nYou guys appeared to break up after your second album, Magnum Force. What was the reason? Was there any animosity?\n\nNah, We didn’t break up. I just left Duck Down. We were just on two different pages at that particular point in time. Son was trying to do one thing, and I was attempting to do another; although, Heltah Skeltah was still intact. I was on his [Sean Price] first solo album. For all the time that I wasn’t with Duck Down and cats was saying that we had supposedly broken up… Yeah, I split with Duck Down, but I didn’t split with the Boot Camp. Duck Down just happens to be Dru Ha and Buckshot’s company, so it’s tricky. But it wasn’t that serious on a Heltah Skeltah level.\n\nWhat made you guys get back together to do the D.I.R.T album?\n\nWe felt like it was time. It wasn't that complicated. Everything was rapid-fire, and back to back. Ruck [Sean Price] dropped Monkey Bars; Smiff N Wessun dropped Reloaded, and Buckshot and 9th Wonder dropped Chemistry. Then we were out touring the Last Stand [a 2007 group album by Boot Camp Click]. It was in full swing. So while people were like \"oh shit, Rock is back?\" We were already albums deep. We had bullets in the chamber. We also recorded Casualties of War [another Boot Camp album released the same year] during that period. So at that point, all of the disagreements I'd had with Duck Down had been hashed out, and we were all in. By the time we did D.I.R.T, it was just a matter of asking \"are you guys ready?\"\n\nWhat are you working on now?\n\nI'm working on a bunch of shit. My solo album, for one. I've been working on it for a while now, but you know... Situations change, the sounds change, my ears change, and the message I may be trying to give the people may change. The album is in the process. Life happens though, and right now. I just lost the Yin to my Yang... My brother just died. So, there are changes that need to happen on my album now.\n\nWhat are some of your fondest memories of Sean Price?\n\nJust knowing him, just having the privilege to be chosen to be that nigga's partner [sic] – that's bigger than anything else. He was a one of a kind, unique soul. You don't just find an energy like his anywhere. As unique as we all are as human beings, I mean, you may find somebody else at some point that reminds you of me, but you won't find anyone that reminds you of him. He was one of one – and he chose me. I mean, I tricked hI'm into accepting me, but he chose me!\n\nWhat would you want the world to know about Sean Price?\n\nEverything I just said. When I say he was special, I mean that. I want them to listen to his catalog – and his jokes, his vulgarities and all his slap the shit out you isms, and enjoy all of it. He epitomized the term not giving a fuck – and being yourself in the truest form. Always telling the truth is a part of being yourself, but with him, it was a bit more complicated. If he felt like lying to you, he would. He didn't give a fuck about your rules. He would say what I was thinking. Shit that you were scared to say, he'd say – no problem.\n\nOn top of all that, he was a great father and a wonderful husband. He was proud to be married. He wasn't one of these cats out here who's married acting like they aren't married – running around in videos and misleading the public. I mean, I get the look, but I also understand the subliminal messages we send to people through our music – and videos. We're all programmed by what we see. I mean, there's a nigga named Rambo in every hood [sic]... Where did we get that from? That's the kind of stuff that came from our programming, things that were always pushed into our faces. Our whole lives. A vast majority of the punchlines that most rappers have were influenced by movies and TV.\n\nWe're shaped by what we see.\n\nThe right wingers always want to come down on rappers for the messages we share, and the impact we have on the youth. I said it on wax: \"We influence the kids – but who influences the rappers?\" Biggie Smalls called himself Frank White. Where'd he get that from? They don't want to talk about that.\n\nWhen Biggie Small died, how old was he?\n\n26, I believe. I remember being young and thinking he was a grown man... But in hindsight, he was young!\n\nThat's exactly where I was going with this... I mean when you look back on it what, 15 years later, and you realize he was just 25–26... He was a fucking kid! All the hardest rappers out there were just kids. We were all young minds, still susceptible to peer pressure, and influence. If you're in the NBA, those dudes protect your ass. Even if you're in your 30's, you still a system around designed to keep you straight. But not for us. We had to learn on our own. I have been around the world, and I learned: fuck all this imagery. That dude Sean Price took his wife everywhere – if he could take her, he took her. He rapped about her on half of his songs, and he's got like 1000 songs. That type of thing speaks volumes. Very few of us out here are being our authentic selves.\n\nAnd as well, the outpour of love and support he received worldwide speaks volumes to the impact he had on people's lives.\n\nWord. He was a magnetic dude. A fucking comedian. He's legitimately one of the funniest people you'd ever meet – and he'd smack the shit out you. I just love that combination.\n\nThat's an excellent combination.\n\nThat's what I want the world to know about him... But really, the world probably already knows that. All they got to do is listen to one of his records. You'll probably hear hI'm mention his wife; you'll probably hear hI'm shout out his daughter; actually, you for sure will. He always mentions himself, and he named his daughter Shaun Price – so he legitimately says her name in every song. So her name will be immortalized. He did that for her, or maybe for him, but that's that, he mentions her name in every song. You'll hear everything I just said.\n\nSo in a sense, I could've just said, \"play one of his records.\" Because it's all hI'm – through and through. Even when he's saying some weird shit that you know couldn't have happened in real life, it's still him.",
    "clean_content": "[dropcap]W[/dropcap]hen talking about group dynamics, people like to point towards Wu-Tang Clan as the quintessential example of a hip-hop dynasty; however, that's not entirely accurate. It's impossible to have such a conversation and negate the influence of the Boot Camp Click. They were a super-group composed of inner groups: Black Moon, OGC, Smiff-N-Wessun, and one of my fave groups, Heltah Skeltah.\nHeltah Skeltah, a duo composed of Rock and Ruck (Sean Price), came into notoriety when they dropped their classic debut and How did you get hip-hop?\n\nWell, Beatboxing, and Roxanne Roxanne. Honestly, in its earlier days, when it was still a relatively small community, I was younger and wasn't that into it; but, when I heard Roxanne Roxanne, that's when I started writing. I wrote my first rap during that period.\n\nHow did you get into the game?\n\nWell, I got lucky. I had friends that did a lot of the hard work – I just got to have fun. I just had to rap. Steele from Smiff N' Wessun, he was the hardest worker. He used to hang out and do all types of fuckery with us on the street, and also went to school and worked a job to pay for studio time. So really, I got lucky... I came in the game on the strength of my mans and them.\n\n[In hindsight, I wish I'd prodded a little more about his relationship with Tek and Steele. They were instrumental figures in the careers of not just Sean Price and Rock, but also the members of OGC. They all got their first taste of the industry on the back of their classic album \"Dah Shinin”]\n\nHow had you initially met Sean Price?\n\nI don't know; our mothers knew each other. My earliest memory of hI'm was at his 11th birthday party. It was his surprise birthday party, and he already had a job at that point.\n\nAt what stage did you decide to come together as a duo – at what stage did you decide to become Heltah Skeltah?\n\nWe agreed to that over the phone when I got locked up in 1992. But, I had already known for a while that was what I wanted to do. Once I heard son get busy, and I saw his abilities and all that [sic], I knew I wanted hI'm to be my partner. It was just a matter of playing my cards right, feeling out the situation and making it happen.\n\nWhat was the process of recording Nocturnal?\n\nThere were a lot of late nights. A lot of dudes, a lot of cigars, a lot of vegetables, and a lot of jokes. There were some women around – but not too many. There were also a lot of snacks around. Mad cookies and cakes, and a lot of greenery.\n\nYou guys appeared to break up after your second album, Magnum Force. What was the reason? Was there any animosity?\n\nNah, We didn’t break up. I just left Duck Down. We were just on two different pages at that particular point in time. Son was trying to do one thing, and I was attempting to do another; although, Heltah Skeltah was still intact. I was on his [Sean Price] first solo album.

Artists like the almighty J.Cole, and backpack-rap demi-gods Little Brother have roots in the \"city of oaks\". I'd like to introduce you all to a new voice hailing the city – Descendent. I featured this brother a while back in the #UnsignedHype section but wanted to delve a little deeper into his work. \n\nHis debut album, Road to Greatness: Journey of a Lost Soul, is an excellent body of work. It's an an eclectic mix of bassy trap sounds on songs like Road To the Future and Break The Cycle, 90's boom bap on songs like Too Easy and Trouble, and soulful hip-hop beats on songs like I'm Ready and Soul – which almost brings to mind the early work of hometown hero 9th Wonder. The mixture of sounds is very organic, which makes it hard to pinpoint if he's \"stronger\" when concentrating on one particular sound. Nothing sounds forced – and although he switches up the sonic-sub genre, he never wavers from his message or personal style/flow. He’s honest, insightful, and very real. He focuses on positive messages, stories of struggle, determination and moral-filled lyrics that paint a very clear picture of who he is as a person – and an artist. \n\nHis dedication to his craft – and values – is best summed in the two skits on the project. In the second last one, which is a preamble to the album closer Soul, he’s told he should “live the life” and make a more commercially viable brand of hip-hop. He responds only with, “ I don’t want to be another lost soul.” This sentiment is expressed throughout Road to Greatness: Journey of a Lost Soul. For a debut project, it's exceptionally polished and self-aware. Descendent is one to keep an eye on.",

    "content": "\"Fight for your rights, stand up and be heard... You’re just as good as any man, believe that, word.\"\n\n– Salt-N-Pepa (from the song None Of Your Business)\n\nHip-hop music has had an abundance of fundamental shifts in sound, tone and subject matter over the past 40 years. Most have been so severe that they ultimately spelled professional doom for many artists who tried to keep up with the times by simply rolling over and – metaphorically – letting the styles engulf their being. Some of the most notable shifts were the rise of NewJack Swing, the rise of Gangsta Rap, the shift to Jiggy, and the most recent rise of drill and trap music. Golden era artists had it the absolute worst. While many were able to spot the sell-out nature of the almost gimmicky nature of many hip-hop sub-genres, and maintain a timeless backpack/underground aesthetic we still knock today, some of your fave rappers either went out trying to fit into the gangsta mold, or as new jack swinging casanovas in a fly zoot suits. To see any artist from the 80’s still making any sort of noise today, really speaks to their ability to make relevant music across all the sub-genres, and stay true to – and to see any female artists (in hip-hop) still maintaining relevance is, well, that much more remarkable. I’d like to take some time to focus on one female group in particular: Salt-N-Pepa.\n\nAt a time in history when hip-hop was largely considered a fad that major record companies were reluctant to prescribe to, Salt-N-Pepa took over the scene with the infectious hit Push It. Their debut album went platinum, which made them the first all-female group to reach platinum status. In fact, they were the first all-female group ever. They released a total of 5 albums throughout the course of their (recording) career, with none selling less than gold. Their fourth album, Very Necessary, was their highest selling effort, selling over 5 million records. How could it not? It had massive hits like Shoop, Whatta Man featuring En Vogue, and None of Your Business.\n\nAfter their final release Brand New, which suffered from failed promotion due to label folding, the ladies called it quits. Life went on; life after limelight took effect and there were (independent from each other) marriages, children, radio hosting, television shows, and, well, real life.\n\nWhat goes around comes around. The sharp resurgence in hip-hop nostalgia, which has seen groups like Naughty By Nature steady touring over the past few years, Salt-N-Pepa just couldn’t stay away from the stage. With a legion of fans worldwide hungry to relive their younger years, and new fans who caught the bug by hearing one of their timeless hits, they're still a heavy draw. Rightfully so, they wrote the blueprint for all-female hip-hop groups, and artists in general. They had bars, they could dance, they were liberated, empowered and sexual (without being at all sleazy or over the top), and above all, they made great music. They flourished in a time before the internet, so rather than be reduced to a series of singles, they have an untouchable catalogue of gems that goes deeper than Shoop, Push It and Let’s Talk About Sex.\n\nWe’ve taken the liberty of pulling together a Coles notes mix of some of our fave joints. R U Ready? Salute to the real Queens of hip-hop.",

I mean, Big Boi, was once partnered with Andre 3000 to form what had (eventually) become the most matched, mid-matched duo in hip-hop history. In fact, their final album, Speaker Boxxx/Love Below, was split into two completely separate albums – and the contrast between the two was staggering. What I'm getting at is that clearly the man isn't afraid to take chances, musically. Well, a pop-up ad, led Big Boi to Shazam the duo of Sarah Barthel and Josh Carter – and here we are! After months of teasing, and some epic performances, they officially dropped their self-titled EP.\n\nBig Grams is an absolute joy to listen to. What I appreciate the most, and I'm sure many listeners would agree, is that it delivers exactly what you think it will. They all live up to their individual strengths and deliver songs that are fun and incredibly dope. When an artist is truly enjoying the process and is genuinely inspired, it carries through to the music. Lights On and Fell Into The Sun have been knocking out of my speakers for the past few hours on repeat. Also, if you've ever dreamed what Big Boi may sound like over Premo-esque east coast production, you'll want to pump Put It On Her with the windows down in the ride. The only misstep for me was that Skrillex joint...meh.\n\nIt's a great listen, and the perfect way to kick-off the autumn music rush. If you can tear yourself away from Drake and Future, definitely drop this into your music device and let it run around a few times.",

    "content": "\"They talking about a million, I'm talking about Infinity...\"\n\n—Baliva\n\nI've said it before, but I'll echo that I have a lot to learn about the UK music scene. I have to say, though, I'm always impressed with the level of talent I hear. My latest find from across the pond is Baliva, a talented MC that wears his heart – and his faith in his sleeve. Born in Harare, Zimbabwe, he moved to London in 2001 to study media production and throw himself entirely into his pursuit of his lifelong dream of becoming a successful hip-hop artist. On his journey, though, he faced personal struggles that eventually – at his lowest – saw the young artist become Christian, and focus on using his talent for good. His latest effort, Imperfect, is both culmination of this vision and a wonderful body of music.\n\n\"Now people wanna act strange when you start to make a change but keep pressing on because my Lord will make you strong.\"\n\n— Baliva\n\nSonically the album has a blend of club/trap, backpack/street-hop, and Dilla-esque soundscapes over which Baliva delivers messages of self-worth, perseverance, and faith while giving a look into his innermost emotions. It's telling, honest and quite refreshing. Over songs like Nothing To Prove, Addicted To Approval and Million Dollar Vanity, he tackles issues that range from social and racial injustice to the overall over-emphasis and reliance that many of us have on not only social media but'things' in general. He's most telling though on songs like the touching Broken Home, where he discusses how painful it is not to be involved in his child's life.\n\n\"My purpose is to empower people to live lives filled with hope, courage and freedom\"\n\n— Baliva\n\nImperfect is an audio manifesto, in which Baliva is showing the world who he was, and who he's become. He says best on the album's outro, I'm Free: \"this project marks a new chapter in my life.\" He's free from the constant people pleasing, and acceptance seeking that – frankly – plagues a lot of us. He's not forcing you to subscribe to what he's saying, rather describing a path towards a respective light he's found in his life. Whether you follow hI'm or not, he's saved\n\nGives this brother a listen.",

He's most telling though on songs like the touching Broken Home, where he discusses how painful it is not to be involved in his child's life.\n\n\"My purpose is to empower people to live lives filled with hope, courage and freedom\"\n\n— Baliva\n\nImperfect is an audio manifesto, in which Baliva is showing the world who he was, and who he's become. He says best on the album's outro, I'm Free: \"this project marks a new chapter in my life.\" He's free from the constant people pleasing, and acceptance seeking that – frankly – plagues a lot of us. He's not forcing you to subscribe to what he's saying, rather describing a path towards a respective light he's found in his life. Whether you follow hI'm or not, he's saved\n\nGives this brother a listen.",
    "excerpt": "\"They talking about a million, I'm talking about Infinity...\"\n\n—Baliva\n\nI've said it before, but I'll echo that I have a lot to learn about the UK music scene.",

    "title": "Still Funky Enough: Interview With D.O.C",
    "content": "\"...at the end of the day, we made some great f--king work.\"\n\n— The D.O.C\n\nThe Meek Mill and Drake \"beef\" – and I use the term loosely – exposed something it never intended to; it would appear that in 2015, people still don't read album credits. I've already spoken of the phenomenon of'ghostwriting', but what about the phenomenon of just'writing'? A very quick glance reveals that Drake's shadowy punchline pusher (or helper) is very much credited, so why isn't he more widely acknowledged for his contributions to Drizzy's platinum effort?\n\nThis is the same question I have when I think about platinum selling west coast (via Dallas, Texas) artist The D.O.C. He was an integral writing resource for the group NWA as they recorded their legendary Straight Outta Compton album. However, shortly after seeing the success of his own (eventually) platinum selling debut album No One Can Do It Better, he was involved in a near-fatal car accident, which left hI'm with crushed vocal cords, effectively ending his career as a'rapper.'\n\nThis didn't stop him, however, from becoming the pen behind NWA. With Ice Cube's departure, he stepped up and became a driving force behind their second and final, NIGGAZ4LIFE. He also wrote large portions of Eazy-E's material, and Dr. Dre's game-changing Chronic LP.\n\nOver the years, there were some ups, downs, fall outs and legal woes. Although, as news reports, and D.O.C himself confirm, he has regained the use of his vocal cords and is eyeing a return to the rap world. I was lucky enough to talk with the west coast institution about the NWA doc, the return of his voice and his place in rap history.\n\nInterview below.\n\nWhat did you think about Straight Outta Compton?\n\nWell, I thought it was a great movie, and I support it one million percent. I went and saw the movie myself maybe two, three nights ago and enjoyed it.\n\nNow, one thing I noticed about the movie is they touched your accident, your involvement with NWA is downplayed.\n\nI don’t like to dwell on negative things. The first part you said was \"I was there\" and that… That’s all that matters to me, you know. That’s their vision; they decided to write that movie that way, and it was a great film. No, it was not a hundred percent accurate, but that’s what movie is? I support their vision, like I said, one million percent and when I get into my film, my version of those events, I hope they support me as much as I support them.\n\nYou’re a very prolific writer. A lot of people think about a ghost writer as someone that writes stuff behind the scenes – and isn’t credited. But, it’s interesting because you’re a ghostwriter in a sense that, not everybody knows that you wrote so much stuff for NWA. You’re entirely credited. \n\nWell, Not actually fully credited but most of it I am. I’m not credited for any of the stuff on Eazy’s first album or NWA’s first album. My name never showed up, but everybody knows I did it.\n\nIf you look up Straight Outta Compton on Wikipedia, you’re listed as a writer.\n\nYeah.\n\nThey’re just not paying you for it.\n\nYeah, something like that. (Laughs) Something like that.\n\nYou’re kind of the main voice behind the group – and even the driving force behind Dr. Dre’s The Chronic.\n\nWhat you’re saying is right, and you’re right. You’re totally on point. From my perspective, there is another story that’s interesting, compelling and yet to be told. So I think the time for it to start getting its light is upon us because so many people after that movie are interested. So many people are saying that like… \"who is this guy who's in the whole movie? We never see hI'm do shit...what is his story?\" I’m working on a documentary right now. See, a lot of the stuff that you saw in that movie was the shiny part, you know what I mean, and the darker part you didn’t get to see. So, me exposing what I would refer to as the'darker periods' of that successful era would make a very compelling movie or documentary.\n\nThe movie made it seem as though Ice Cube did most of the writing you know; they put a lot of emphasis on it. You were, in reality, a pretty important piece of that puzzle.\n\nWell, I don’t want to toot my own horn, but toot-toot godammit. But, the thing that’s most important to me is being there and being part of that amazing time. Then, that incredible music. It means a lot to me that in the sense that we were young guys that were trying to face something that was bigger than us. That wasn’t a hundred percent our goal in life, you know what I mean, we were just young, we wanted to make this record and have fun. Public enemy pushed us in a direction that allowed us to express what we were doing in a way that can be channeled into something positive, so that felt excellent to me, and it still feels good. Although, like Cube said, they \"have the authority to kill a minority.\" They’re doing it – and they’re doing it at an alarming rate and it’s screwed up. What hurt bothers me is no one connected to the success is saying anything about it. It was supposed to be a staple of what this movie is about. The crucial part of what makes this an outstanding film was that it shone that light on America. It showed that thirty years later she's still a little bit of a fuck up, because she’s allowing this shit to go on.\n\nAbsolutely – and again I get it, it’s a Hollywood movie. I understand why marketers wouldn’t want to do that, but it seems like missed opportunity\n\nYeah.\n\nStraight Outta Compton, I think, was number 6 on the Billboard last week...\n\nWow!\n\nAnd Eazy Duz It was number 42, you know what I mean? Anyone or anything that was mentioned in this movie is selling.\n\nNow I don’t want to take anything away from anybody – I think the success of this whole movement is magnificent and wonderful. I just don’t want it to come and go without giving something back to the energy that got us here; you know what I mean? Like, we learned a lot of lessons and even myself I went through a lot of shit during that time, it was a dark period of my life. I sacrificed a lot to those great records, and so I had to go through an alcoholic period and a period where I started using drugs. I made it through all of that, though, and I’m more focused and serious now than I was then – just with a different mind state. So, if I do get the chance to tell my story, I want to benefit more than just people who love gangsta rap, but everybody who is struggling too. Even people that are thinking about suicide, or just dealing with the fact that life is not fair. All those things will pass if you believe in yourself and push forward. Maybe thirty years later, they will make a movie about you. (laughs)\n\nIt’s crazy, and I mean, it must be gratifying to know that a lot of the stuff that you were making back then is still a hundred percent relevant now. It’s being consumed by another generation.\n\nYeah, it’s pretty cool to be on Twitter and have some sixteen-year-old kid tell me that his father has made hI'm listen to my first record and he loves me, it’s cool.\n\nIt doesn’t feel dated. It doesn’t feel old you know what I mean? It all holds up.\n\nIt’s called timeless.\n\nAbsolutely.\n\nThe key to making great music is to make it timeless. The stuff we did back then, it had no time to it, it was just had that feel to it, and that’s how I like to make music man. I just want to make great shit, and I wouldn't care if it was visual art, or music, or poetry. I’m just into making great art.\n\nSo you’re going to be making more new art in the future?\n\nI am. One of the deals is that the accident that happened to me in that movie took my voice. It was taken from me, and for a quarter century my vocal cords didn’t work. I got arrested about two years ago, and I spent a year locked up. While I was locked up, by some blessing, those vocal cords were starting to move again on their own – and from there I could manipulate my vocal cords to make a solid tone again. So, I have a voice again. It’s not anywhere near strong, and it isn’t comfortable. It feels like putting your shoes on the wrong foot and walking because I haven’t used those muscles in fucking twenty-five years.\n\nBut I have been working on it, and I’m trying to build them, slowly and surely. I’m going to make new art. I believe that God gave me that blessing as a sign to tell me that it’s time to start talking. It has nothing to do with rapping or being the greatest rapper again, I’ve already done that. It has nothing to do with making these magnificent platinum records; I've already done that. I think it was given back to me because it’s time for someone to start talking.\n\nAbsolutely and the time is now.\n\nWe’re in an appalling place bro. We in the United States we are in a bad fucking place. It’s not going to get any better unless people – and I don’t mean black people, and I don’t mean white people, I mean everybody.\n\nEverybody!\n\nI mean if you don’t get your shit together and get your head out of your ass, and realize that there are forces that are working in this world that are trying to manipulate the future. They're making it so black folks and white folks will never really have the chance to get along – and white folks and Mexican folks or any of these folks will never have an opportunity at peace. Peace means that the power would be in the hands of the people. All power should be in that hands of the people; but, as long as the power is in the hands of the elite few then it will always be fucked up because they make the money. All of these Republicans are negative; they don’t know how to talk to people or about people, so I don’t want someone like that speaking for me.\n\nIt’s just a hamster wheel – If it’s not Trump, it’s another Trump.\n\nThere you go bro; now you get it. Yeah, I vote for Kanye. (Laughs)\n\nIt’s all about new ideas bro, new ideas. (Laughs)\n\nI don't want this to turn into a United Nations debate (laughs). Look, I’m proud of Cube, Dre and Yella and Ren and Eazy (R.I.P) for doing what they did. A lot of it was fucked up, and there was a lot of stealing, back stabbing, and goofy nigga shit. And, Jerry is not the fucking saint he pretends to be – but, it’s the music business man! It’s the business that we chose, and sometimes it gets fucked up, but at the end of the day, we made some great fucking work.\n\nTimeless records that will never go away. Timeless records that almost thirty years after the fact are topping Billboard record charts.\n\nYeah man, that’s fucking cool and shit. I’ll just wait now to get the fucking money. (Clears throat)\n\nAre you properly credited on the Niggas4life?\n\nYeah, I get everything after Straight Outta Compton. Now, I didn’t make any money on this movie, nobody asked me for anything, nobody offered me anything – and so I didn’t feel it necessary to chase these guys for anything. I’m happy for their success. I’m a spiritual person, and I believe that what was supposed to be mine will make its way to me if I continue to work hard for it.",

    "content": "Let's face it, the term DJ is very subjective – and that's probably the Internet's fault. But let's be clear when you're in the presence of a true turntablist, the difference becomes crystal clear. Kind of like drinking freshly squeezed orange juice. Real Mixtapes, by real DJs, were – back in the day – audio adventures that took the listener on a journey. Every nuance, including the track list, was laboured over, and the products stood the test of time. Kind of like classics by DJs like How did you get into DJ'ing?\n\nI always wanted to be a DJ. Ever since I was a little kid. I think from the moment I first heard hip-hop and reggae in the early nineties I was hooked! I never looked into though until years later. I was busy running a tutoring company (hence how I got my DJ name), and one of my students' parents owned a DJ equipment distribution company. They were nice and hooked me up with some equipment, so I started practicing.\n\nWho were some of your influences?\n\nIt's hard to be from Montreal trying to become a DJ and not be influenced by whatever A-Trak is doing. He's such a force in the DJ/music community. I always loved scratching, one of my first mentors was MTL DMC champ DJ mana – he was/is beyond technically skilled. I like to listen to everyone to get a feel for what they're doing, the direction they're going in, etc.\n\nWhat was your reaction to the attention you started getting on You-Tube?\n\nThe You-Tube success wasn't overnight, It was more of a steady grind; but, of course, it's great that so many people listen now. I think one of the most important goals of music (and why I got into DJ'ing) is to share it with as many people as possible. I get tons of people messaging me saying how they enjoy the music – and sometimes I get amazing, personal, inspirational thank you messages. Those are always the most gratifying. It's also given me a platform to connect with amazing people from around the world that I would never connect with otherwise, and I get to meet them when I travel, so it's great.\n\nOf all your mixes, do you have a favourite mix?\n\nI don't think I have a favourite mix. I listen to a bunch of my mixes, is that narcissistic? I listen to the D'Angelo mix a lot, though, he's my favourite artist, so I'm probably biased.\n\nWho are your fave artists out right now?\n\nMy current favorite artist is the Weeknd; I love the new take on r&b. J Cole raps a mean bar too – he's got a nice old school flow, but it sounds fresh.

But let's be clear when you're in the presence of a true turntablist, the difference becomes crystal clear. Kind of like drinking freshly squeezed orange juice. Real Mixtapes, by real DJs, were – back in the day – audio adventures that took the listener on a journey. Every nuance, including the track list, was laboured over, and the products stood the test of time. Kind of like classics by DJs like How did you get into DJ'ing?\n\nI always wanted to be a DJ. Ever since I was a little kid. I think from the moment I first heard hip-hop and reggae in the early nineties I was hooked! I never looked into though until years later. I was busy running a tutoring company (hence how I got my DJ name), and one of my students' parents owned a DJ equipment distribution company. They were nice and hooked me up with some equipment, so I started practicing.\n\nWho were some of your influences?\n\nIt's hard to be from Montreal trying to become a DJ and not be influenced by whatever A-Trak is doing. He's such a force in the DJ/music community. I always loved scratching, one of my first mentors was MTL DMC champ DJ mana – he was/is beyond technically skilled. I like to listen to everyone to get a feel for what they're doing, the direction they're going in, etc.\n\nWhat was your reaction to the attention you started getting on You-Tube?\n\nThe You-Tube success wasn't overnight, It was more of a steady grind; but, of course, it's great that so many people listen now. I think one of the most important goals of music (and why I got into DJ'ing) is to share it with as many people as possible. I get tons of people messaging me saying how they enjoy the music – and sometimes I get amazing, personal, inspirational thank you messages. Those are always the most gratifying. It's also given me a platform to connect with amazing people from around the world that I would never connect with otherwise, and I get to meet them when I travel, so it's great.\n\nOf all your mixes, do you have a favourite mix?\n\nI don't think I have a favourite mix. I listen to a bunch of my mixes, is that narcissistic? I listen to the D'Angelo mix a lot, though, he's my favourite artist, so I'm probably biased.\n\nWho are your fave artists out right now?\n\nMy current favorite artist is the Weeknd; I love the new take on r&b. J Cole raps a mean bar too – he's got a nice old school flow, but it sounds fresh.

    "content": "\"I'm not fist pumping; I'm raising my fist.\" \n\n– Siimba Liives Long\n\nThe \"it\" factor is undeniable, unavoidable and can't be fabricated. No matter how much money you dump into an artist, if they aren't unique enough to truly stand out, then they'll have a rough time building a loyal fanbase. A relative newcomer on the scene, Siimba Liives Long, is one such with an undeniable \"it\" factor. An Ethiopian-American artist who was born in NY resided in Brooklyn and grew up in Addis (Ethiopia's capital) is about to take off – and for so many reasons. Here's three.\n\nFirst off, he's talented as hell. He has bars, and judging what I've heard from hI'm this far, he seems to be along the vein of golden era inspired reality rap that artists like Joey Bada$$ inhabit; however, he has a unique sound. Second, he has a dope sense of style. Draped in traditional garb, and with a demeanour that almost puts me in the mind of late 90's Afu-Ra, he stands out.\n\nLastly, his first single/video Cocaine Bimbie off his upcoming sonic-series Zemenay's Gemiinii is flames. Even the fact that he calls it a sonic series is cool!\n\nThe video itself deserves all the attention I already know it's going to get. It premiered yesterday on Noisy and is a must-watch. I mean homie is walking around with lions and eating fire – it's hypnotizing. This isn't a \"rent lions and ball out in a Lear jet\" kind of video either. He's in straight up Africa, with lions! He shot the video in Ethiopia, South Africa and Brooklyn because they all play(ed) such a big role in his life and his journey. Also, again, keep in mind that he's an unsigned artist – so no fancy label budgets here. He still managed to make one of the dopest visuals we've seen all year. Just saying, though.\n\nSiimba Liives Long is an artist to keep on your radar. Just remember where you heard it first.",

    "content": "Fat Beats, aside from being the go-to new york record spot for legendary DJ's in NYC during hip-hop's golden age, was also a congregation circle for underground emcees on the come up. In it's last few years, though, the employees of the vinyl haven proved to be amongst its best-kept secret., J57,, Koncept,, & DJ Goo formed the, a collective that has amassed an impressive resume, both collectively and individually. As of recent, two of the members, producer J57 and Queens-bred spitter Koncept have formed a metaphorical Voltron, and doing some serious damage with their new music.\n\nKoncept made a name for himself in the underground hip-hop trenches, but these days he's working with hip-hop goliaths such as Ty Dolla $ign, Pharoahe Monche, Royce da 5’9” and more. With J57 on the beats, he's preparing to drop The Fuel EP on November 20th, led off with the ultra-dope single Porcelain. I had the opportunity to chat with Kon about the project, his background in the game, his new label, and his skills on the one's and two's. Peep the Q&A below.\n\nHow did you get into hip-hop originally?\n\nI grew up in Queens New York. My next-door neighbor was a graffiti artist, and when my parents used to go out, they’d have hI'm watch me. He got me into drawing and writing graffiti, and he gave me the name Koncept when I was 7. What my parents didn’t know back then is that they would go out, and he would take me out writing with hI'm sometimes. So my first time I ever went out writing I was like seven years old. At age 11 I got my first turntables, which I still have – and still use. You know, I always liked writing. I wrote short stories and poetry. I used to freestyle for fun. I'd have a microphone that I plugged into my mixer, and I'd freestyle for fun when I was hanging out with friends and stuff like that; but, then when I started to write raps it was like I instantly fell in love. I got hooked and stopped doing everything else.\n\nI read before that you DJ. You don’t call yourself a DJ, but you have tables, you’ve had them for a long time, and you’re probably pretty good. \n\n[laughs] I used to watch DMC tapes, all the Scratch DVD’s and the Beat Junkies DVD; I loved scratching, like Q-Bert and all that. It’s funny, I was in my parent’s house about a week ago, and I was looking through some old stuff and I found some old CDs and cassette tapes. I was listening to some things that I did – and I was like, “This shit is dope!” [Laughing]. I was like, “Maybe I should start scratching on my stuff some more.”\n\nI mean, look at Lord Finesse, he almost exclusively DJ's and produces now.\n\nYeah, yeah, yeah.\n\nDo you see yourself doing something like that in the future?\n\nNo, I don’t think that I’ll ever do that. I have been thinking about doing some things — like maybe at shows in the middle of a set I’ll just sort of stop and then go behind the turntables and start scratching and cutting up records. Just do it as a surprise, you know what I mean? Because again, a lot of people don’t know about it so I think that would be something cool to add to the shows.\n\nYou could start the set like that. Be the warm-up DJ, and then you just come out, no one would expect it at all.\n\nYeah, exactly.\n\nSo maybe talk a little bit about Brownbag All-Stars. How did you get involved in the group?\n\nI think it was 2007. As a DJ, I’ve always bought records at Fat Beats, since the time that I got my turntables. One day I went in there to get some records. I walked in and J-57, who used to go by J-Logic, was playing beats in the store, and there were people rapping over them.\nI jumped into the cipher and started rapping. That’s how I and J met. We started talking; we exchanged phone numbers, and he sent me some beats. We became friends, and he got me the job at Fat Beats. Working at Fat Beats, there was a bunch of other employees, and it turns out that we formed our group called Brownbag All-Stars.\n\nThat’s crazy. Tell me about the new EP and the process of putting it together.\n\nI dropped my solo album titled, “Awaken” in 2012, alongside a handful of music videos. One day, I got an email from Red Bull. They said that they found my music and wanted to bring me on as a Red Bull artist. I thought I was pretty crazy because, at that time, Red Bull was mainly in the extreme sports world. I was like, “Wow, Red Bull! That’s insane.” So I agreed, and a couple days later I got a big box of Red Bull [laughs]. \n\nThey (Red Bull) hit me up and asked me if I wanted to be in this contest where they took all the people that they had as artists, and people would vote for their favorite artist – and the winner of this contest would get studio time down in LA. I ended up winning the competition. That was at the same time that J-57 and I were already talking about working on the next album where he was going to produce it all, and it was going to be all sample-free. So when we got this opportunity, we decided to be a group like a Gang Starr. You know, like Primo and Guru or like Blu and Exile. We just wanted a project where he produces the whole thing, and I do all the vocals on it. So they flew us down to LA, and we worked on the album. The album is called, “Flight” that is going to come out in 2016. We did the album, and our aI'm was just to make the best music of our lives. We finished the album, and the following week we were already sitting down with major labels.\n\nIt was just a big turning point for us because we knew that we had made the best music that we’ve ever made, but we didn’t know, I guess, the extent of where it could go. So we took those meetings and all that, and then we flew back to New York, and that’s when we decided to record an EP to be the precursor to the album. So we recorded \"The Fuel. In that period, we had some offers from major labels and decided not to go that route and do it on our own. So that’s what we’ve been building. We’ve been building Kon 57 records for basically the last year and a half, two years. Now we’re getting ready to launch on November 20th and couldn’t be more excited about it.\n\nWhat kind of propelled your choice to not go with a major label?\n\nYou know, everything that we built has been in our control, we’ve done it on our own. We worked at Fat Beats — J worked there for 5 or 6 years, I worked there for like 3 ½, 4 years – and, you know, we built Brown Bag on our own, and we built our solo stuff on our own. We've done our own marketing, and done our own PR and booking. Honestly, we've worked almost every part of this industry. We've worked so hard on it, that to basically hand it over to a label and not be in full control was just something that we didn’t feel would be right and worth all this work that we’ve been putting in. So we know that it’s more work, obviously doing it on our own, but in the long run, it’s better. We’re in full control, have all rights to everything, and nobody is going to be telling us how to make the music or when to put the music out.\n\nSo is it essentially a label? \n\nI mean, it is a label. We’re not signing any other artists or putting any other artists on; it’s just to put our stuff out. Hopefully in the future we get to a point that we’re at that we can help other artists out and put them on but for right now it’s just for our music.\n\nWhat’s your take on the current music scene in New York City?\n\nI think that the music industry now is lot stronger than it has been in recent years. I think that everything is looking good, and there are a lot of talented artists, a lot of avenues and a lot of people that are doing the right thing for it.\n\nWho are some of the artists that you’re checking for right now? \n\nJoey Badass, Action Bronson... As far as New York artists. And of course, you have Fetty Wap everywhere.\n\nYeah, he’s everywhere.[Laughing].\n\nHe’s from the East Coast, can’t hate on that from my end. I’ll be honest: I didn’t know that he was from Jersey when I first started hearing him. [Laughing]. But it’s dope that he is.\n\nDo you have any last words at all you’d like to share with our blog? Anything else we should be looking out for from you guys?\n\nI mean, we’re going to have the second single coming out in the next week or two, and we have the video for that. “The Fuel EP” drops November 20th and we’re excited. You can pre-order on iTunes right now. The video for “Porcelain” is out. It just broke 100,000 views, which is insane. I can’t thank everybody enough. And yeah, we’re just excited.\n\nPre-order The Fuel Today! You can also check our past interview with J57.",

As far as New York artists. And of course, you have Fetty Wap everywhere.\n\nYeah, he’s everywhere.[Laughing].\n\nHe’s from the East Coast, can’t hate on that from my end. I’ll be honest: I didn’t know that he was from Jersey when I first started hearing him. [Laughing]. But it’s dope that he is.\n\nDo you have any last words at all you’d like to share with our blog? Anything else we should be looking out for from you guys?\n\nI mean, we’re going to have the second single coming out in the next week or two, and we have the video for that. “The Fuel EP” drops November 20th and we’re excited. You can pre-order on iTunes right now. The video for “Porcelain” is out. It just broke 100,000 views, which is insane. I can’t thank everybody enough. And yeah, we’re just excited.\n\nPre-order The Fuel Today! You can also check our past interview with J57.",

    "content": "True art, especially in our industry, takes passion. There are ups and downs – and periods of limbo where artists need to either find their style, or themselves. When it clicks, it clicks, and everything always falls into place. NYC-based singer, actress and filmmaker Leigh Fitzjames, also known as Twinkles, knows this first hand. Her journey towards her upcoming full-length project has been interesting to say the least. From growing up in New Zealand, traveling her one-woman show, acting in various projects, producing a documentary to a lengthy limbo period where she anxiously awaited for her US visa to come through. She's now back in NYC, and working on making her dreams come to light.\n\nHer newest single In My Dreams is a haunting piano-driven blend of electro-R&B and raw emotion. It was produced by Flip Beatz, and mixed by Grammy-nominated engineer Lance Powell – whose worked with everyone from Wale to Miguel. Also – added cool factor – the super smooth track was recorded at Quad Studios, which you may recall was the infamous studio Tupac was leaving when he was shot the first time. That has nothing to do with Twinkles, but I had to mention it.\n\nCheck out our Q&A with Twinkles below. She's super interesting and worth checking out!\n\nTell me about your background\n\nI'm an artist from New Zealand. There weren't a lot of producers in my sphere, so I mostly did jazz and acoustic gigs for my time there before I moved to the States.\n\nHow did you get into singing?\n\nMy first performance was singing the national anthem in front of my junior school. It was a duet that went badly wrong. I was 11 at the time. I felt so bad that I started working as a basketball referee to save up money for music lessons! Took me five years of saving but when I started, my teachers helped me with finding performance opportunities and I started hanging out with older kids making drum and bass tracks. School went downhill from there.\n\nWho are some of your influences?\n\nMusically: D'Angelo, MJB. Also lyrical geniuses who put on good shows - Al Jarreau, Passion Pit...there are so many.\n\nCan you tell me about Love & Light, and Eight Limb Yoga?\n\nI call it \"yogatainment.\" Love and Light is a play I toured CAN and US, and Eight Limbs Yoga is a movie I shot in India/NZ/US and is still work in progress. They're both about how yoga has become stupidly commoditized. I'm super protective about things that empower people to be authentic vs. retail-sex driven bogus disguised as spirituality.\n\nYou mentioned in a vlog on your YouTube that in the period when you were working to come back to America, although you felt unsettled, you remained focused on releasing an album. What helped you maintain that focus?\n\nI focus on doing a little bit each day. Whether that's writing or following up with a collaborator, etc. It's the idea of making a new opportunity each day.\n\nAre you currently working on the album? \n\nI've made the first three tracks & vids for the EP that will be released in February, and then I'm working on more tunes to do the full album release after. Would be cool to get some big DJs to remix the current tracks and do some more producer collabos.\n\nWhat can we expect from it?\n\nAll the songs speak to \"in my dreams\" – hope and worry about the future. In My Dreams comes from me honestly believing any thing's possible (like combining classical baby grand with synths and submitting to major hip hop blogs). I know each possibility sounds like a silly dream, but I'm doing it anyway. That's the album - big ambitions that come with a \"sorry, not sorry\". Overall, though, it's a sweet sounding, a vocal driven blend of R&B/pop/hip-hop.\n\nDo you have any last words for our blog?\n\nAA++\n\nLearn more about her here.",

He wasn't the most prolific writer. It has long been known that much of his break-out debut album had been written a few years earlier by both Method Man and GZA, but who cares. ODB wasn't a Drake-esque figure. Nobody loved Dirty for what he said per say, but rather how he said it. In a see of urban figures that seemed to blend, A-son was an unmistakable and unforgettable character. He was charismatic (which is an understatement) and seemingly untameable. ODB was cut from a cloth that many rappers have tried and failed to imitate.\n\nFrom after losing out to Puffy, indecent exposure, or cinematic time on the lamb when he unexpectedly turned up at a Wu-Tang concert, he clearly did not give too many fucks. And classic footage of hI'm walking and in a limo is also quite revealing of his mindstate in the mid-nineties. A more telling side, though, was seen when Dirty wasn't, pardon my French, fucked up. Breaks in character, such as his classic unearthed interview below, reveal a man who loved his many children so much he damn near tears up while talking about them. His super downplayed shortly before his death showed how much he loved and valued his family. It also revealed his insecurities about being in jail. Essentially, he was just a man – under all the bravado and antics.\n\nHis legacy continues to live on, in part because his fans, family, and his Wu-Tang brethren keep it alive. Most recently, RZA and the wireless speaker company Boombotix have released a limited edition speaker, which contains a brand new unreleased ODB joint called Obey Me. RZA officially signed on with the San Francisco-based startup last year, giving hI'm an equity stake in the company and a hand in developing its line of rugged wireless speakers. They originally connected through one of the speaker brand's investors, and RZA and Boombotix's VP of Marketing, Mustafa Shaikh, conceptualized and released a limited edition Wu-Tang speaker with an unreleased Wu track at the top of the year – which understandably sold out in minutes.\n\nThis latest release came about when RZA mentioned to Mustafa that he may have some unreleased Dirty material laying around the basement on the Wu-Mansion. Just imagine having that conversation with RZA. Well, after a month of following-up, the Abbot went into the basement and unearthed some never-before-heard bars and sent them to Mustafa. “Imagine how I felt, opening the email, pressing play and being the first person to hear this new ODB music; It was surreal,” remarked Mustafa.\n\nMustafa tapped his friends at Fool’s Gold Records, and had Montreal-based producers Shash’u, and High Classified produce remixes to help package the new single, Obey Me, like an EP. “We're acting almost like a record label,” remarked Mustafa. Truly, it’s the most innovative way to sell a speaker ever! He and his team have accentuated the release by holding an ODB week, which was marked by the release of the single, a and a super cool app that allows you to make your ODB food stamp card and share it online. The week is coming to a head with a party in NYC, which will feature good music, good people, and live art – which will depict ODB at various ages in front of birthday cakes.\n\nODB, always claI'm there was no father to his style.

He’ll never be forgotten as long as real hip-hop still lives. This new single is just another notch on his legacy’s belt.

Cause wegoing to come up in'94, you best believe that!”\n\n– E.S.G, Rapper\n\nOn the intro to DJ Screw's 3 In Da Morning Part Two, rapper E.S.G warned that you should never – under any circumstance – take your eyes off your screw. The significance of that statement was rooted in a time that has long been forgotten in the sea of mainstream hip-hop and immediate media accessibility. It also leads us to the origins of a young DJ Screw, and the grassroots nature of 90's hip-hop that ingrained itself into our hearts. Simply put, it's why we treasure the era so much.\n\nIn the early days of Screw, around the time that his signatures slowed down and chopped up style was taking over the Houston streets, he made a hefty living making personalized tapes. It may be hard for a 90's born millennial to imagine the world where you couldn't just burn a compact disc, but if you wanted to have the newest and/or rarest new music, and you wanted t to have that Screw stank on it, you had to go to the man himself. Unfortunately – he's was one man. And as you may remember, dubbing a tape is an extremely manual process. So, to create order, clients were asked to pony up the cash, and provide a list with your contact and requests/shout outs, etc. That list found its way into a shoebox, and then you had to wait until Screw got around to it. Hopefully, that makes the \"watch your screw\" sentiment a bit more contextual for you. Of course, today these tapes are priceless to their owners. \n\nHave you ever had to search for music. I'm talking manual search. Vinyl heads and 90's collectors will agree that the experience of opening a package, and popping in a new album/single while taking in the packing and album credits is an unparalleled experience. It’s an experience that’s been all but lost at the hands of MP3s and the immediacy of digital media in today’s landscape. The glimmer of resurgence is beginning to take hold as a new generation become infatuated with owning any and everything on vinyl, and visionaries like RZA, and Boombotix, who are working to bring a sense of tangibility back to the music industry.\n\nThis week, as we celebrate the anniversary of DJ Screw’s passing, we should remember his influence and his carefree innovation that’s been loosely imitated by countless DJs – and artists – in popular culture. He’s a symbol of originality that is sorely lacking in the game – and, as well, a sad reminder that overindulgence in illicit substances can be fatal. Let’s all give a salute to the father of New “Screwston”, and the capo of the infamous Screwed Up Click.\n\nWatch Yo Screw!",

    "title": "Jadakiss – Top 5 Dead Or Alive Or Nah?",
    "content": "Jadakiss is a formidable voice in the rap game. He has a distinctive cadence that would stand out in a crowd of a million rappers, and a track record that dates back to the days when B.I.G had NYC – and hip-hop – on lock. He's often been quoted as claiming himself top 5 \"dead or alive,\" which he takes to the next level with his aptly titled album, Top 5 Dead Or Alive. Bold right? The question is, does the album live up to that name? Well, in my humble opinion, no. Is it a good album? Yes.\n\nI'll explain.\n\nAlmost ironically, the album's second song, The Shop Skit, has a group of men discussing his (Jada's) accolades while getting lined up. One man remarks that \"he can't just rely on bars anymore.\" Why is this ironic, well, because it unintentionally – or maybe intentionally – sets the tone for the album.

He has a distinctive cadence that would stand out in a crowd of a million rappers, and a track record that dates back to the days when B.I.G had NYC – and hip-hop – on lock. He's often been quoted as claiming himself top 5 \"dead or alive,\" which he takes to the next level with his aptly titled album, Top 5 Dead Or Alive. Bold right? The question is, does the album live up to that name? Well, in my humble opinion, no. Is it a good album? Yes.\n\nI'll explain.\n\nAlmost ironically, the album's second song, The Shop Skit, has a group of men discussing his (Jada's) accolades while getting lined up. One man remarks that \"he can't just rely on bars anymore.\" Why is this ironic, well, because it unintentionally – or maybe intentionally – sets the tone for the album.

    "title": "Whateva Man: An Interview With SoShy",
    "content": "There's something to be said for truly creative souls. You know, the ones who never stop thinking, never stop creating, and who's passion can never actually be extinguished. In this business, there are artists in it for the money and fame, and others who would do what they do, no matter what – because it's not what they do, but who they are. France-born and LA-based singer/songwriter SoShy is one such creative. Over the course of a phone interview I recently conducted with her, I could feel the passion in her voice.\n\nIf you're not familiar with her work, please know that she's by no means a new jack in this industry. She initially signed a deal with Sony music around a decade ago, which mainly developed her songwriting skills – and helped to break her in as a professional artist. After moving to LA (from NYC), she signed a deal with Universal, and more specifically, with Timbaland. Her deal was meant to be not only for her solo work but also for her to work with Timbo and Universal to craft material for other artists. She officially introduced to the world on the track Morning After Dark, which appeared on Tim's Shock Value 2 album.\n\nShe's since dropped her solo project, Crack The Code on a Montreal – Canada – based label, and made waves with the singles City Of Angels, and Whateva Man featuring Novel. In the midst of continuing to work with other artists on the writing side, and feverishly recording material for her upcoming album dropping in the New Year, she took some time out to talk with us here at AAHIPHOP. We chatted about everything from unreleased material with Mark Ronson, working with AZ, and more. Check out the interview below.\n\nDo you find it difficult to balance working with other artists, while still working on your music?\n\nNo, I don’t actually. Because one feeds the other. It took a while for me to find the dynamic in my writing. It’s about making sure that I don’t confuse both but, rather, keep them connected somehow so that whatever I can’t do for myself – because I need to keep my sound together – I can give to others.\n\nDo you find it kind of liberating in a sense, doing it for other people? Like, you can go places you wouldn’t necessarily go with your name or brand attached to it...\n\nThat's true. I think that it allows me to express myself in a way I couldn’t do with my own thing. It’s selfishly generous because in a way it feeds me – I kind of need to be needed. As an artist, if I'm true to myself, I need people to need me. I need to feel useful as an artist, as a vessel. At the same time, I just need to share things with others because I'm someone that’s going to die one day, and just want to make sure I can water certain seeds. Some of those seeds will serve certain artists, their journeys, and their situations. It’s very gratifying to do that, and yes, it’s therapeutic and liberating in a way.\n\nHave you ever had a weird experience where you were working on something for someone else, and became overly attached to it? \n\nIt's incredibly funny that you're asking me this question because this just happened. This is so weird right now; this is mystical. So, yes, I was working on an artist. I'm not going to say her name. I didn’t end up working for her because of a geographic reason. I was not able to make it to Portugal (she’s a local artist out there). I was asked to write a couple songs and see where it goes. There was one song that I wrote, and I was really in the middle of my own thing. So that was recent, let’s say a couple of months ago. This song that I wrote, honestly, I realized instantly that it was just too personal. Again, I'm not going to say too good; you know what I mean? Because yeah, I write for others what I would write for myself. It had the same energy and the same soul. But I was speaking from such a personal and very subjective standpoint that I was like, this thing is too much of my baby for me to let it go – and the artist agreed. It will probably end up on my new album.\n\nWhen you write for other people, do you often write from a personal place or do you just get to know them a bit and write something tailored for them?\n\nThe thing is, I didn’t get the chance this time to get to know the artist. It was a very cold order if you see what I mean. There was no human connection or interaction between the artist and me, because I think if that had happened, I would’ve probably really nailed it for the artist. I would’ve put myself in her shoes, and it didn’t happen like that. So I think that’s why I had more distance. Usually, I do need to interact with an artist.\n\nHow did you connect with AZ?\n\nI connected with AZ through Baby Paul (Paul Hendrix ). He's a producer who was involved in classic records by Nas, Smiff-and-Wessun, AZ and more. He was also an original member of the Beatminerz. So, I connected with them not because of AZ, but because of wanting to work together over Instagram. He hit me up. I didn’t know hI'm personally – he just said, we should just work together. It wasn’t really for my project, just in general. We did some tracks, and one of them was Back To Myself. I didn’t know where it was going to go. I had no idea. And so, he said, \"I want it to sound kind of like this song.\" He gave me a reference, whatever. I said, \"say no more.\" I took a couple days. I wrote the hook. The whole thing was really about coming back. It’s a redemption song but in a street way. When AZ heard it, he jumped on it.\n\nThat’s beautiful. This is probably really hard but who have been your favorite artists that you’ve worked with?\n\nThat I've worked with? Here's a few:\n\nMark Ronson was one of the people that I looked up to for a very long time. He wasn’t as big at the time. We're talking 2003. We did a few songs that we never released. They were amazing songs, and I think that at the time… but at that time, it wasn’t where we wanted to go. I know Mark felt where I was going to go as an artist. There was just a clash between the label and what we wanted to do in the lab with Mark. However, it was an amazing experience. We met in London a year after and we still keep in touch. We talked about making a record together. I wanted to have hI'm for my album.\n\nJohn Legend was a great experience. I wrote a song back when I was at Sony called Without You. It was supposed to be just for me. I was at epic and John was at Columbia at the time – he still is. He heard that, and he wanted to jump on the song. So we met in London, and we recorded – it was very flattering. I mean, it was an honor for me to have him. We’ve been very good friends since then. Estelle, too. Back in London I had the opportunity to work on her project.\n\nI mean obviously Timbaland. You know, I can’t forget about hI'm because he is a big influence. I grew up on his records. I grew up on Aaliyah, I grew up on Magoo and him, and Missy – and for me to be a part of that even for a couple years is a blessing for me. I aspire to be a producer too at some point; I'm working on it. Being able to be in the studio and watching hI'm at work was humbling to me.\n\nI love that you said Magoo, because no one ever says Magoo. He is the dopest; I don’t care what they…\n\nI don’t care what they say, dude. First of all, I will always stand for the underdog, number one, because I always feel like I'm one, too. But number two, I think he’s a dope rapper. He’s been very, very misunderstood. I think he’s dope. I don’t care what people say, he’s corny, he’s weird. I think he’s amazing. Whatever they did together, it worked.\n\nEvery time. Everything they did was on point.\n\nExactly, so underrated. I never leave hI'm out. I don’t know who else, I mean there’s so many – just working with AZ. AZ is a legend; you know what I'm saying? AZ is not lazy. He’s a hardworking guy. He’s one of those underrated artists. I'm telling you, his comeback, his book he just released, and the Doe Or Die anniversary album... He’s back in a major way. It’s dope to have worked with him.\n\nI also have to talk about Novel. Novel is a producer; he produced for Alicia Keys, Leona Lewis, and more. We’re talking big songs. He’s an amazing, rapper, singer. He produced a couple records of mine, including the song Whateva Man. He’s one of the people that mentored me and helped me understand music in different ways. I'm very blessed to know him. It’s humbling to be recognized and acknowledged. I probably forgot people because... I've had a chance to work with a lot of amazing artists, so yeah.\n\nWhat do you want people to take away from your music? What do you want people that don’t know about you to know about you?\n\nI don’t know if there’s anything I want them to know about me except for the fact that I'm truly genuine with what I do. Every time I'm going to release a song, it’s going to be extremely real to me and also true to the reality and the world I live in. I wouldn’t call myself a conscious artist, but I'm a conscious person. Meaning, when I write something, it has to be conscious. We cannot just talk about flowers and rainbows. At the same time, I completely don’t commend all the gangster rap and any gangster shit that’s going on. Whether it’s in hip-hop, rock or anything. I just want to heal people. I want them to feel better about themselves. I want to empower them. I'm trying to be a vessel here. I don't want people to watch me shine. I'm trying to bring some light and bring some truth, and honestly, that's the only thing that I want people to say about me.",

    "title": "Diversify Your Portfolio: Interview With Son of Tony",
    "content": "History has shown that the most successful artists in hip-hop history have worn multiple hats. Whether that means heading label, businesses (like Rick Ross’ Wing Stop for example) – or even making a go at other forms of media such as film, TV or radio. In today’s fickle marketplace, and as hip-hop/music has evolved into a billion dollar industry, not diversifying your portfolio seems almost irresponsible, especially if your goals involve longevity and financial stability.\n\nMeet Son of Tony, whose stage name is in loving memory of his late father. He's quite an interesting artist – especially when we're talking about \"diversity.\" Aside from multiple releases, including his most recent The Son And His Father, he’s also a veteran radio host in Ohio, who helped start and co-host Flip & Flex Radio, and Xclusive Vibe Radio on Power 109.9. He’s a well-rounded cat, with a determination to get his messages out to the masses – by any means necessary. AAHIPHOP caught up with hI'm to chat about his career and his latest music. Check the interview below.\n\nHow did you get involved in hip-hop music?\n\nI got involved in music through my family. Always hearing what they were playing around me – and songs that caught my attention during big scenes in movies. It helped to influence me. I started writing at ten. I just never saw myself serious about it until 2014. The most natural gift I have, I never chased. I got involved in music to change my life. Something in my confidence changed. I just know I make the kind of music that can compete with what's being played today.\n\nYou're an interesting artist because you're also an established radio personality. How does that influence your approach to music?\n\nRadio changed my approach to music. I listened to so many submissions for the station, I heard so much lack of respect, copycatting, and false promotion of the unworthy, I set out to change that. I focused on releasing a project I knew would get a response. I hosted a radio show on Power 1099, Flip & Flex radio, in Ohio last year called Xclusive Vibe Radio. This was a significant turning point for me. Not just because of the profession or listeners, but because of what was being said in so much of the music. So, I started writing and recording about my life. It's personal, it's Hip-Hop, but I’m in it for the money and the opportunities. Somebody, somewhere, can relate to at least one song on the project. It was written with a worldly view. Having radio and product to sell is a force to be acknowledged. It changes the odds a little.\n\nHow did you get into radio? What is your take on the role radio plays in today's hip-hop landscape?\n\nWhat radio considers to be hot today is not a true reflection of the total climate of Hip-Hop. It focuses more on sound, hook, dance, and fashion. Not substance. Not the message. Sometimes we have to remind people that Hip-Hop originates from the streets of New York. That Hip-Hop will always belong to the streets. No matter how much globalization you attach to it. This music landscape is fickle. So many underground artists never get the shot for that great talent because it's about how much can be made off you and your image. It's about money, not talent. And this makes it tougher for us all.\n\nTell me about The Father & His Son project.\n\nThe Son And His Father Tape is different. The aggression. The beat selection. The content. For a debut project, it's incredibly versatile, while remaining true to the messages. It's real life. It's cinematic. It's violent without overkill. Raw and honest. My life put out there for all to hear. The pain and glory of it all. Somebody has to carry the torch for the people who make music this generation can relate to. So many concepts to choose from. Any one song is full of discussion matter. They will all understand the strength of this project in due time. There’s a lot of new music that’s out to compete with. I'm holding steady. \n\nWhat are your goals as a music artist?\n\nMy goal is to reach the underdog. The downtrodden. The abused and forgotten. The poor and rich alike, though. There're levels to my music. I want to sell out arenas. Collab with greats who helped to mold the culture. I want to be known as one of the authentics. The one with original style, sound, and subject matter. In short, I just want to be the best artist I can be, without selling my soul. That's not negotiable.\n\nDo you see yourself remaining independent – or pursuing a major deal? Do you think labels still matter in 2015?\n\nWho's to say if the right situation comes along that I won't sign with a major. Until then, I’m independent. I'm unsigned. I'm hungry. If you’re not in this for the money, why be here? I'm writing, recording, and performing until I amass a fortune. And yes, labels still matter. Those are machines with all the avenues and unlimited resources, but independent still matters too. We still set trends and the \"bar\" as well.\n\nDo you have any last words you'd like to leave our readers with?\n\nBe sure to check out The Son And His Father tape, now on iTunes, Apple Music, Google play, Amazon, Datpiff, etc. and follow me on Twitter at @SonofTonyUSSR \nNew visual on <a href=\" Peace.",
    "clean_content": "History has shown that the most successful artists in hip-hop history have worn multiple hats. Whether that means heading label, businesses (like Rick Ross’ Wing Stop for example) – or even making a go at other forms of media such as film, TV or radio. In today’s fickle marketplace, and as hip-hop/music has evolved into a billion dollar industry, not diversifying your portfolio seems almost irresponsible, especially if your goals involve longevity and financial stability.\n\nMeet Son of Tony, whose stage name is in loving memory of his late father. He's quite an interesting artist – especially when we're talking about \"diversity.\" Aside from multiple releases, including his most recent The Son And His Father, he’s also a veteran radio host in Ohio, who helped start and co-host Flip & Flex Radio, and Xclusive Vibe Radio on Power 109.9. He’s a well-rounded cat, with a determination to get his messages out to the masses – by any means necessary. AAHIPHOP caught up with hI'm to chat about his career and his latest music. Check the interview below.\n\nHow did you get involved in hip-hop music?\n\nI got involved in music through my family. Always hearing what they were playing around me – and songs that caught my attention during big scenes in movies. It helped to influence me. I started writing at ten. I just never saw myself serious about it until 2014. The most natural gift I have, I never chased. I got involved in music to change my life. Something in my confidence changed. I just know I make the kind of music that can compete with what's being played today.\n\nYou're an interesting artist because you're also an established radio personality. How does that influence your approach to music?\n\nRadio changed my approach to music. I listened to so many submissions for the station, I heard so much lack of respect, copycatting, and false promotion of the unworthy, I set out to change that. I focused on releasing a project I knew would get a response. I hosted a radio show on Power 1099, Flip & Flex radio, in Ohio last year called Xclusive Vibe Radio.

Although all three of the artists within this music collective have unique personalities and approaches, they all share an immense love for psychoactive substances. In fact, they have it listed as a musical influence, leading the collective to develop a dark, expressive and laid back sound. This sound can be heard throughout their new EP, Contact High, which is due to drop New Year’s Eve – great news for y’all smokers out there.\n\nThe EP, which sits at a mere five tracks, gives a great introduction to the trio, who bob and weave over bassy, trunk rattling production. It’s the sound, quite frankly, I've come to expect from Texas (not a bad thing). True to their mantra, they don’t stray too far from hazy rhymes that are so potent, you’d think you could smell the OG Kush through the speakers. The guys shine especially hard over the dark production in Colorado, which sounds like an audio road trip to the state that grossed so much money after legalizing marijuana, they’re developing ways to give some of it back. It's their modern-day mecca. My fave joint here is the slightly more uptempo/bouncy Set The Record, where they explain: \"Don’t keep many friends because they all become enemies in the end.” It’s all about crew love. \n\nI’d love to see them try some slightly different production, just to hear how their chemistry, which they’ve seemed to perfect on this EP, reacts. TBR Music Group are relative newcomers, but their careers go back quite a long way; and even before joining forces, each member of the group boasted an impressive background. When asked about working as solo artists, the crew explains, \"when musicians join forces for the sake of producing great, uncompromising work, anything can happen.”\n\nTouché.

    "title": "Special's Top 5 Albums Of 2015",
    "content": "First things first, I hate lists. I'm not a fan of \"countdowns\" around this time of year, as they're WAY too subjective in nature, and often result in tons of shade from other fans, writers and – well – urban Twitter on a whole. For this reason, I'll simply be sharing a list of five albums I found significant this year. Please note, this is my personal top-five, and may not necessarily reflect the entire team. I'll share some of the how and why along the way, as well.\n\nHere they are, in no particular order:\n\nAction Bronson – Mr. Wonderful\n\nDoes Action Bronson sound like Ghostface? Yes, kind of. Do I care? No! Much like Shyne, he has little control over his vocal cadence. So what other obstacles do you have blocking you from enjoying this man's music? Exactly.\n\nDo yourself a favour and give hI'm an honest listen. I first got into Bronson off of SAAB Stories and then began digging through his past catalogue. More than his music, though, his overall brand is on point. From his Fuck That's Delicious series – and – his videos in general to his upcoming book, he's using what used to be a hobby to help hI'm fuel his true passion, which is food/cooking.\n\nMr. Wonderful is a dope listen to cover to cover. From dropping salty-ex boyfriend slang on Blue Eyes with Chance The Rapper and skating the fine line of mainstream hip-hop with the 40 produced Actin' Crazy to the dreamy flow of Terry, he delivers a well-balanced meal for the real heads –flavourful, with tons of spice. See what I did there?\n\nWale – The Album About Nothing\n\nI was into this album before it even dropped, just because of the promotional campaign. The videos with Jerry Seinfeld on WorldStar, the spread in Complex – it spoke volumes about what we can/should expect from Wale. From the beginning, his affiliations always painted a vivid picture of the hype that surrounded this man, from his early collaboration with Lady Gaga (when she was at the top of her shit), to this relationship he'd seemingly struck up with one of the wealthiest and more respected comedians in the game. Wale is at that level, so not taking one of his releases seriously seems irresponsible on our part.\n\nThat's the message he projects, anyways.\n\nThis album was underrated in my opinion. I felt like I didn't see enough chatter about it. When I tell you that I could not stop singing The White Shoes in my head for the latter part of the year, I'm not exaggerating. The album cleverly uses monologues and conversations with Jerry, and clips from the show as a jump off points for an honest, and at times heartfelt, collection of music. Covering topics that range from marriage to police brutality, This album is another cover to cover kind of project. Recommended listening includes: The Glass Egg, The Girls On Drugs, and The Pessimist featuring J.Cole.\n\nJoey Badass – B4D A$$\n\nEvery generation needs a Nas and Joey kind of fits that mould. It takes a special kind of artist to get DJ Premier school-girl-giddy hyped – just saying. Not that nobody else under 25 was on the wave, but Pro Era has certainly made it cool as fuck for kids to excavate the 90's and mine that nostalgic sound into their records. From the first time you hear Waves, you just knew this kid was special. B4D A$$ was highly anticipated, and rightfully so; the album lived up to the hype, and gave fans exactly what they wanted: realness.\n\nIf you can honestly listen to Paper Trails and Big Dusty, or – shit – even Save The Children (which kicks-off the album), and tell me he isn't talented as hell, then we can't be friends. The album sounds like Joey built a time machine and recorded it in a dusty NYC basement circa 90's aesthetically, yet it's relevant, immediate and oddly innovative. This kid is only 20, wrap your mind around the damage he's going to over the next decade.\n\nStop blaming kids for killing hip-hop...\n\nKendrick Lamar – To Pimp A Butterfly \n\nKendrick Lamar is a difficult artist to listen to – for me anyways. I like to immerse myself in the culture but am often turned off by things that have too much hype surrounding them, à la Drake for example. Maybe it's the perpetual hater in me. As a writer, I often feel like I don't need to convince or cast too much opinion on universally accepted norms because yawn (what's the point). What I'm getting at, is that I feel like not liking Kendrick means something is wrong with you, because he's the best. It's hard to walk into his music objectively.\n\nThis album, though, was brilliant. It was – in all honesty – a brutal listen. It was powerful, and at points uncomfortable; however, it was honest, and ridiculously well executed. He refuses to sit idly amongst the rocky climate of today's reality on the streets of America. While some artists within the circumference of his apex may decide to make \"art\" that seems to serve as lifestyle branded commercials for opulence many of us will never experience, Kendrick did a great job of showing not only his artistic range but his ability to swI'm upstream (so to speak) and not get his crown wet. It's a must-listen, period.\n\nLupe Fiasco – Tetsuo & Youth\n\nLupe Fiasco has certainly had a frustrating go at music over the past few years. Honestly, I'm not afraid to say I hated Lasers. It felt very watered down and lacked pretty much everything I loved about Lupe on his debut and The Cool. He seemed to lose his way, and to add injury to insult; it sold amazingly well. This album, though, Tetsuo & Youth, was his opus – and seemed to display a Lupe that real heads who have been watching hI'm for years knew he could be. I liken hI'm to Goku, powering up in the mountains before becoming a super-sayan.\n\nThe album is daring, immensely detail-rich, and devoid of any overbearing need for commercial recognition. It's artistic, inspiring and a must-listen for artists and \"real\" heads alike. Lupe plans on releasing 3 albums in 2016, so let's hope he stays in this lane for the whole trip.\n\nEarly. [drops mic]\n\nRunners-Up\n\nDrake – If You're Reading This It's Too Late\n\nI can't front, this album, which Aubrey dropped out of nowhere, is hype as hell. If you exist – and like hip-hop – you've heard this album, and don't require my co-sign. I just wanted you all to know that I'm not a hater, even though I fail to recognize Drake very often here on the blog.\n\nHe doesn't need me – at all.\n\nPusha T – Darkest Before Dawn\n\nJust dropped a review of this album last week. It deserves all the recognition it gets, and I can attest that everything you've heard about it is the truth. Pusha T delivers his best project to date. Get your hands on this ASAP (like Rocky).\nWhat were your fave albums of 2015? Tweet me and let me know!",

    "content": "\"Once you're legendary, you're going to be legendary regardless. But, you've got to switch it up. I don’t want to be stuck in that...with my beats sounding like dinosaurs.\"\n\n-- VDon\n\nThe digitization of the industry has changed the way we interact with the elements that go into making the music we all love – notably the artistic credits. Often we can go through a large number of (digital) tracks, many improperly tagged, without becoming overtly aware of the hands behind the boards making your head nod. As well, streaming services like Spotify and Deezer fail to detail the production credits correctly. Maybe that's what helps young producers like the Harlem-based VDon stay so humble. Although he's not (yet) a household name, he has a resume that most producers will live – and die – without topping. So far, he's worked with names like Bodega Bamz,,,,, and many more.\n\nI recently had a wonderful chat with VDon, discussing his background, his 2016 aspirations, and his latest EP, The Opiate – featuring,, and others.\n\nCheck out the interview below, and grab The Opiate here.\n\nHow did you get into producing?\n\nI got into it because my pops was a local DJ. He always had equipment around me, like keyboards, drums – that’s how pretty much I started. He used to try to teach me how to make beats when I was around 12-13, but I just wasn’t interested at the time. I didn’t get into it until I moved out of New York. I moved down south for about three years. I was bored out there because I'm from the city, so going down south was a different pace. I started making beats; I was sending my beats to my friends back in New York, and they were telling me, \"you got talent, you need to keep it going.\"\n\nWho was the first artist you produced for?\n\nThe first artist? Well, there were two that happened around the same time. I did a track with Jae Mills (YMCMB), and I did a track with Ransom.\n\nHow did you connect with them? When you first started doing it, was it just you going around handing out beat tapes, that sort of thing?\n\nI was doing that, and back then when I first started, I had a partner. We were like a professional duo. We would make beat tapes and hand them out; we would also get into studios. We knew people from the streets too, so that led us to meet lots of artists. Harlem is a small place...\n\nIt’s interesting because I'm in Toronto, but I’ve been to New York a lot. People don’t realize that it’s a big city, but it’s a small place at the same time.\n\nYeah, New York is just the scene man. That’s another reason I moved back too; I knew I had to work towards getting the artists I wanted to work with, so, I moved back. You know just being out in the city you're going to bump into rappers, you're going to bump into people. That’s pretty much it. In the music scene, everyone knows somebody through one person or another.\n\nWhat’s your process? Do you sell a beat and walk away? Are you hands on?\n\nNow that I got my studio in the Bronx, I like to be hands on. I mean, if the artist is in another state – and it’s my homie – I hit them up and send music over email. Lately, though, I’ve liked having artists see me in person, you know, especially if we’re in the same city.\n\nThat's a whole different experience.\n\nIt’s a different vibe when you're there with the artist, sharing ideas with each other. As far as making the beats, I like to be by myself creating/preparing them –and then when the artist comes through I just playing a bunch of stuff I have. I can make beats on the spot too.\n\nCan you talk a little bit about The Opiate?\n\nThe Opiate is pretty much a compilation of all the artists I’ve been working with for the last 2 to 3 years. I just decided instead of me being on everybody else’s projects, giving them beats, let me put together my EP. It just happened that we had extra songs that artists didn’t use for their projects, so I ended up keeping them, and as well, I had collaborators come into the studio to sit down and work with me. I just molded how I wanted it to sound. It's a showcase of my beats really.\n\nWhich is dope, I like that. I like the emphasis on the producer.\n\nYeah, I appreciate it. Thank you.\n\nSo what else are you working on? What else do you have in the works?\n\nI got a few tracks with Dave East that are unreleased, I'm trying to do a project with him, and I'm attempting to work on a project with my boy Dark Lo from Philly – we’ve been talking about doing something. And top of 2016, I'm aiming to get some high profile placements. You know, I'm trying to continue doing EPs. I don’t want just to do one track on somebody’s mixtape anymore. I'd like to handle most of their production; you know what I mean? I’m looking forward to working with new artists too.\n\nWould you more prefer to focus on one artist? That changes the vibe of an artist...\n\nThat’s really what I want to do for the majority of 2016. I think that’s how a producer gets an identity and how they can separate you from other producers. I enjoy doing that. I like doing a whole project. This past year I just did Bodega Bamz's Sidewalk Exec project, I produced the whole thing; I'm trying to do some more work like that.\n\nWho are some of your favorite artists you worked with thus far.\n\nI like working with Bodega Bam. We click together. Dave East, he works fast. Really, like all the artists on The Opiate, I have good chemistry with. That’s why I chose them to be on my project.\n\nWhat are some of your goals as a producer? So do you see yourself maybe getting into like film or other avenues at all?\n\nI would love to; I would love to get into film because I'm a big movie head. I know every classic film, I got every movie. So definitely like ultimate goal would be to score a movie. And as far as being a producer, yeah, I would like to be mentioned with the greats, the great hip-hop producers, I want my name on that list, you know?\n\nHere’s the hard question. Who would be your top producers?\n\nTop 5?\n\nThat’s hard as hell, I know.\n\nIt is. I would have to say, Alchemist, Dr. Dre, Timbaland, Pharell…\n\nIf you notice, a lot of the producers you mentioned are producers that did film scoring – and did mad other shit. They went to a whole other level. Like Alchemist with Gangrene, you know, doing the score for GTA.\n\nOh yeah, and Pharell is a genius. He’s like the new Quincy Jones; he’s going to be around forever. Would want to take it there, you know.\n\nSo what else do you have coming?\n\nI have some videos coming up from The Opiate, top of the year.\n\nWhat tracks do you have videos for?\n\nRight now, the Dark Lo track, The Message. Honestly, I'm trying to shoot everything off the project, so you want to look out for new videos. I also have new drum kits coming out, new sounds. Just be on the lookout for upcoming projects man.\n\nYou know, before I learned about you, I'd heard some of your stuff before, but just didn’t realize it was you.\n\nThat’s basically what I'm trying to do right now, let people know who I am. People probably heard my stuff, but they didn’t know I did it.\n\nIt’s hard; that’s the hard part about being a producer.\n\nThe producer is stuck in a cut – behind the scenes.\n\nYeah, you got to look for it; you've got to know to look for it. Like Dre, you just know Dre did it. If you're making a Dre track, you make a point of telling everybody it’s a Dre track. Artists don’t do that for just anyone.\n\nYeah, he broke so many artists. He started a lot of things; a lot of times you need to work with an artist that’s going to push your name like that. A lot of these new artists, they get what they get from you, and they keep on pushing rather than trying to build. Metro Boomin', he got a bunch of people—he got fire, but he also got a bunch of people pushing hI'm too.\n\nAbsolutely. As a producer you've got to have the foresight to kind of say, \"I think these people are going to make incredible, amazing shit.\" Like Metro Boomin' is in a good place because a lot of artists he worked with just exploded. Like 40's in a great place because Drake just went bonkers, you know what I mean?\n\nExactly. Like me, I'm a little bit all over the place because I work with so many different artists, but I think that’s going to push me forward. When I came in the game, I was doing a lot of stuff for Vado. I did a majority of his first couple of mixtapes. But then, I don’t know, we just went our ways.\n\nYou never know.\n\nI'm not mad at him, just you know…\n\nYou just got to have foresight. That’s what it is. All The Opiate artists, you just click with. But, you’ll do tracks with some people, and they’ll be aight, but it just won’t click.\n\nYeah, sometimes you just got to find that right… like you said, foresight man; but, sometimes you can have the wrong foresight.\n\nIt's also work ethic.\n\nAnd, the game is just different now. Shit’s different. You'll be cool one day – and then it switches up the next. That’s why I choose to work with various artists too because I don’t want to be stuck working with an artist that just ups and leaves. I don’t want to be looking at the wall like \"This nigga shitted on me.\" Shit’s crazy, man.\n\nThat happens. Look at Guru, before he died, everything he put out was done by Solaar. He dumped Premo...who dumps Premo?\n\nHe shitted on hI'm man. That’s how you know shit wasn’t right. Even other artists shitted on him; Jay-Z, he just stopped working with hI'm out of nowhere, onto the new.\n\nThat’s the progression of hip-hop, too.\n\nPremo doesn’t change; I mean, once you're legendary, you're going to be legendary regardless. But, you've got to switch it up. I don’t want to be stuck in that shit with my beats sounding like dinosaurs.\n\nWell, it’s a different day. Things come in cycles. If you're a producer that was stuck on 90s shit – and you just didn’t leave that vibe – this is a good time for you right now, you know what I mean?\n\nI got a little bit of the old stuff in my beats mixed in with the new things. I can do trap drums and shit like that, blend it in…I'm just trying to do whatever sounds good to me. Got to stay relevant.\n\nAbsolutely. You got to stay relevant and just be like 5 percent innovative. You've just go to be different enough; you know what I mean? So you don’t get bogged down. If you're a creative soul, making the same thing all the time will kill you after a while.\n\nIt gets boring. You got to add more to it. Sometimes you might need a break so that you can come back hard. It’s all about who raps on your shit. It all goes back to that again. What’s the Pusha joint called? Untouchable. Like alright, to me, the beat is fire, but you need a rapper on it. Not just anyone could kill that beat.\n\nYeah, that whole album was on fire – incredible.\n\nYeah, I'm glad somebody did it, man, because rap is terrible right now.\n\nExactly!\n\nI'm glad somebody did it. Someone on that level… yeah. I think that’s regular fire to me. His album, a lot of people are supposed to be doing that. That’s what people are supposed to be doing, but rap changed. It’s not even all the way rap now, it’s just a bunch of genres just blended, you know what I mean?\n\nAbsolutely.\n\nAs far as a rap album, that’s an excellent album.\n\nThat’s the best album I’ve heard in a long time. He’s just straight up bars.\n\nYeah, people think you can't rap anymore. You can rap, but you just got make it sound good. Pusha T makes it look good. He's got good videos, he’s fresh, he’s talking about real topics. You just got to make it look appealing. I like the Schoolboy Q's album too that shit was pretty dope.\n\nI liked that as well. TDE in general.\n\nThey're like the new people that’s running rap, man. That’s what New York is supposed to be sounding like, TDE shit; but, nobody wants to say that, nobody wants to admit that. People want to do shit the same old way they were doing it, but that’s not going to work, anymore.",

And top of 2016, I'm aiming to get some high profile placements. You know, I'm trying to continue doing EPs. I don’t want just to do one track on somebody’s mixtape anymore. I'd like to handle most of their production; you know what I mean? I’m looking forward to working with new artists too.\n\nWould you more prefer to focus on one artist? That changes the vibe of an artist...\n\nThat’s really what I want to do for the majority of 2016. I think that’s how a producer gets an identity and how they can separate you from other producers. I enjoy doing that. I like doing a whole project. This past year I just did Bodega Bamz's Sidewalk Exec project, I produced the whole thing; I'm trying to do some more work like that.\n\nWho are some of your favorite artists you worked with thus far.\n\nI like working with Bodega Bam. We click together. Dave East, he works fast. Really, like all the artists on The Opiate, I have good chemistry with. That’s why I chose them to be on my project.\n\nWhat are some of your goals as a producer? So do you see yourself maybe getting into like film or other avenues at all?\n\nI would love to; I would love to get into film because I'm a big movie head. I know every classic film, I got every movie. So definitely like ultimate goal would be to score a movie. And as far as being a producer, yeah, I would like to be mentioned with the greats, the great hip-hop producers, I want my name on that list, you know?\n\nHere’s the hard question. Who would be your top producers?\n\nTop 5?\n\nThat’s hard as hell, I know.\n\nIt is. I would have to say, Alchemist, Dr. Dre, Timbaland, Pharell…\n\nIf you notice, a lot of the producers you mentioned are producers that did film scoring – and did mad other shit. They went to a whole other level. Like Alchemist with Gangrene, you know, doing the score for GTA.\n\nOh yeah, and Pharell is a genius. He’s like the new Quincy Jones; he’s going to be around forever. Would want to take it there, you know.\n\nSo what else do you have coming?\n\nI have some videos coming up from The Opiate, top of the year.\n\nWhat tracks do you have videos for?\n\nRight now, the Dark Lo track, The Message. Honestly, I'm trying to shoot everything off the project, so you want to look out for new videos. I also have new drum kits coming out, new sounds. Just be on the lookout for upcoming projects man.\n\nYou know, before I learned about you, I'd heard some of your stuff before, but just didn’t realize it was you.\n\nThat’s basically what I'm trying to do right now, let people know who I am. People probably heard my stuff, but they didn’t know I did it.\n\nIt’s hard; that’s the hard part about being a producer.\n\nThe producer is stuck in a cut – behind the scenes.\n\nYeah, you got to look for it; you've got to know to look for it. Like Dre, you just know Dre did it. If you're making a Dre track, you make a point of telling everybody it’s a Dre track. Artists don’t do that for just anyone.\n\nYeah, he broke so many artists. He started a lot of things; a lot of times you need to work with an artist that’s going to push your name like that. A lot of these new artists, they get what they get from you, and they keep on pushing rather than trying to build. Metro Boomin', he got a bunch of people—he got fire, but he also got a bunch of people pushing hI'm too.\n\nAbsolutely. As a producer you've got to have the foresight to kind of say, \"I think these people are going to make incredible, amazing shit.\" Like Metro Boomin' is in a good place because a lot of artists he worked with just exploded. Like 40's in a great place because Drake just went bonkers, you know what I mean?\n\nExactly. Like me, I'm a little bit all over the place because I work with so many different artists, but I think that’s going to push me forward. When I came in the game, I was doing a lot of stuff for Vado. I did a majority of his first couple of mixtapes. But then, I don’t know, we just went our ways.\n\nYou never know.\n\nI'm not mad at him, just you know…\n\nYou just got to have foresight. That’s what it is. All The Opiate artists, you just click with. But, you’ll do tracks with some people, and they’ll be aight, but it just won’t click.\n\nYeah, sometimes you just got to find that right… like you said, foresight man; but, sometimes you can have the wrong foresight.\n\nIt's also work ethic.\n\nAnd, the game is just different now. Shit’s different. You'll be cool one day – and then it switches up the next. That’s why I choose to work with various artists too because I don’t want to be stuck working with an artist that just ups and leaves. I don’t want to be looking at the wall like \"This nigga shitted on me.\" Shit’s crazy, man.\n\nThat happens. Look at Guru, before he died, everything he put out was done by Solaar. He dumped Premo...who dumps Premo?\n\nHe shitted on hI'm man. That’s how you know shit wasn’t right. Even other artists shitted on him; Jay-Z, he just stopped working with hI'm out of nowhere, onto the new.\n\nThat’s the progression of hip-hop, too.\n\nPremo doesn’t change; I mean, once you're legendary, you're going to be legendary regardless. But, you've got to switch it up. I don’t want to be stuck in that shit with my beats sounding like dinosaurs.\n\nWell, it’s a different day. Things come in cycles. If you're a producer that was stuck on 90s shit – and you just didn’t leave that vibe – this is a good time for you right now, you know what I mean?\n\nI got a little bit of the old stuff in my beats mixed in with the new things. I can do trap drums and shit like that, blend it in…I'm just trying to do whatever sounds good to me. Got to stay relevant.\n\nAbsolutely. You got to stay relevant and just be like 5 percent innovative. You've just go to be different enough; you know what I mean? So you don’t get bogged down. If you're a creative soul, making the same thing all the time will kill you after a while.\n\nIt gets boring. You got to add more to it. Sometimes you might need a break so that you can come back hard. It’s all about who raps on your shit. It all goes back to that again. What’s the Pusha joint called? Untouchable. Like alright, to me, the beat is fire, but you need a rapper on it. Not just anyone could kill that beat.\n\nYeah, that whole album was on fire – incredible.\n\nYeah, I'm glad somebody did it, man, because rap is terrible right now.\n\nExactly!\n\nI'm glad somebody did it. Someone on that level… yeah. I think that’s regular fire to me. His album, a lot of people are supposed to be doing that. That’s what people are supposed to be doing, but rap changed. It’s not even all the way rap now, it’s just a bunch of genres just blended, you know what I mean?\n\nAbsolutely.\n\nAs far as a rap album, that’s an excellent album.\n\nThat’s the best album I’ve heard in a long time. He’s just straight up bars.\n\nYeah, people think you can't rap anymore. You can rap, but you just got make it sound good. Pusha T makes it look good. He's got good videos, he’s fresh, he’s talking about real topics. You just got to make it look appealing. I like the Schoolboy Q's album too that shit was pretty dope.\n\nI liked that as well. TDE in general.\n\nThey're like the new people that’s running rap, man. That’s what New York is supposed to be sounding like, TDE shit; but, nobody wants to say that, nobody wants to admit that. People want to do shit the same old way they were doing it, but that’s not going to work, anymore.",

    "content": "\"It’s the wavelengths, bro, that change over time because nothing stops moving -- including people. Niggas get older; new people take their place.\"\n\n-- Kidaf\n\nThe next generation of hip-hop is coming of age as of late, and the future of the genre is bright. Not to say there wasn't always youngins in the game, but the industry is a transitional state, and a new breed of artists armed with a true sense of golden era asthetic – and a built in digital marketing compass – are reclaiming the elements that had many of us older heads fall in love with the back in it's hay day. Furthermore, these new rappers are seemingly a buffer, allowing some of the older/jaded ears to take in some of the newer influences they may otherwise sleep on. There are a number of soldiers leading this brigade, many of whom I've featured here. Today, though, I want to introduce Loaf Muzik, a Brooklyn hip-hop collective consisting of members Oso Dope, Kidaf, Shine Sinatra, and Shadow The Great.\n\nAll in their early 20's, these cats are remarkably self-aware, and seem to have found their artistic focus/foundation quite early on. With their new mixtape, Live From The Dungeon, their collaborative release with Harry Freud, Camo Assassin, and their work with Team Backpack, their work ethic is showing – and for now, it's all in-house.\n\nThe guys were kind enough to sit down with AAHIPHOP to talk about their music, their influences and more. Check out the interview below, and get familiar!\n\n(L--R: Shadow The Great, Oso Dope, Kidaf, Shine Sinatra)\n\nTalk a little bit about first how you got into hip-hop and then we’ll get into Loaf Muzik and how that came together...\nOSO: I got into hip hop pretty much just opening up my eyes to my surroundings and my neighborhood where I was growing up. You know, here in people’s apartments and across the street somebody else had they speaker outside their 7th-floor apartment; hearing people compete for the loudest speaker, facing the window, hearing that soul. That bass line, those drums, at the park, on every single corner. That’s where my hip-hop experience began, literally just growing up taking a detour around the neighborhood and stuff like that. Also, video games that had mad brand new tracks on them. I would play the games just to listen and bump the tracks, every word, things like that. That’s how I started knowing about different MCs.\n\nShine: In all truth, it was Shadow, he exposed me to it. He showed me everything about it. Whether it was the lyricism or DJing or, you know, b-boying, I just started to expand my knowledge about it. It just caught my attention; you know what I mean? I got put onto like all these artists and at the time, I was like maybe 14 or 15. Listening to dudes that grew up in the same city I grew up in. Relating to them in a certain type of way because of what they're saying. Listening in to them, also to the drums, the bass line, the low end. It was just like, so captivating. You got all these dope ass lyricists who come from the same area in reality. You got Big Pun from Queens, Biggie from Brooklyn and all these dope ass artists – but they're all New York artists. It was like, knowing that all these guys grew up in the same city that I'm growing up in—it was crazy. Being 14, knowing that. It was dope.\n\nKidaf: How I fell in love with hip-hop? It’s a very particular story, bro. My brother had just turned 18; he copped a fucking Lincoln LS, some burgundy shit. I went inside, and he was playing a Big L and Jay-Z freestyle. It was a 9-minute long freestyle. I heard hip hop before but I had never heard nobody kill it like that. Ever since I heard that, I just fell in love with the art. And then with the art comesthe culture. You just feel all these people just doing what they want to do in a world where that’s pretty hard, you know what I'm saying? It was attractive to me, even as a young kid. Now that I’m older, I still have that same mind state – do it yourself. In 2016 everybody got their movement.\n\nSo how did you guys come together? Did you guys go to the same school? How did you guys meet and decide to form Loaf Muzik?\n\nKidaf: Through music and school, bro. Education is secondary to it, though. I knew Shadow in middle school; he was living in Brooklyn. It was like a community thing. I was living all the way in Queens. I was fucking with his shit, he was fucking with mine, and then we linked up – and we started making music together. It sounds pretty straightforward, but it was dope the way everything came together.\n\nOSO: The simplest form of it was pretty much… I knew Shine from the neighborhood, and I also knew Shadow from the neighborhood. It was like \"I’m going to rep your shit, you're going to rep my shit,\" that’s how we started with the music aspect. We just started hanging out more, and it became a lifestyle – more of a religion. We had started making plans and started evolving more of our homies/crew into what it is now.\n\n\"If people say New York hip hop is back, then New York hip hop is back. The people are the ones that create these terms...\"\n\n-- Oso Dope\n\nIs it more of a group or collective? Because it’s very specific wording. For example, Wu-Tang is a group. I guess they’ve grown into a collective, but they're a group. Do you guys think about yourselves as separate entities or do you work more as a group?\n\nKidaf: Nah, I think it’s like this bro: If we’re all in the same room, it’s a group. But the minute I step outside that door, it’s all me. We’re all in our shit, and we all have our style you know what I'm saying? That’s why the group is so strong. I think we’re kind of both, man. I think once you start to use words like the group and collective...I mean, we’re brothers; I'm probably going to chill with them later on today, and smoke—you know what I'm saying? We’re a family...we’re a family first.\n\nShine: It’s like collective creatively. The group is like the family. We mob together. \n\nOSO: Everyone has their shit, yeah.\n\nKidaf: Exactly, everyone has their creative niche that just coexists with everyone else. That’s the collective part of it. One vibration.\n\nIt’s an interesting direction too because if you think about it, collectives don’t break up. Groups break up. Groups always have trouble, but collectives don’t break up because it’s a different mentality. Native tongues is a collective; they're all very strong artists kind of on their own. \n\nWhat are you guys currently working on?\n\nWe just dropped a tape called Live from the Dungeon that can be found on DatPiff.\n\nOSO: We also dropped Camo Assassin like a week or two ago. That’s the shit that we just did; we were in the studio for 22 hours with Harry Freud, we came out with that. It came out through Red Bull Sound Selects. They (Red Bull) put us up on Pandora, too. We’re going to keep creating keep giving you guys a taste of Loaf, you know what I'm saying. Just more and more.\n\nKidaf: A lot of things, a lot of projects following up. That’s what people can expect. More Live From The Dungeon, more of that experience, more of that insight. \n\nHere’s a question: You guys do a lot independently. Do you guys think about maybe going with a label or going major? Do you think there’s an advantage?\n\nKidaf: Loaf Muzik, it’s a label already. That’s how we operate. Always had a do-it-yourself mentality. When we were all getting together, trying to figure out how we were going to get this shit bigger, it was never like, how are we going to get found? It was more like, how are we going to create a foundation of sand, that way we can keep getting bigger to fill more places? We don’t have a handout mentality. Not to say that anybody getting signed to a label is getting a handout, but in-house is our specialty, and we take a lot of pride in that. Getting shit done on our own, and not working for somebody but working with somebody.\n\nWho are some of the artists that you guys look up to?\n\nOSO: On the real, I look up to Daf.\n\nKidaf: Yeah, to keep it real with you bro, to keep it real, I listen to a lot of rap. Regarding artists I look up to, I look up to these guys bro. Not even be corny with it. I know these people. It’s hard for me to sit down and create a character for an artist that I look up to, and want to be like. Hip-hop is what we do; you know what I'm saying? I'm more inspired by the people around me, how they get down. The last thing you want to do is be the wack nigga while your homies are killing it. So yeah, that’s my answer to that bro.\n\nYou guys do have a very 90s sound. I'm much older than you guys. I'm about 10, 12 years older than you guys. You guys sound like the shit I was bumping in high school, which is dope. It’s very organic; it doesn’t seem like you're trying to sound like that.\n\nKidaf: People say shit like that all the time, bro. Ever since we started, people have been saying that. I don’t think that's what we’re going for; I think we’re just going for lyricism. That’s how it is in my head. Everybody else is filtered; it will go straight to old school hip hop. We spit, we do what we like, you know what I'm saying? Of course, to a lot of people, it’s going to translate into that. That’s just the way life is. \n\nOSO: I think it’s a compliment, having them compare us. Not compare us, but tell us that we remind them of something that is great. I feel like the music from the 90s is great music, it hits home. That’s the root of a lot of people’s hip hop introduction. To be able to remind people much older than us, it’s a compliment. Yo, I remind you of a great time? That’s what’s up! We remind you of great music? Thank you, it’s an honor.\n\nShine: Whenever people say that it’s a compliment. To me, music from the 90s is very much timeless. So when people say we remind them of that sound, It’s like saying we have a timeless sound. That’s very much what music should be; music should be timeless.\n\nPeople seem to be the most connected to a certain period of music in their lives, you know what I'm saying. It’s like in the Tribe song, was it Excursions? When Q-Tip’s dad was saying that hip hop reminded hI'm of bebop. That’s what he listened to when he was a kid. \n\nOSO: That shit was dope, bebop, it’s a compliment. I feel like every music has a  root, it comes from somewhere. I feel like the further you go back in music, the greater it makes you feel based on the vibrations. To remind someone of those good vibrations is a good feeling because that’s what we want to do. We want to transcend good vibrations and positivity when we do our art, do our lyricism, do our beats, do our visuals, do our shows, do all that. \n\n\"To me, music from the 90s is very much timeless. So when people say we remind them of that sound, It’s like saying we have a timeless sound.\"\n\n-- Shine Sinatra\n\nHow important is it for you guys to stay true to where you're from as New York cats? Because when I listen to you guys, it sounds like a resurgence of New York hip hop. It sounds like New York is coming back. Hip-hop went through many stages, and it went through damn near every region in the United States of America in the last 20 years. \n\nShine: If people say New York hip hop, is back then I guess they should say \"hip hop\" is back – and that’s dope. In a conventional sense, it’s back, but it never left. It’s in the streets. It’s a lifestyle, and you just don’t drop a lifestyle. As long as people who live that lifestyle are still breathing, then it’s still alive. \n\nI feel like maybe eight years ago you guys would’ve been as buzzing. The sound was very, very different.\n\nShine: People are always going just to try to put things in categories…\n\nKidaf: One style can make other styles obsolete if enough people fuck with it. Think about it. It’s like alright cool, somebody is rapping about diamonds, and mad niggas is fucking with diamonds. But then, some nigga comes out of nowhere from the gutter in the Bronx, or some shit, and says, \"we don’t give a fuck about nothing, and the niggas are on the fucking street.\" It'll be like, fuck diamonds bro, we’re hitting the streets, this shit is hot now. It’s not even about the style. It’s the wavelengths, bro, that changes over time because nothing stops moving including people. Niggas get older; new people take their place. New shit.\n\nOSO: If people say New York hip hop is back, then New York hip hop is back. The people are the ones that create these terms and like Daf said, these wavelengths. They're like the critics; they're the perspective. So it’s like, they receive what we create. So whatever they see is how they feel about it. That's technically how it goes, you know. \n\nWhere do you guys see Loaf Muzik going? What’s your ultimate goal? It might be a hard question. What’s your goal? What do you guys want to be 30 years from now when people are looking back? What do you want people to remember about Loaf Muzik?\n\nKidaf: Our creations – everything we expose as artists. We want to be remembered as what we do, what we create, what we put out. It's just crazy because we all have mad shit, mad goals, and when we come together, it just multiplies. I just want to Influence others, really, just to continue to vibrate on this frequency with us, to spread positivity.\n\nShine: Maybe some nigga that we don’t even know, from some other part of the world somewhere is going to get up and change his whole life just because he heard a track and got inspired. That is contagious.\n\nOSO: No more of that hating, people. It's about unity. It’s real; that’s what it comes down to. That’s where hip-hop started, people coming together. I feel like we have the platforms to make it happen, so that’s what wegoing to do.\n\nShine: Make some dope ass music, travel the world and shit.\n\nKidaf: Yeah, pretty much.\n\nYou guys have any last words, any last shout outs? \n\nOSO: Thanks for the interview man.\n\nKidaf: Shout out to AboveAverageHipHop.com, thanks for having us, yo. \n\nShine: You should check out Camo Assasins when you get the chance. \n\nKidaf: You know what I'm saying, high new hip hop! Shout out to my man, shout out to Captain Mark… mad dope visuals, new films, just stay in the fucking loop with us. Keep out, keep watch, Brooklyn, Queens, all that shit universal.",

I knew Shadow in middle school; he was living in Brooklyn. It was like a community thing. I was living all the way in Queens. I was fucking with his shit, he was fucking with mine, and then we linked up – and we started making music together. It sounds pretty straightforward, but it was dope the way everything came together.\n\nOSO: The simplest form of it was pretty much… I knew Shine from the neighborhood, and I also knew Shadow from the neighborhood. It was like \"I’m going to rep your shit, you're going to rep my shit,\" that’s how we started with the music aspect. We just started hanging out more, and it became a lifestyle – more of a religion. We had started making plans and started evolving more of our homies/crew into what it is now.\n\n\"If people say New York hip hop is back, then New York hip hop is back. The people are the ones that create these terms...\"\n\n-- Oso Dope\n\nIs it more of a group or collective? Because it’s very specific wording. For example, Wu-Tang is a group. I guess they’ve grown into a collective, but they're a group. Do you guys think about yourselves as separate entities or do you work more as a group?\n\nKidaf: Nah, I think it’s like this bro: If we’re all in the same room, it’s a group. But the minute I step outside that door, it’s all me. We’re all in our shit, and we all have our style you know what I'm saying? That’s why the group is so strong. I think we’re kind of both, man. I think once you start to use words like the group and collective...I mean, we’re brothers; I'm probably going to chill with them later on today, and smoke—you know what I'm saying? We’re a family...we’re a family first.\n\nShine: It’s like collective creatively. The group is like the family. We mob together. \n\nOSO: Everyone has their shit, yeah.\n\nKidaf: Exactly, everyone has their creative niche that just coexists with everyone else. That’s the collective part of it. One vibration.\n\nIt’s an interesting direction too because if you think about it, collectives don’t break up. Groups break up. Groups always have trouble, but collectives don’t break up because it’s a different mentality. Native tongues is a collective; they're all very strong artists kind of on their own. \n\nWhat are you guys currently working on?\n\nWe just dropped a tape called Live from the Dungeon that can be found on DatPiff.\n\nOSO: We also dropped Camo Assassin like a week or two ago. That’s the shit that we just did; we were in the studio for 22 hours with Harry Freud, we came out with that. It came out through Red Bull Sound Selects. They (Red Bull) put us up on Pandora, too. We’re going to keep creating keep giving you guys a taste of Loaf, you know what I'm saying. Just more and more.\n\nKidaf: A lot of things, a lot of projects following up. That’s what people can expect. More Live From The Dungeon, more of that experience, more of that insight. \n\nHere’s a question: You guys do a lot independently. Do you guys think about maybe going with a label or going major? Do you think there’s an advantage?\n\nKidaf: Loaf Muzik, it’s a label already. That’s how we operate. Always had a do-it-yourself mentality. When we were all getting together, trying to figure out how we were going to get this shit bigger, it was never like, how are we going to get found? It was more like, how are we going to create a foundation of sand, that way we can keep getting bigger to fill more places? We don’t have a handout mentality. Not to say that anybody getting signed to a label is getting a handout, but in-house is our specialty, and we take a lot of pride in that. Getting shit done on our own, and not working for somebody but working with somebody.\n\nWho are some of the artists that you guys look up to?\n\nOSO: On the real, I look up to Daf.\n\nKidaf: Yeah, to keep it real with you bro, to keep it real, I listen to a lot of rap. Regarding artists I look up to, I look up to these guys bro. Not even be corny with it. I know these people. It’s hard for me to sit down and create a character for an artist that I look up to, and want to be like. Hip-hop is what we do; you know what I'm saying? I'm more inspired by the people around me, how they get down. The last thing you want to do is be the wack nigga while your homies are killing it. So yeah, that’s my answer to that bro.\n\nYou guys do have a very 90s sound. I'm much older than you guys. I'm about 10, 12 years older than you guys. You guys sound like the shit I was bumping in high school, which is dope. It’s very organic; it doesn’t seem like you're trying to sound like that.\n\nKidaf: People say shit like that all the time, bro. Ever since we started, people have been saying that. I don’t think that's what we’re going for; I think we’re just going for lyricism. That’s how it is in my head. Everybody else is filtered; it will go straight to old school hip hop. We spit, we do what we like, you know what I'm saying? Of course, to a lot of people, it’s going to translate into that. That’s just the way life is. \n\nOSO: I think it’s a compliment, having them compare us. Not compare us, but tell us that we remind them of something that is great. I feel like the music from the 90s is great music, it hits home. That’s the root of a lot of people’s hip hop introduction. To be able to remind people much older than us, it’s a compliment. Yo, I remind you of a great time? That’s what’s up! We remind you of great music? Thank you, it’s an honor.\n\nShine: Whenever people say that it’s a compliment. To me, music from the 90s is very much timeless. So when people say we remind them of that sound, It’s like saying we have a timeless sound. That’s very much what music should be; music should be timeless.\n\nPeople seem to be the most connected to a certain period of music in their lives, you know what I'm saying. It’s like in the Tribe song, was it Excursions? When Q-Tip’s dad was saying that hip hop reminded hI'm of bebop. That’s what he listened to when he was a kid. \n\nOSO: That shit was dope, bebop, it’s a compliment. I feel like every music has a  root, it comes from somewhere. I feel like the further you go back in music, the greater it makes you feel based on the vibrations. To remind someone of those good vibrations is a good feeling because that’s what we want to do. We want to transcend good vibrations and positivity when we do our art, do our lyricism, do our beats, do our visuals, do our shows, do all that. \n\n\"To me, music from the 90s is very much timeless. So when people say we remind them of that sound, It’s like saying we have a timeless sound.\"\n\n-- Shine Sinatra\n\nHow important is it for you guys to stay true to where you're from as New York cats? Because when I listen to you guys, it sounds like a resurgence of New York hip hop. It sounds like New York is coming back. Hip-hop went through many stages, and it went through damn near every region in the United States of America in the last 20 years. \n\nShine: If people say New York hip hop, is back then I guess they should say \"hip hop\" is back – and that’s dope. In a conventional sense, it’s back, but it never left. It’s in the streets. It’s a lifestyle, and you just don’t drop a lifestyle. As long as people who live that lifestyle are still breathing, then it’s still alive. \n\nI feel like maybe eight years ago you guys would’ve been as buzzing. The sound was very, very different.\n\nShine: People are always going just to try to put things in categories…\n\nKidaf: One style can make other styles obsolete if enough people fuck with it. Think about it. It’s like alright cool, somebody is rapping about diamonds, and mad niggas is fucking with diamonds. But then, some nigga comes out of nowhere from the gutter in the Bronx, or some shit, and says, \"we don’t give a fuck about nothing, and the niggas are on the fucking street.\" It'll be like, fuck diamonds bro, we’re hitting the streets, this shit is hot now. It’s not even about the style. It’s the wavelengths, bro, that changes over time because nothing stops moving including people. Niggas get older; new people take their place. New shit.\n\nOSO: If people say New York hip hop is back, then New York hip hop is back. The people are the ones that create these terms and like Daf said, these wavelengths. They're like the critics; they're the perspective. So it’s like, they receive what we create. So whatever they see is how they feel about it. That's technically how it goes, you know. \n\nWhere do you guys see Loaf Muzik going? What’s your ultimate goal? It might be a hard question. What’s your goal? What do you guys want to be 30 years from now when people are looking back? What do you want people to remember about Loaf Muzik?\n\nKidaf: Our creations – everything we expose as artists. We want to be remembered as what we do, what we create, what we put out. It's just crazy because we all have mad shit, mad goals, and when we come together, it just multiplies. I just want to Influence others, really, just to continue to vibrate on this frequency with us, to spread positivity.\n\nShine: Maybe some nigga that we don’t even know, from some other part of the world somewhere is going to get up and change his whole life just because he heard a track and got inspired. That is contagious.\n\nOSO: No more of that hating, people. It's about unity. It’s real; that’s what it comes down to. That’s where hip-hop started, people coming together. I feel like we have the platforms to make it happen, so that’s what wegoing to do.\n\nShine: Make some dope ass music, travel the world and shit.\n\nKidaf: Yeah, pretty much.\n\nYou guys have any last words, any last shout outs? \n\nOSO: Thanks for the interview man.\n\nKidaf: Shout out to AboveAverageHipHop.com, thanks for having us, yo. \n\nShine: You should check out Camo Assasins when you get the chance. \n\nKidaf: You know what I'm saying, high new hip hop! Shout out to my man, shout out to Captain Mark… mad dope visuals, new films, just stay in the fucking loop with us. Keep out, keep watch, Brooklyn, Queens, all that shit universal.",

    "content": "I was gifted with a voice, but I have a rapper mentality.\n--TI'm Vocals\n\nThere has always been a fair share of R&B \"bad boys,\" for lack of a better term. By that, I mean singers who, well, have more of an edge to them than other singers. I'm not talking about Chris Brown-esque antics either, I'm talking singers like Aaron Hall for example, or (probably a better example) The late Nate Dogg, who crooned about the ghetto lifestyle, and had an unmistakable aura of authenticity that made hI'm a star (even if he did lack actual battle scars). I recently came across a new singer by the name of TI'm Vocals when perusing WorldStar, and was an instant fan. Over the infamous White Iverson instrumental, TI'm initially came off – content wise – like Uncle Murda, mixed with a more soulful/hungry Usher. Dope right?\n\nI explored his catalogue of music, including his Live From Harlem mixtape, and found more than a handful of gems, like the bassy drug dealer anthem, Harlem NYC, and numerous \"goon remixes,\" like his recent take on Weeknd's The Hills, titled The Pills. TI'm came up on the mean streets of Harlem, and went through his share of real-life experiences, spending some years in and out of jail before putting the streets into the rear view, and hitting the ground running in the industry. You can hear this authenticity in his music, which adds to his brand and makes his voice so relatable throughout neighbourhoods nationwide. To fully understand what I mean, just watch some of his early vids where he's singing in building lobby's back on the block; he lived that life.\n\nHis team is solid, and he's working with the likes of Harry Fraud, Nino Man, Smoke DZA and more, so evidently TI'm is on a serious come-up – and someone you should keep an eye/ear on. TI'm was kind enough to hop on a call with me to chat about his new album, R.N.B, which is available now, and more. Check the Q&A below. Be sure to grab Tim's R.N.B album on I-Tunes ASAP – or stream it on Spotify.\n\nHow did you get into music?\n\nOh man, that’s a good question. I got into music listening to my older sisters and brothers play music in the house all the time – and certain things stuck more than others. I was always into rap but when I heard R&B, it became something I had to get into. So I got my first tape player and headphones, and then I just started emulating what I heard. Bam, here I am today.\n\nHow big of an influence is hip-hop on your R&B? Because you’re R&B but its more street…\n\nYeah, I was gifted with a voice, but I have a rapper mentality. I think what’s influenced me as far as R&B, are singers like Jodeci, Chris Brown, Usher, Donell Jones, but the rap -- I grew up listening to LL. Going back to the old school, Kool G Rap, Big Daddy Kane; I listened to a whole lot of rap music to hear what’s going on. That’s how I fell in love with rap and music period. But, I don’t think I have a genre. I don’t think that anything that I’m doing right now has a set stage. I just love music right now. I’m making music that makes me feel good. As far as my R.N.B album, I was going through things in my life at the time – and I just wrote about it. That’s basically what it is right now. I’m loving music again.\n\nTell me a little bit about your current project, who you are working with and the process of putting it together.\n\nI’m working with a label called Next; it’s an independent label. The Orchard is pushing it out – I’m pretty sure everybody knows what Orchard is. My feature artists, well, there’s a couple of people, like Smoke DZA, my son Dash… I’ve worked with a lot of people to get here. It was a smooth process. I’ve got another project in mind that is going to be real heavy; I just wanted to get this out there and get my feet wet.\n\nAlright, so who are some people that you’d like to work with in the industry?\n\nNumber one would be like Drake, Miguel -- I’d like to work with Bryson Tiller right now, too. I’d like to work with a lot of people.\n\nHow important is authenticity in your music?\n\nI think that the more I see, the more I feel, and the more I write while things are fresh – at the time – the better the music (depending on what mode I’m in). If I’m in a deep mode at the time, I can write about anything. But, those feelings at the time, that energy, that's what I’m going to give off. If I’m around good vibes, the music is going to show it. If I’m around bad things, it’s going to reflect too.\n\nWhat are you currently working on right now?\n\nI’ve got something in the works with Harry Fraud; we’re doing a little EP you know what I’m saying? That wasn’t supposed to be told, but I said it anyway -- you know me. I also have another album I’m working on – but that one is something I’m going to do with other people. I’ve got a couple of things you know what I’m saying?\n\nSo, you write for other people as well?\n\nYes, I do. But the other people I write for are underground artists.\n\nDo you find that to be a therapeutic process? Are they all similar artists to you?\n\nYou know, I go into it unbiased to everything. I just write. I think of it as a therapeutic process at the same time, but I just love music from the beat, to the writing, to the actual singing – and references or whatever it is. I love it.\n\nDo you have any new visuals coming up?\n\nYes, I have a video coming out; the third single off my album called Things You Do For Love. That’s going to be pretty dope.\n\nThat Black Washington joint was the catchiest shit ever. You need to know that!\n\nI appreciate that. I don’t even pay attention to stuff like that when I’m around friends. I’ll just be listening to everybody else. I don’t even listen to myself much. I listen to everybody else.\n\nYeah, it’s weird; some people are the complete opposite. I talk to some artists that say, “I only listen to my music,” like Wayne. I think it was in an interview someone asked hI'm what he thought of the new Nicki album (when Nicki and Drake first dropped their albums), and he admitted that he didn’t listen to the album all the way through. He’d ever heard them because he only listens to his own shit 24/7.\n\nThat’s dope for him. It’s crazy for a Libra because I’m a Libra too, we usually show the love. But I don’t know. I’m always listening to somebody else. I like to hear new sounds and new people with their ideas and how they want to express it through music. I’m always for that.\n\nDo you have any other artists in your crew that you’re working with? Is it just you as TI'm Vocals or is there a team we should be looking out for?\n\nI got a team in mind, but I don’t think I’m going to present them just yet because everything is in the works. But, I’ve got a person I’ve been working with. We’re about to go back and do what we’ve got to do. We’re about to make that shit happen again.\n\nTim, do you have any last words or anything else you’d like to leave our blog with?\n\nYo, just be on the look out for some fire, man. I appreciate anybody and any blogger or anybody that wants to interview me. I think that what I’ve got to say is very important. Yeah, as he said, honestly, I appreciate everybody that wants to know my story and what’s going on with me.",

    "title": "Winning Is Necessary: an interview with NZ export Winston Antony",
    "content": "No matter what it is you decide to do you have two options; give it 0% or give it 100% – there is no in between.\n–Winston Anthony\n\nIt never ceases to amaze me how connected the world has become, and how worldwide hip-hop truly is. An example was last week, when I came across an up and coming rapper named Winston Anthony, who submitted his latest video All Night via our submission page. It wasn't until I explored his bio that I realized that Winston was from New Zealand – of all places. In fact, our peers over at undergroundhiohopblog.com have dubbed hI'm on of the most prominent artists from the country. That co-sign alone told me that I was missing out on something; a problem I quickly corrected.\n\nWinston has a great visual presentation, a good catalogue of tunes, and more than enough plays – and buzz – to pique the interest of the average hype beast. We wanted to learn a little more about him, so we reached out for a Q&A to get more familiar with his process, his goals and his upcoming projects.\n\nHow did you get into hip-hop?\n\nI got in to Hip-Hop when I was about 16, I met this kid I was in high school with who was in a rap group with his little brother and another one of our homies. He asked me to join and back then I was way too timid so I offered to make beats and write hooks. I never turned back after that.\n\nWho were some of your influences?\n\nI low key hate this question [laughs]; but only because I was raised on R&B as opposed to Hip-Hop. So, my answer is never the regular Pac, Biggie, Nas etc. I mean, don't get me wrong, I do love the greats and always pay my respects. But my personal influences were more along the lines of Michael Jackson, Jay-Z, Kanye West, Timberland, T.I. & Eminem.\n\nBeing from New Zealand must give you a must different perspective on today's music industry. Maybe talk about the scene out there.\n\nYeah, I mean the scene from New Zealand is a special scene I think. It's a country where people aren't afraid to try things you know? It's been interesting for someone like myself though who was raised on quite an American style of music to watch the New Zealand sound grow and evolve organically and, of course, being a part of the industry watching artists who I know define that sound. I would say if you wanted to ever really listen to some Hip-Hop that emulated New Zealand's sound, look up these three names to give you a broad view of where the country is at: Home Brew Crew, Raiza Biza & Diaz Grimm.\n\nTalk about Side Chick, and some of the response you received internationally.\n\nSide Chick was an interesting project to work on. I wanted to do something that other rappers hadn't done but also I love concept projects, so it needed that aspect. Then I came up with the idea of doing a project predominantly for women with the twist that it was actually about a bunch of side chicks. To be honest, it did better than I was expecting it to do, I was blessed enough to have the support of my fam out in L.A. (undergroundhiphopblog.com) with the drop and it sort of just grew from there. ixDaily from Canada jumped on board, AyeBro from New Zealand showed love, OZHipHop from out here in Australia supported, and it even made a best of 2015 list on Audiocamp. Admittedly it was a project where I let people know that I grew up on R&B. Like, I wasn't trying to be hard, gangster or anything I'm not really and I think that's why people took to it. At least for my fan base, it was something you could relate to. My female fan base related to it the most. I mean, I guess this is the generation of side chicks and side n***as.\n\nWhat are you currently working on?\n\nI am currently working on the follow-up project to Side Chick. But this one is called Main Chick, I don't really want to say too much about it at this stage other than that it sounds stupid good and that I'm going to need everyone to be patient with this one, because I have a couple of things planned for it which I hope can be mad game changers, at least for myself – and anyone else in my lane.

You know what to do, and you're ready to play, but you're just waiting to figure out how you fit in the team.\" Admittedly I still have a lot to learn, as we all do. But I do believe he was predominantly right. At this point, if my team and I can keep doing what we do, its only a matter of time.\n\nAre you looking for a deal, or are you going to do it independently?\n\nAt this point I am focused on doing it independently. I was never raised to wait on anything or expect hand outs and one thing I learn't, while I was in L.A. was that there are a million artists out there. Labels don't really care who you are unless they can see you putting in work. So focusing on the independent grind seems like the only logical move you know?\n\nWhat do you want people to take away from you as an artist?\n\nWinning is Necessary. No matter what it is you decide to do you have two options; give it 0% or give it 100% there is no in between. That's something that one of my mentors taught me a few years back and since then, my team and I have gone on to do a list of things that we were never supposed to be able to do. Other than that, don't fit societies mold.

    "clean_content": "No matter what it is you decide to do you have two options; give it 0% or give it 100% – there is no in between.\n–Winston Anthony\n\nIt never ceases to amaze me how connected the world has become, and how worldwide hip-hop truly is. An example was last week, when I came across an up and coming rapper named Winston Anthony, who submitted his latest video All Night via our submission page. It wasn't until I explored his bio that I realized that Winston was from New Zealand – of all places. In fact, our peers over at undergroundhiohopblog.com have dubbed hI'm on of the most prominent artists from the country. That co-sign alone told me that I was missing out on something; a problem I quickly corrected.\n\nWinston has a great visual presentation, a good catalogue of tunes, and more than enough plays – and buzz – to pique the interest of the average hype beast. We wanted to learn a little more about him, so we reached out for a Q&A to get more familiar with his process, his goals and his upcoming projects.\n\nHow did you get into hip-hop?\n\nI got in to Hip-Hop when I was about 16, I met this kid I was in high school with who was in a rap group with his little brother and another one of our homies. He asked me to join and back then I was way too timid so I offered to make beats and write hooks. I never turned back after that.\n\nWho were some of your influences?\n\nI low key hate this question [laughs]; but only because I was raised on R&B as opposed to Hip-Hop. So, my answer is never the regular Pac, Biggie, Nas etc. I mean, don't get me wrong, I do love the greats and always pay my respects. But my personal influences were more along the lines of Michael Jackson, Jay-Z, Kanye West, Timberland, T.I. & Eminem.\n\nBeing from New Zealand must give you a must different perspective on today's music industry. Maybe talk about the scene out there.\n\nYeah, I mean the scene from New Zealand is a special scene I think. It's a country where people aren't afraid to try things you know? It's been interesting for someone like myself though who was raised on quite an American style of music to watch the New Zealand sound grow and evolve organically and, of course, being a part of the industry watching artists who I know define that sound. I would say if you wanted to ever really listen to some Hip-Hop that emulated New Zealand's sound, look up these three names to give you a broad view of where the country is at: Home Brew Crew, Raiza Biza & Diaz Grimm.\n\nTalk about Side Chick, and some of the response you received internationally.\n\nSide Chick was an interesting project to work on. I wanted to do something that other rappers hadn't done but also I love concept projects, so it needed that aspect. Then I came up with the idea of doing a project predominantly for women with the twist that it was actually about a bunch of side chicks. To be honest, it did better than I was expecting it to do, I was blessed enough to have the support of my fam out in L.A. (undergroundhiphopblog.com) with the drop and it sort of just grew from there. ixDaily from Canada jumped on board, AyeBro from New Zealand showed love, OZHipHop from out here in Australia supported, and it even made a best of 2015 list on Audiocamp. Admittedly it was a project where I let people know that I grew up on R&B. Like, I wasn't trying to be hard, gangster or anything I'm not really and I think that's why people took to it. At least for my fan base, it was something you could relate to. My female fan base related to it the most. I mean, I guess this is the generation of side chicks and side n***as.\n\nWhat are you currently working on?\n\nI am currently working on the follow-up project to Side Chick. But this one is called Main Chick, I don't really want to say too much about it at this stage other than that it sounds stupid good and that I'm going to need everyone to be patient with this one, because I have a couple of things planned for it which I hope can be mad game changers, at least for myself – and anyone else in my lane.

The region's mixture of realities that range from carefree beachfront living, plastic Hollywood dreaming, and circles of gang violence, LA has given us a broad variety of artists from all genres and mediums. Just Matthew is one such artist to emerge from the golden glow of Cali. At just 24 years of age, this rapper, singer and songwriter has developed a strong, confident style and sound that has hI'm primed to take things to the next level.\n\nJust Matthew's latest project, the four-song EP Connery, is an excellent example of his range and capabilities as an artist. The lead song, Forget, has a laid back summery vibe that matches the Cali weather. With an almost Drake-esque (in a good way) flow, he bobs and weaves from singing to rapping, delivering a radio-ready performance that leaves a great first impression. Prototype sees hI'm dig deeper beneath the surface as he embraces imperfections, and lets listeners know that he is indeed a work in progress – and his hunger to grow is the raw element that fuels his sound. Understand It, and Bonnie, both have Matthew showing off his flow, which sparkles throughout the EP. Produced entirely by MKSB, the project sounds cohesive sonically, while still managing to deliver four songs that allow Matthew to show four different sides of himself.\n\nJust Matthew's music is very current, catchy honest and personal. He's an artist to keep your eyes and ears on this year. Listen to his four-track EP below.",

After the success of his debut mixtape, The Instrumental Assassin – hosted by DJ WhiteOwl – Phoenix moved to Phoenix, AZ, to work on his EP'Valley of The Sun' produced by Pezey Krack. During 2015 Phoenix produced, wrote, & starred as the main character in his very own short film Valley of The Sun, which sold out at Harkins Theatre (Arizona Mills) & also had huge success debuting in his hometown December 10th. December 19th Phoenix released his latest mixtape Indigo: A New Generation, a strong ten-song project that explores everything from police brutality, injustice, lost love and all the real-life stuff that falls in between. It's a wonderful introduction for first-time listeners – and a welcome addition to his catalogue for long-time supports.\n\nFrom the start of the album, Phoenix establishes the tone with a collection of sound it's from news broadcasts recounting the deaths of iconic artists such as 2Pac, Biggie, Aaliyah, and Jimmi Hendrix. He also includes a collection of news clips discussing the deaths of black youth across the United States. It's this off the top way he's aligning himself with legends that some may find egotistical – something he discusses on Nodus Tollens, which shows off his laid-back flow. Highlights of this album include the Child (All I Ever Wanted), which discusses the concept of an inferiority complex, S.A.M, a letter to women who cheated on him, and Wabi-Sabi, which received a sexy video treatment.\n\nThe project also includes features from Young Money rapper Cory Gunz, on the remix to the song VGV – the second last song on the album. He claims his ultimate dream is to sign to J. Cole's Dreamville label or RocNation. With a project like Indigo, Phoenix shows promise. He's an artist to keep locked on, as it's only a matter of time! His film Valley of The Sun will be available this spring, but in the meantime, check out the official trailer.",

    "content": "\"Can’t buy backbone, no wholesale.”\n\n– Jay Ax\n\nOriginally from Brooklyn, and currently residing in Staten Island, rapper Jay Ax is a magnetic emcee that exudes confidence – and has the skills to back it up. Over the years, Jay Ax has developed a deep music catalog comprised of 5 mixtapes, which have sold over 12,000 copies. Not that many artists these days can claI'm that. He's also shared stages with industry royalty like T-Pain, Wyclef Jean, Khia, Keith Murray, Jae Millz and others. His latest offering is a twenty song banger of a project entitled Don’t Ax Don’t Tell. It’s a solid offering that has three distinct vibes – trap/street, radio, and soulful. Over the course of the project, which may seem a bit daunting at first based on the length, Jay rides and excels the current trends and sounds that dominate the New York scene, but also gives brief glimpses into his character and personality. Please keep in mind, I'm approaching this project as a first-time listener.\n\nSongs like the radio friendly Match My Fly, featuring Brodie Jaymz and Bianca Bonnie, and Bank On Fleek show off Jay’s commercial appeal, and ability to craft joints that are timely and relevant to the current market; however, his more shining moments appear when he steps out of his lane slightly. The album’s opener Commencement, for example, is a slow, soulful production that features his nephew, Fortune. This flow/vibe – and even subject matter – doesn’t pop up again until later in the project. He gets more personal, and delves below the surface, on tracks like Barz, and the ultra hype Giant. On the later he drops lines like: “rebel born a pebble, now I wanna be a boulder.”\n\nMust-listens have to be the album closer, Curtain Call, which is a letter to a fallen comrade, and the anthemic New York Gritty, featuring the Brooklyn bully – and former Roc Nation soldier – Uncle Murda. As well, Jay speaks on discriminatory law practices, and the overall degradation of the relationships between police and citizens in urban areas on the songs They and These Laws Ain’t Right.\n\nJay Ax's music has a sonic confidence that comes along with both longevity and dedication. Based on his past sales, and the plays on his various profiles, his fans are eating it up. Rightfully so; this time around, he’s cooked up a hardy (long play) feast for your rides and music playing devices. Jay Ax displays – on wax – why he was considered among the best male performers at the Underground Music Awards in NYC in 2014, and why he’s ready to take his career to the next level.",

    "content": "\"If ppl are gonna just pray for the 90's sound to come back (which I respect), shit is gonna be the same forever...\"\n\n– Gavlyn (via Facebook)\n\n26-year-old LA-based rapper Gavlyn has it factor that's so prevalent it's impossible to ignore. She's been on my radar since she dropped From The Art four year ago, and she has yet to disappoint. Debuting around the same time that Kreayshawn and her White Girl Mob were rising to notoriety, Gav went left, and set herself apart as an artist by building her sound around a 90's hip-hop aesthetic, which went over well – as you imagine.\n\nHer confident, (sort of) deep, distinctive voice – and actual bars – have earned her a massive following, and millions of YouTube spins. She's dropped four albums and has rocked six international tours, gracing stages with royalty in the game, like Wu-Tang Clan for example; all this before the age of 26. With her latest album, Make Up For Your Break Up available for purchase worldwide, her upcoming European tour with her homegirl Reverie this April, and her imprint – Peach House – in effect, she shows no signs of slowing down her momentum.\n\nShe was kind enough to take some time out to do a quick Q&A for AAHIPHOP – see below. Be sure to cop Make Up For Your Break Up today!\n\nHow did you get involved in hip-hop (originally)?\n\nThe way I got involved with hip-hop originally was – obviously – being a fan of it, and growing up listening to it. I was also around cyphers as a kid and just hopped in jokingly and feel in love with it\n\nYou truly do seem like an \"old soul\" – can you explain how you initially gravitated toward your sound?\n\nI have a lot of siblings that put me onto old school hip hop, and parents that introduced me to old school music in general. Not to mention, I always used to steal their CDs as a kid.\n\nWho were some of your influences as you were starting out?\n\nMy influences starting out were Jean Grae, Typical Cats, Little Brother, 9th Wonder, Guru, Dj Quick, Sugarfree, Snoop Dogg, and Helta Skelta.\n\nThere is so much growth from your first two albums to Modest Confidence. It seemed as though you/it had a different vibe (sonically). Was that something that was intentional, or was it more organic?\n\nMy growth was a little bit of both. It was intentional to show people the new direction that I was trying to go, but it was also organic trying to show people where my mind was at the time and what I was going through in my life.\n\nTell me about Make Up For Your Break Up – what was the concept behind the album? Was it the product of a break-up?\n\nThe meaning behind the album is whenever women go through things in life, such as a break-up, bad fight, or struggles in general, she tends to wear more makeup to cover up her emotions and how she feels.\n\nWhat advantages do you see staying independent? Have you had any interest from majors thus far?\n\nOne of the biggest advantages of being independent is being able to be your own creative director. I have had interest from majors, but none that have sold me yet.\n\nYou’re so young, but you have such an impressive catalogue thus far…what’s next for Gavlyn? What are your career goals?\n\nWhat's next for me is to define my lane and to be a voice for the young people in my generation because they haven't had the pleasures that 90's kids like myself have had to learn from the OG's of my time. I want to be able to teach kids what real music is, as opposed to all the watered down stuff that's out right now that they are unfortunately learning from.\n\nWhat projects do you have in the works for 2016?\n\nI'm working on a project right now with DJ Hoppa called'Why Wait', which is basically about not waiting to make things happen for yourself.:) Other than that, I have a European tour in April 2016 with Reverie. Lastly, some tours in the States that will be coming up. So stay tuned for that!\n\nAlso, she was on GGN – no big deal.",

    "content": "Today, the weather was unusually warm for winter; the sun came out this afternoon, as the city (of Toronto) hit a high of 50. So, as I hit the street to make the most of this anomaly, I decided to give the homie Neb Doe a spin. The West LA native's latest EP, \"3-2-1,\" is the perfect blend of bassy low tempo goodness. With influences that span from Wu-Tang Clan, Nas and Eminem, to Gorillaz, Kid Cudi and Mos Def, his approach to hip-hop is sonically innovative, without being so out of the box that he loses ears. This project does an excellent job of speaking to what's in while hinting at what's next.\n\nIt kicks off with the soulful jazz saxophone driven \"Intro (Symphony 35),\" where Neb's love of film bubbles to the surface amidst film stock and camera angle references. The sampled singer and echoey snaps on \"They Know\" create an atmospheric sound bed where Neb comes through with introspective – yet yolo-ish – live for the moment raps. The piano-driven \"Oh My!,\" and the Sister Sister sampled hook of \"Go Home Roger,\" show off Neb's ear for production. I was pleasantly surprised when I learned that all the beats were by entirely different producers, as they all have a cohesive feel.\n\n\"3-2-1\" has a cinematic feel to it, making it ideal soundtrack music for your movements. Neb is a wonderful example of the diversity the LA scene currently has to offer, especially with the Compton vibe dominating the airwaves. This is perfect music to bump as the sun begins to hide in the horizon, and you're rolling through the city with your windows down. Take an ear, and keep your eyes on Neb Doe!\n\nWest up!",

    "title": "Egypt Taylor x Kanye West - Champion",
    "content": "\"We on to the next one, on to better things and better dreams that's in my temple, I write em' with my pencil.”\n\n– Egypt Taylor\n\nPhiladelphia has a long and prestigious history in hip-hop. One of our contributors once began to break it down, but a timeline that starts with names like Schooly D and Fresh Prince, and leads to names like Beanie Siegel and Meek Mill, the city has long emblazoned its unique mark on hip-hop culture. But it’s a new day, and new voices are emerging. Once of these new voices is Egypt Taylor – a member of The Prodigies collective. Currently, on tour with the collective, Egypt has been busy prepping a new EP, but – alongside the release of Kanye’s Waves album – is dropping a new song titled Champion, produced by Kanye West himself.\n\nNeedless to say, having a song produced by Kanye West is a great look for such a new artist; actually, that's an understatement. A Kanye West beat in 2016 is something most artists will never achieve! We wanted to learn more about the song, so we linked up with Egypt for a quick Q&A. Check that out below, and take an ear to Champion, produced by Kanye.\n\n[wonderplugin_audio id=\"3\"]\n\nHow did you get into hip-hop?\n\nI got into hip-hop growing up around my cousin Kravitz, who was a producer at the time. He would make beats on his AKAI pad, and I would try to make my poems flow over his beats.\n\nWho are/were some of your influences?\n\nMy main influences would have to be MF DOOM, Jay-Z, Kool & The Gang, and, of course, Kanye.\n\nCan you describe your sound?\n\nI don’t have a particular sound that I consistently aI'm for when writing a song. The sound I hope to deliver varies from project to project and usually depends on how I'm feeling on that particular day. But I usually get that I have an old-school hip-hop sound in a lot of my tracks.\n\nTell me about your new track champion? How did the song come together?\n\nChampion is a crazy song. It’s different from my other projects, mainly because of the production. Kanye’s influence and work ethic makes the song stand out, which is great because it allowed me to write from a different creative perspective.\n\nHave you been sitting on this track for a while?\n\nYea, we were sitting on this track for a couple of months. The sound didn't fit the tone of my upcoming EP or anything I had planned on releasing soon, so we decided it was best to release it as a single along with the upcoming release of “Waves.”\n\nWith the release of waves, this is pretty great timing on your part. Besides Ye What other artists are you currently working with?\n\nYea, the timing is bittersweet. Kanye is a great producer and artist and has established himself as such. Having the exposure from a music legend is helpful for an upcoming artist, but it can also overshadow your work as a relatively underground artist. I am currently working on a track with Lil 100 from SODMG and a project with my collective member APEX Predator.\n\nWhat should we be looking out for?\n\nYou should most certainly be bracing yourself for APEX Predator’s self-titled, debut EP dropping on Feb. 15. As well as a few tracks featuring me and Kurt from Good Money Empire.\n\nDo you have an LP on the horizon?\n\nNo. There is a debut EP on the horizon though with some crazy features. Look out for that around late spring/early summer.\n\nWhat can you tell us about the prodigies?\n\nThe Prodigies is hip-hop collective and the title of the collective’s debut EP. Collective members APEX Predator and Vaniah, are the main artists featured on the EP. It was released to give listeners a glance at the different vibes and sounds the collective hopes to deliver on their individual projects.\n\nHow has the tour been thus far?\n\nThe tour has been amazing. As an upcoming artist, it is always great to get that initial support from your fans and listeners. Seeing people rock with you to your art at a live performance is motivating and encouraging.\n\nWhat has been your favorite show thus far?\n\nThe Philadelphia hip-hop scene as a whole has been my personal favorite place to perform. From the El to the venues, to Love Park, Philadelphians have always shown support, and that’s mad dope being a non-native to Philly.\n\nAre you guys working on more projects like this?\n\nYea, we hope to release more projects like this from other members of the collective to bring together the various sounds of different members on one whole project.\n\nWhat are your goals in the music industry?\n\nMy goals as an artist are to continue to inspire others to create long lasting, and call-to-action music. Music is an excellent form of communication because it reaches the general public daily. Aside from writing about wildlife experiences, I hope to create meaningful songs that inspire others to do good and bring unity to humanity.\n\nWhat is one thing you'd like your listeners to know about you as an artist?\n\nI want my listeners to know that I am human, and I have emotions. They change daily and sometimes hourly. Those emotions and feelings can be heard and felt in my projects and may seem to produce an inconsistency. But I am always the same person despite the sound of my music.\n\nDo you have any last words for our readers?\n\nIf you can think it, you can do it. Follow me on Twitter.",

Although you'd think that Internet technology would have made such a task incredibly easy, until late, it was quite cumbersome and expensive – almost unattainable by either those without a serious budget or above average computer skills.

New service, ScatterRadio, is allowing artists and wanna-be shock jocks the ability to start their free streaming radio station, and stream 24/7 via the web, or the ScatterRadio app. As an artist you can stream your entire catalogue, as a company/brand, you could stream commercials or infomercials. As a connoisseur with an awesome collection of music, you can simply play curator and share your playlist with the community.\n\nScatterRadio is more than just a radio playing application, though, as it allows users to chat and discuss the topics and music being played on the various channels. This could be an incredibly important feature and engagement measure for artists/labels looking for feedback on new/unsigned acts, or brands looking for feedback on products or services they're offering. It truly is a platform for the people, by the people.\n\nIf you're an unsigned artist who doesn't have the time to put into creating your station, or you simply just want to get your name out there, ScatterRadio is also offering to play unsigned artists on their new/trending music channels. That means you can send your music to ScatterRadio, as they curate channels specifically for new music the ranges from rock to hip-hop and rap.\n\nSo give ScatterRadio a try; if not to start your channel at first, at least, to take a listen to what other users are currently doing on the platform.",

    "content": "A lot of our readers have always wanted to know what the music business is actually like behind the scenes. We got a chance to catch up with Boozshi Music executive Shawn Campbell and get some good advice. Shawn is a Grammy-nominated producer and songwriter who has worked with musical heavy hitters like Missy Elliott, Jay-Z, Chris Brown, Foxy Brown and others; so, he knows what he's talking about!\n\nThanks for spending a little time with us!\n\nNo Worries!\n\nSo pull back the veil a little bit for us. What is the music business like?\n\nMan (shaking head) it is not for the faint of heart, that’s for sure. But I love it. It’s exhilarating. It is the kindof business where everything is oversized. When you win, you do so in spectacular fashion. When you fail, you do so in spectacular fashion.”\n\nWhat would you say is the most consistent quality or an artist to have to make it?\n\nThere are 2 qualities to have that can help you thrive where others don’t. My experience is that the truly successful people in this business have a high tolerance for rejection. They are also great sales people. Notice I didn’t mention talent in that list.\n\nWe did. Why is that?\n\nTalent is obviously a big deal but most artist suffer under the delusion that once talent is demonstrated, that labels will come looking for them. The truth is that labels reject the most mind blowingly talented artist every day. Then they turn around and sign lesser talented artist. Why? Because the lesser talented artist is a better salesman and sold his music to the public in a convincing manner.\n\nIs that how you were able to get so many artists signed?\n\nYes. I have pitched acts to everyone from Justin Timberlake to LA Reid. But I never introduce an artist until we have proven that there is public interest. That takes the “No” away before they even have time to think it.",

What is the music business like?\n\nMan (shaking head) it is not for the faint of heart, that’s for sure. But I love it. It’s exhilarating. It is the kindof business where everything is oversized. When you win, you do so in spectacular fashion. When you fail, you do so in spectacular fashion.”\n\nWhat would you say is the most consistent quality or an artist to have to make it?\n\nThere are 2 qualities to have that can help you thrive where others don’t. My experience is that the truly successful people in this business have a high tolerance for rejection. They are also great sales people. Notice I didn’t mention talent in that list.\n\nWe did. Why is that?\n\nTalent is obviously a big deal but most artist suffer under the delusion that once talent is demonstrated, that labels will come looking for them. The truth is that labels reject the most mind blowingly talented artist every day. Then they turn around and sign lesser talented artist. Why? Because the lesser talented artist is a better salesman and sold his music to the public in a convincing manner.\n\nIs that how you were able to get so many artists signed?\n\nYes. I have pitched acts to everyone from Justin Timberlake to LA Reid. But I never introduce an artist until we have proven that there is public interest. That takes the “No” away before they even have time to think it.",

I’ve become increasingly aware of the substantial amount of NYC content we've been serving here at AAHIPHOP, and I’m starting to feel like a dick. In the wake of the city’s newfound fame, It seems like a perfect time to put on my metaphorical Jay’s cap and start repping my city a little more.\n\nDon't call it a comeback, he's been here for years!\n\nThis time around, I want to talk about a cat named Rochester aka Juice. After winning Flow 93.5’s (the city’s primary mainstream urban radio station) Flow Search Showcase in 2002, he pretty much hit the ground running. My first introduction to hI'm as an artist was his Caribana themed video for the catchy single Do It off of his. The years that followed saw hI'm drop numerous songs/videos, rock stages with industry elite like G-Unit, and become the face of numerous campaigns for brands like the -- now defunct -- Athlete’s World stores, and Much Music’s Much Vibe, a 24/7 urban video station. Now, a decade since first bumping Juice, I’m sitting here checking out his latest EP, KARMAZABXTCH. It’s an eight-song offering that’s fresh, relevant and a wonderful way for Juice to reassert himself on the Toronto music landscape.\n\nKicking off with the club banger, Bad Girl, Rochester shows off an evolved flow that’s very “2016 Toronto.” His production is handled by some dope local beatsmiths, like J.Staffz and Anon London Beats. If I had to sum up the albums content, I’d say it ranges; He gets sexy on the bassy joints Say When and Karma Sutra, he gets personal on the lost love/broken heart vibe of Wounded Lips and goes all out on the EP closer Now Or Never.\n\nRochester seems like he was a decade too early; the level of notoriety he gained up here would have been mega-amplified within the scope of this “New-Toronto” wave that Drake, and cats like Jazz Cartier and Tory Lanez, seemed to have set-off. KARMAZABXTCH is sure to reignite the flame Rochester has ignited many times before. This time, though, all eyes are on the 6. With a few well-placed visuals (which Juice is known to drop), he could be looking at a whole new career plateau.\n \nEarly!",

    "title": "What If: We Imagine Possible 2016 Biggie Collabos",
    "content": "It's crazy that 19 years have elapsed since the rap game lost Notorious B.I.G. By many accounts, he was one of the most influential artists ever to touch a mic. you'd be hard-pressed to find a New York, New York, emcee (over 30) who doesn't name hI'm as a figure of artistic admiration – and why not? He was a true rag to riches story. In fact, I'd argue that his breakthrough Juicy is one of the greatest \"we made it\" musical-mantras in hip-hop. He was loyal, funny, and innovative. He put a LOT of artists on and is the reason many artists are eating today. He was a nucleus of New York street-hop, and had he not been killed, he'd likely be a jigga-esque figure today.\n\nIndeed, a lot of careers would have played out differently. His group, The Commission, which included Jay-Z and Charlie Baltimore, never saw the light of day; however, had he survived, their debut would undoubtedly be a hit. Where, though would that have left Kanye West? Jay-Z intertwined work with Biggie may have left listeners with fewer solo albums. As well, Diddy's Hitmen production team, which included the likes of D-Dot and Stevie J, would have handled a bulk of the Commission, and as a byproduct, Hova production.\n\nOne can only speculate about his love life, but (assuming things played out exactly as they did), you may see Jay and B sitting coutside with Biggie and KI'm – or maybe Biggie and Charlie Baltimore? Where would many of the lost/forgotten Bad Boy artists have ended up? Would Brooklyn Mint have become as monumental as Rocawear?\n\nSigh; so many what ifs.\n\nThere have been an endless stream of Biggie remixes, blends, and faux features, but it's especially fun to consider who he'd work with if he were alive today, and putting in work. We've compiled a few ideas below.\n\nDrake\n\nIt's hard to imagine than an artist as big (no pun intended) as Biggie wouldn't work with Drake. A definite sign of making it (in today's landscape) is collaborating within the circle of royalty that includes Ye, Jigga, T.I and Jeezy. Biggie would have rounded out that list. Imagine Biggie verses on Drake's biggest hits, like The Motto, or his classic posse cut with Ye and Eminem. Biggie may have certainly had some beef, assuming he'd been defending his crown for over two decades. So, imagine – if you will – hI'm addressing his grievances on Drizzy's newest hit, \"Summer 16.\" Wow.\n\nKanye\n\nNo brainer, assuming Kanye's career path happened exactly as it did, by this time he would have likely collaborated extensively with Biggie. Perhaps he would have had hI'm talking his fly shit over the chimpmunk soul wave that drowned the airwaves circa 2001 (the Oh Boy era). It's especially interesting to imagine Biggie riding along with this new Yeezus chapter of Kanye's career. We've imagined BIG dropping bars on Ye's The Life Of Pablo album, specifically on the ultra dope Friends. Perhaps a verse dedicated to Puff and the Junior Mafia?\n\nKendrick Lamar\n\nKing Kunta, the Compton wonder-child, would almost have certainly been a worthy collaborator for the King Of New York. This rings especially true if you stop to consider Biggie's infatuation with the West – as heard on the epic Goin Back To Cali off of Life After Death. It's likely that we might have seen a slew of West Coast collaborations throughout the late 90's and at the turn of the century. Who knows, his love of the warmer coast may have seen hI'm cross paths with Madlib or Dilla during Stone Throw's rise to infamy. Kunta's grandeur within the circle of rapper's rappers seem to suggest that he'll remain name on tongues for years to come – a pillar of the game not unlike B.I.G. Let's imagine Biggie dropping a verse on K.Dot's Alright joint; hot right?\n\nJustin Bieber\n\nWith the success of Hypnotize, and Mo Money, Mo Problems, Biggie was clearly able to attain and mainstream crossover success. With label-mate Ma$e also following in his footsteps and helping Bad Boy rake in mad dough, it's clear that making radio friendly shit, and dropping 16's on charting radio hits was a profitable endeavor. The formula has always existed – and it's likely Bieber may have tapped the Brooklynite for a verse, or perhaps vice-versa. It's all business and these days, Bieber is good money! Can you imagine Biggie's vocal tone blessing uptempo club records like Sorry\n\nBeyoncé\n\nNo brainer – just saying.\n\nTaylor Swift\n\nFollowing the same logic I applied to the Bieber example, there's a chance that Biggie may have worked with someone like Taylor. Before you say anything, she collaborated with K.Dot on Bad Blood – imagine an alternate remix with Biggie, though?",
    "clean_content": "It's crazy that 19 years have elapsed since the rap game lost Notorious B.I.G. By many accounts, he was one of the most influential artists ever to touch a mic. you'd be hard-pressed to find a New York, New York, emcee (over 30) who doesn't name hI'm as a figure of artistic admiration – and why not? He was a true rag to riches story. In fact, I'd argue that his breakthrough Juicy is one of the greatest \"we made it\" musical-mantras in hip-hop. He was loyal, funny, and innovative. He put a LOT of artists on and is the reason many artists are eating today. He was a nucleus of New York street-hop, and had he not been killed, he'd likely be a jigga-esque figure today.\n\nIndeed, a lot of careers would have played out differently. His group, The Commission, which included Jay-Z and Charlie Baltimore, never saw the light of day; however, had he survived, their debut would undoubtedly be a hit. Where, though would that have left Kanye West? Jay-Z intertwined work with Biggie may have left listeners with fewer solo albums. As well, Diddy's Hitmen production team, which included the likes of D-Dot and Stevie J, would have handled a bulk of the Commission, and as a byproduct, Hova production.\n\nOne can only speculate about his love life, but (assuming things played out exactly as they did), you may see Jay and B sitting coutside with Biggie and KI'm – or maybe Biggie and Charlie Baltimore? Where would many of the lost/forgotten Bad Boy artists have ended up? Would Brooklyn Mint have become as monumental as Rocawear?\n\nSigh; so many what ifs.\n\nThere have been an endless stream of Biggie remixes, blends, and faux features, but it's especially fun to consider who he'd work with if he were alive today, and putting in work. We've compiled a few ideas below.\n\nDrake\n\nIt's hard to imagine than an artist as big (no pun intended) as Biggie wouldn't work with Drake. A definite sign of making it (in today's landscape) is collaborating within the circle of royalty that includes Ye, Jigga, T.I and Jeezy. Biggie would have rounded out that list. Imagine Biggie verses on Drake's biggest hits, like The Motto, or his classic posse cut with Ye and Eminem. Biggie may have certainly had some beef, assuming he'd been defending his crown for over two decades.

    "content": "It’s been 19 years today since the Notorious BIG passed away; although, it seems like yesterday for OG heads. Often included in the average MC’s top list, Biggie was a highly influential figure in the NYC scene, and was responsible for helping a lot of people solidify their names in the rap world. For the past (almost) two decades since his passing, many DJ’s have tried their hand at crafting remixes and re-working the (sadly) limited amount of material he left us with, attempting to give fans a new B.I.G experience. I’ve taken the liberty of rounding-up three of the best – and most creative – Biggie tapes I've come across.\n\n“Rap Phenomenon”\nDJ Vlad & DJ Dirty Harry\n\nIf you’ve never heard this tape, it easily stands as one of the finest – and most iconic – Notorious B.I.G mixtapes out there. This installment of their award winning \"Rap Phenomenon\" series was an example of both Vlad in his prime, almost a decade away from launching VladTV.com, and DJ Dirty Harry's legendary blending. The two traded over forty mind-blowing original mixes; keep in mind, this was pre-torrent days, so their stock of Biggie accapellas was a big deal. Especially the (then) rare ones like “Cars Sex,” “Buddy X,” and “House Of Pain.”\n\n“Best Of Notorious BIG”\nDJ M-Rock\n\nAward-winning Toronto DJ, M-Rock, has made massive noise over the past few years. He rocks parties as a resident DJ in the 6, had MTV nodding to his mixtapes, and had CNN mentioning his remixes. He’s received widespread blog love for his “Best Of” mixes, including Beastie Boys and Kanye West, but this Biggie mix is a sheer masterpiece. Unlike some of the mixes out there, it’s heavily cut up – making it an extremely original/exciting listen.\n\n“The Notorious BIG Tribute”\nDJ Drama & Cookin Soul\n\nThis one is more of a tribute in the literal sense. Drama and Cookin’ Soul rounded up a who’s who of NYC rappers, like Tek of Smiff N Wessun, Skyzoo, CL Smooth, Jean Grae, Uncle Murda and more. It features original and remixed production, as the artists pay tribute to one of the greatest to ever touch a mic.\n\nSalute the king of Brooklyn.",

    "content": "Photo credit: Mamboso.net\n\nHip-hop, in it's current iteration, comes -- and goes -- in waves. The waves all have catalysts (like Drake, Kid Cudi, or younger drill gods like Keef, Santana, and Dirk), and set the stage for a tsunami of similarity. Rappers, influenced by other rappers, borrow flows which influence other rappers; you see where I'm going. The cycle continues until one brave soul goes against the grain and challenges the norm, setting off another chain reaction. It's hard to imagine fully an artist without a direct influence or at least a point of reference. Well, perhaps you haven't heard of Coke La Rock, widely accepted to be the first rapper ever to touch a mic.\n\nHistory shows that at the infamous 1973 party that DJ Kool Herc threw for his sister Cindy, hip-hop was born, in every way possible. Herc changed the game, of course, but -- most important to this conversation -- a young (street) rapper who was then known as A1 Coke, or Coco, grabbed the mic and changed the world. Amidst playfully calling out his homies, using an echo chamber, he dropped the following:\n\n\"There is not a man that can’t be thrown\nA horse that can’t be rode\nA bull that can’t be stopped\nThere is not a disco that I Coke La Rock can’t rock.\"\n\nJust like that, the first rap infected the crowd and quickly spread and took on a life of its own. Coke, shortly after Kool Herc was stabbed a party some years later, walked away from rap. A move, he said at the time, was partly to let some of the younger cats have a chance at wearing the crown. Unfortunately, Coke came up in an era that pre-dates a constant documenting of experiences. Thus, we're left only with stories and beautifully preserved digital copies of 1970's and 80's party fliers.\n\nIs there a point or lesson to this? Yes. Coke La Rock often describes what he did that night as just having fun with his friends. He had no preconceived notions of fame, no desire to sign a deal -- he didn't even have rhymes written. He didn't record any records! It was improvisational, organic, and inspiring. It was, quite literally, the purest example of hip-hop ever.\n\nThe lesson is that artists need to take some time to listen to their inner voice, and find a way to materialize that into their music. Music doesn't have to be a jumble of influences outside of your experience. As well, genuine admiration for an artist doesn't have to lead directly to similar music. Stop trying so hard to fit in, and work harder at standing out. Listen to your heart -- it will tell you if you're truly in this game for the right reason. If Coke La Rock can do it, you can to!\n\nStop biting!\n\nTo learn more about Coke La Rock’s Story, check out this great video by Steve Hager.

After a solid listen to his first mixtape, \"Don Quixote,” and his latest mixtape, “Black AmeriKKKa,” it's clear to see he goes over and above the booty and bling, delivering sociopolitical messages to his listeners. Jimmy Heights is establishing himself at the head of the young hip hop class, and demonstrating that he’s a force to be reckoned with; get to know Jimmy, below, as he takes our world-famous AAHIPHOP Q&A\n\nHow did you get involved in hip-hop?\n\nBelieve it or not, the first hip-hop song I ever heard came from Bow Wow. I just remember getting ready for school and the song played on the TV. I was probably like 5, and I was only used to soca that my parents played around in the house or Michael Jackson, who was my favorite artist at the time. Ever since that day, I followed hip hop closely. Starting off with Bow Wow and my love elevated even more after 50 Cent debuted. I was about nine at that time. He made me love the art of hip-hop.\n\nWho were some of your influences?\n\nI'm influenced by just about everything. Growing up my biggest influences were 50 Cent and Kanye West even though my style was pretty different from both. These days, I got a lot of Young Thug in my playlist along with plenty other of these young artists out here. I just gain influence from everyone or personal experiences. I might like the way a certain Lupe Fiasco beat sound along with the cadences of a Lil Durk hook. I listen to just about everyone’s music which in turn just betters the product I’m trying to put out.\n\nTell me about your music – what are you currently working on?\n\nI’m still working on my first EP, “Skinny Dippin’ With Naked B*tches in Poland”. I have a video that I recently recorded that's supposed to drop next week called “Potent” featuring my boy Ravage Roc. I got a lot in store. I’ve been writing every day. A lot of work in the arsenal. I’d love to release a new video every month. So we’ll see what happens.\n\nHow would you describe your sound?\n\nMy sound is refreshing, harmonic, melodic, emotional, ravishing and raw. I might be one of the few young guys that can put a hook together but also keep it “lyrical”. I try to cater to both sides of hip hop fans. The ones that like to sing along to the hooks and the fans that decipher each and every word in the verse. Songs that could be played on the radio and in the club but also could be played when your alone and going thru it or just bumping. \n\nWhat are your goals in the industry?\n\nI don’t think I would want to be an artist forever. Probably have a good successful little run as an artist. In the latter years, I want to move around behind the scenes. Work with other artists songwriting, producing and all the other good stuff. Hopefully by my 40s, I could lead a successful entertainment company.\n\nWhat do you want people to take away from you as an artist?\n\nThe works of a creative genius. I put a lot of work into my music and videos. Obviously, my budget isn’t huge for my whole idea to be put on a platter, but when I reach that platform appreciate my creativity and uniqueness. There’s not another Jimmy Heights. \n\nDo you want to remain independent or sign to a major label?\n\nOf course, I’d love to stay independent. With the way that the music industry is moving with all resources available to unsigned artists, it makes sense to stay independent. But if the right deal comes along that could set my family for life, it would be stupid and selfish to pass up on it.",

He made me love the art of hip-hop.\n\nWho were some of your influences?\n\nI'm influenced by just about everything. Growing up my biggest influences were 50 Cent and Kanye West even though my style was pretty different from both. These days, I got a lot of Young Thug in my playlist along with plenty other of these young artists out here. I just gain influence from everyone or personal experiences. I might like the way a certain Lupe Fiasco beat sound along with the cadences of a Lil Durk hook. I listen to just about everyone’s music which in turn just betters the product I’m trying to put out.\n\nTell me about your music – what are you currently working on?\n\nI’m still working on my first EP, “Skinny Dippin’ With Naked B*tches in Poland”. I have a video that I recently recorded that's supposed to drop next week called “Potent” featuring my boy Ravage Roc. I got a lot in store. I’ve been writing every day. A lot of work in the arsenal. I’d love to release a new video every month. So we’ll see what happens.\n\nHow would you describe your sound?\n\nMy sound is refreshing, harmonic, melodic, emotional, ravishing and raw. I might be one of the few young guys that can put a hook together but also keep it “lyrical”. I try to cater to both sides of hip hop fans. The ones that like to sing along to the hooks and the fans that decipher each and every word in the verse. Songs that could be played on the radio and in the club but also could be played when your alone and going thru it or just bumping. \n\nWhat are your goals in the industry?\n\nI don’t think I would want to be an artist forever. Probably have a good successful little run as an artist. In the latter years, I want to move around behind the scenes. Work with other artists songwriting, producing and all the other good stuff. Hopefully by my 40s, I could lead a successful entertainment company.\n\nWhat do you want people to take away from you as an artist?\n\nThe works of a creative genius. I put a lot of work into my music and videos. Obviously, my budget isn’t huge for my whole idea to be put on a platter, but when I reach that platform appreciate my creativity and uniqueness. There’s not another Jimmy Heights. \n\nDo you want to remain independent or sign to a major label?\n\nOf course, I’d love to stay independent. With the way that the music industry is moving with all resources available to unsigned artists, it makes sense to stay independent. But if the right deal comes along that could set my family for life, it would be stupid and selfish to pass up on it.",

    "content": "I work on music EVERY SINGLE DAY. Not because I have to...but because I owe music. \n\nGrind and hustle can never truly be appreciated by the general public; unless they're your day ones, they probably can't comprehend that you've been through a gang of peaks and valleys to get where you're at. Producer/DJ Supe is a great example -- from making music and rocking parties while living in his car, to a successful run as a radio station DJ, and active figure on the concert, festival, and club scene, he's put in work.\n\nCurrently, he's hitting the streets hard promoting his new release, \"Guilty,\" a silky new tune with singer Ayanna Charlene. We caught up with DJ Supe, who told us about the track, his influences and how he got started in the industry.\n\nHow did you get started?\n\nI used to listen to \"The God Emcee,\" Rakim, like all the time in elementary school! So I started rapping and getting my flows tight. My dad had an old reel to reel player, and I used to record myself over old Funkadelic records. I had to splice the tape together when it broke from hours of playing it. I got pretty good chopping them tapes together right on the beat and made my own mixtapes. Started rapping freshman year but got drawn to deejaying my senior year. My high school friends and I started a group called Flo-Magnum, and eventually Ebro called me to guest DJ when he had a radio show in my hometown Sacramento.. (peace to DJ Tone Pesci for letting me cover for him). The rest is history.\n\nProduction/DJ wise, who are some of your influences?\n\nSome of my influences on production are DJ Premier, Dr. Dre, and The Neptunes. My DJ influences are DJ Qbert, DJ Kid Capri and DJ Jazzy Jeff (he is going to spin at my wedding one day). I like these guys because they cut and scratch, but they also know how to rock a party. They won't scratch all off beat just to show you how fast their wrist is. They do it fluidly – that's how I do it. Most importantly, I can't forget the guys around here in California that raised me, DJ Gino, DJ Racer X, Sam Starks, and DJ Tosh who gave me a lot of good advice while spinning on the air.\n\nWhat are you currently promoting?\n\nRight now I am promoting a single I produced called \"Guilty\" which is on iTunes, Google Play, Tidal, Spotify, etc. The artist who sang on the track is Ayanna Charlene, and the song is from her EP called The Cut Off that I wholly produced due out later this year. I am also working closely with artists to showcase their videos on my #DJSupeQuickMix series. They are 15-minute music video mixes that you can find on my website. They are also available on my app DJ Supe Mobile, which is on The App Store for iOS and Google Play for Android devices. Look for a few artists I am producing for on my EP called Weirdo due out Fall 2016; Tanjanae, Pacific Sunrise, Ruben Eaton, Carla Lawrence, and Genesis.\n\nHow would you describe your production?\n\nMy music is a fusion of modern Hip-Hop drums, Trip Hop, and downtempo ambient sounds. I combine that with R&B/Soul chords and instruments like Rhodes and organs to create a darker but still melodic flow. Singers love it; rap artists that like to experiment with me find the groove, too.\n\nWhat are your goals in the industry?\n\nMy goals are to make a living at what I do. It's not about getting rich. It's about establishing a legacy. I love to spin records, but I also love to spin my records! So I guess deejaying is the foundation. Been doing a few concerts with Bombay VIP, which is the direction I want to go...more festivals and concerts. Want to keep that going while I continue to develop artists under my production. Having a hot single doesn't hurt either!\n\nWhat do you want people to take away from you as a producer?\n\nMy tenacious work ethic is what I want people to recognize me for. I work on music EVERY SINGLE DAY. Not because I have to...but because I owe music. I used to be homeless living in my car and making music and rocking parties AT THE SAME DAMN TIME! That was the only thing that kept me going. That is how I fed myself, so I am going to feed it back. Give and take you know?",

    "title": "Kollage: Bahamadia’s Classic Debut Turns Twenty (Interview)",
    "content": "Female hip-hop artists have – arguably – had a much harder time commanding the respect they deserve in hip-hop. It’s no fault of their own, but rather that of the old boys club structure that, although accommodating, was somewhat slanted towards male counterparts. Indeed, it’s impossible not to argue that the golden era of hip-hop only had a small handful of notable female voices. Names like Queen Latifah, Monie Love, Salt-N-Pepa, and Mc Lyte all saw success in the early 90’s. However, as hip-hop grew, [some] female rappers started to become less artistic, and more strategic (marketing wise).\n\nAlthough still solid pillars of the culture, they relied on sexuality (and behind the scenes influence) to stand out as the prominent female member of their click — as if merely being a woman wasn’t enough. Not all artists prescribed to this recipe, though. One notable name that went against the grain was Bahamadia, straight out of the city of brotherly love, which has a long history of churning out successful hip-hop figures.\n\nDiscovered by the late Guru, Bahamadia was an MC in the purest form -- all bars, and doing what she was born to do. She’s not a female MC; she’s an MC, period. Her classic album, Kollage, which featured production credits from the likes of DJ Premier and Erick Sermon (amongst others), is celebrating 20 years this month — and it holds up. We recently spoke with Bahamadia, who shared some background on her classic debut, lessons learned from Guru and more. Check out the interview below.\n\nSo, you were part of the Gang Starr foundation, right?\n\nYeah, I was under Guru's Tutelage...\n\nOkay, so that’s interesting. You're under Guru’s tutelage. How did he guide you, or how did he help influence Kollage? How’d you connect with him?\n\nWell, I had a [regional] hit out in ’93 called Funk Vibe that me and another producer out here at the time, named DJ Randy, who was one of the leading DJs on Philadelphia commercial radio. Through a friend, I found out he was searching for a female vocalist at the time. He reached out over the phone, I got with him, and the next thing you know I'm in the studio. Funk Vibe was released on a label called IQ Records and began to chart. From there, the who’s who of people, names like Dr. Dre, were all interested in signing me -- based on this one single.\n\nIt just happened that a friend of my sister was dating Guru at the time. I found out about it, and got this friend to take a tape to the girl; she passed it along -- and he liked it. I was already a fan of Gang Starr and felt that would be the best fit for me at the time. The rest has been what it has been.\n\nWhat was the process like, putting together Kollage?\n\nYou know people go in the studio, and they do songs for an album, and they might do 50 to 100 songs. They pick the best out and narrow it down to what will be considered for the project. Well, every song I did for Kollage, I never had any surplus material, so everything that I did went on the record. Guru and I got in the studio and recorded, and I thought that was going to be a batch of songs, but the next thing I know it had led to a video and all this kind of stuff. It snowballed into touring with the Fugees and… you know, so that’s how that happened.\n\nI felt like I was at home when I met Premier and everybody that was in the studio -- we just gelled, and it unfolded on its own. You know how sometimes you may be a part of something and, in hindsight, it wound up being something monumental?\n\nYou know, I think every great thing that ever happened to someone was like that. I don’t think people ever stop and say, hmm, this is monumental! \n\nI've been in a dream state ever since l started professionally, honestly. Haha. It’s crazy. And you never, like, you're never not famous to somebody -- you think you're under the radar for years, somebody at the supermarket, somebody at the airport, somebody's on you, like \"Yo!\"\n\nAbsolutely. And you had a lot of features too like you popped up on a lot of records randomly. The first time I heard you as an artist was the record \"Ladies in the House.\"\n\nThat was real dope. It was dope. That was a fun record. I experienced first hand in the early days that a lot of stuff used to be staged -- it was all political, like marketing you know? Strategies and things like that; but, all my stuff ended up being organic. I only work with people that I have a connection with, and I'm natural with, you know, so, that’s the way I approach my music [even today].\n\nI don’t create unless I'm inspired by something. I'm disciplined to write and create on the spot, but, I prefer to do it organically, you know? Because that makes it art, to me.\n\nDid you find any pressure around that? In you early days, a lot of female MCs were using their sexuality to sell records. Did you have any label pressure to keep up?\n\nFirst of all, I don’t consider myself to be a female MC. I'm an artist number one. Secondly, I don’t feel pressure about something I was built to do. I didn't have any restraints and was afforded the luxury of navigating my path regarding what I do, and who I collaborate with. When it comes to me feeling pressured about something that I was born to do—no.\n\nNever pressure, because I don’t measure my performance by any standards except for the one I’ve been given, but that’s the way I look at things.\n\nI love that, because female MCs became such a focal point in rap crews, and it just got...I was like they wanted people to be hyper-aware that they were women. I never felt that about you. You were just a lyricist. \n\nMy approach had never been that because when I came out, I mean of course you knew I was a woman -- and you can look at me when I show up and know that I'm African-American, too.\n\nYeah, haha!\n\nLet’s get down to the bottom line which is the talent, the art, and the message in the music. I'm not even concerned about reaching a target audience, just reaching people that get what I'm doing, and that gravitate towards what I do. That's the way it is for me. I mean the female thing, though, I guess that’s a business in music. That’s not the culture in hip hop. I'm an organic, authentic hip-hopper so…\n\nAbsolutely. I mean that era was right on the cusp, you know what I'm saying? Hip-hop got bigger and reached extreme heights, so business took over.\n\nEverything was still developing at that time. When I came on as a solo artist, a solo female, I didn’t even know that the majority of women that were in the music industry at that time, especially from the traditional hip-hop standpoint, didn’t pen lyrics. I thought that everybody wrote their lyrics... all the men did their lyrics, all the women did their lyrics. You know, I didn’t know that. When I realized it was structured as a business like R&B and all the other genres, I was like wow, okay.\n\nSo that being said, I didn’t have any influence because Guru and them, they gave me knowledge regarding the business I was doing and taught me not to compromise my art. He taught me things like not letting anybody put a time restraint on when I should put music out. He told me all that stuff about publishing; making sure my publishing was straight. All those things.\n\nJust being afforded the opportunity to express me in an organic place is just… I don’t have a lot of words for it. A lot of women were used as a novelty in this game; you know what I mean? A majority of them had men behind them, and they were using them just to articulate a vision or an idea or concept they had [as men], having them express themselves the way they think women'should' express themselves. My experience came from a different place—I was talking about parenting, a lot of different things that was like...people weren’t really in touch with those topics at that time. And again, that was just me doing me; art is an expression of life -- and I feel like that’s why I was just talking about the things that I know from my heart, you know? So that’s how that happened.\n\nSo what are you working on now?\n\nI'm into app development a little bit, and I have a series that I do strictly on my phone. As well, the 20-year anniversary thing is coming up; and [at the universal hip hop museum] we’re having our first event celebrating women’s contribution to hip hop, in the industry, and in the culture. That's starting June 3rd.\n\n\"I don’t create unless I'm inspired by something. I'm disciplined to write and create on the spot, but, I prefer to do it organically, you know? Because that makes it art, to me.\"",

However, as hip-hop grew, [some] female rappers started to become less artistic, and more strategic (marketing wise).\n\nAlthough still solid pillars of the culture, they relied on sexuality (and behind the scenes influence) to stand out as the prominent female member of their click — as if merely being a woman wasn’t enough. Not all artists prescribed to this recipe, though. One notable name that went against the grain was Bahamadia, straight out of the city of brotherly love, which has a long history of churning out successful hip-hop figures.\n\nDiscovered by the late Guru, Bahamadia was an MC in the purest form -- all bars, and doing what she was born to do. She’s not a female MC; she’s an MC, period. Her classic album, Kollage, which featured production credits from the likes of DJ Premier and Erick Sermon (amongst others), is celebrating 20 years this month — and it holds up. We recently spoke with Bahamadia, who shared some background on her classic debut, lessons learned from Guru and more. Check out the interview below.\n\nSo, you were part of the Gang Starr foundation, right?\n\nYeah, I was under Guru's Tutelage...\n\nOkay, so that’s interesting. You're under Guru’s tutelage. How did he guide you, or how did he help influence Kollage? How’d you connect with him?\n\nWell, I had a [regional] hit out in ’93 called Funk Vibe that me and another producer out here at the time, named DJ Randy, who was one of the leading DJs on Philadelphia commercial radio. Through a friend, I found out he was searching for a female vocalist at the time. He reached out over the phone, I got with him, and the next thing you know I'm in the studio. Funk Vibe was released on a label called IQ Records and began to chart. From there, the who’s who of people, names like Dr. Dre, were all interested in signing me -- based on this one single.\n\nIt just happened that a friend of my sister was dating Guru at the time. I found out about it, and got this friend to take a tape to the girl; she passed it along -- and he liked it. I was already a fan of Gang Starr and felt that would be the best fit for me at the time. The rest has been what it has been.\n\nWhat was the process like, putting together Kollage?\n\nYou know people go in the studio, and they do songs for an album, and they might do 50 to 100 songs. They pick the best out and narrow it down to what will be considered for the project. Well, every song I did for Kollage, I never had any surplus material, so everything that I did went on the record. Guru and I got in the studio and recorded, and I thought that was going to be a batch of songs, but the next thing I know it had led to a video and all this kind of stuff. It snowballed into touring with the Fugees and… you know, so that’s how that happened.\n\nI felt like I was at home when I met Premier and everybody that was in the studio -- we just gelled, and it unfolded on its own. You know how sometimes you may be a part of something and, in hindsight, it wound up being something monumental?\n\nYou know, I think every great thing that ever happened to someone was like that. I don’t think people ever stop and say, hmm, this is monumental! \n\nI've been in a dream state ever since l started professionally, honestly. Haha. It’s crazy. And you never, like, you're never not famous to somebody -- you think you're under the radar for years, somebody at the supermarket, somebody at the airport, somebody's on you, like \"Yo!\"\n\nAbsolutely. And you had a lot of features too like you popped up on a lot of records randomly. The first time I heard you as an artist was the record \"Ladies in the House.\"\n\nThat was real dope. It was dope. That was a fun record. I experienced first hand in the early days that a lot of stuff used to be staged -- it was all political, like marketing you know? Strategies and things like that; but, all my stuff ended up being organic. I only work with people that I have a connection with, and I'm natural with, you know, so, that’s the way I approach my music [even today].\n\nI don’t create unless I'm inspired by something. I'm disciplined to write and create on the spot, but, I prefer to do it organically, you know? Because that makes it art, to me.\n\nDid you find any pressure around that? In you early days, a lot of female MCs were using their sexuality to sell records. Did you have any label pressure to keep up?\n\nFirst of all, I don’t consider myself to be a female MC. I'm an artist number one. Secondly, I don’t feel pressure about something I was built to do. I didn't have any restraints and was afforded the luxury of navigating my path regarding what I do, and who I collaborate with. When it comes to me feeling pressured about something that I was born to do—no.\n\nNever pressure, because I don’t measure my performance by any standards except for the one I’ve been given, but that’s the way I look at things.\n\nI love that, because female MCs became such a focal point in rap crews, and it just got...I was like they wanted people to be hyper-aware that they were women. I never felt that about you. You were just a lyricist. \n\nMy approach had never been that because when I came out, I mean of course you knew I was a woman -- and you can look at me when I show up and know that I'm African-American, too.\n\nYeah, haha!\n\nLet’s get down to the bottom line which is the talent, the art, and the message in the music. I'm not even concerned about reaching a target audience, just reaching people that get what I'm doing, and that gravitate towards what I do. That's the way it is for me. I mean the female thing, though, I guess that’s a business in music. That’s not the culture in hip hop. I'm an organic, authentic hip-hopper so…\n\nAbsolutely. I mean that era was right on the cusp, you know what I'm saying? Hip-hop got bigger and reached extreme heights, so business took over.\n\nEverything was still developing at that time. When I came on as a solo artist, a solo female, I didn’t even know that the majority of women that were in the music industry at that time, especially from the traditional hip-hop standpoint, didn’t pen lyrics. I thought that everybody wrote their lyrics... all the men did their lyrics, all the women did their lyrics. You know, I didn’t know that. When I realized it was structured as a business like R&B and all the other genres, I was like wow, okay.\n\nSo that being said, I didn’t have any influence because Guru and them, they gave me knowledge regarding the business I was doing and taught me not to compromise my art. He taught me things like not letting anybody put a time restraint on when I should put music out. He told me all that stuff about publishing; making sure my publishing was straight. All those things.\n\nJust being afforded the opportunity to express me in an organic place is just… I don’t have a lot of words for it. A lot of women were used as a novelty in this game; you know what I mean? A majority of them had men behind them, and they were using them just to articulate a vision or an idea or concept they had [as men], having them express themselves the way they think women'should' express themselves. My experience came from a different place—I was talking about parenting, a lot of different things that was like...people weren’t really in touch with those topics at that time. And again, that was just me doing me; art is an expression of life -- and I feel like that’s why I was just talking about the things that I know from my heart, you know? So that’s how that happened.\n\nSo what are you working on now?\n\nI'm into app development a little bit, and I have a series that I do strictly on my phone. As well, the 20-year anniversary thing is coming up; and [at the universal hip hop museum] we’re having our first event celebrating women’s contribution to hip hop, in the industry, and in the culture. That's starting June 3rd.\n\n\"I don’t create unless I'm inspired by something. I'm disciplined to write and create on the spot, but, I prefer to do it organically, you know? Because that makes it art, to me.\"",

Secondly, he’s gone back to his [fashion] roots in a major way, teaming up with Adidas to produce signature sneakers and gear; however, Ferg could only keep his day one fans waiting for so long. With a significant buzz that began with the single/video \"Next Level\" featuring Future, his latest album Always Strive & Prosper is here – and it’s full of surprises.\n\nAs a self-identified Ferg fan, the album has an unexpected aura to it. Unlike his Trap Lord LP, AS&P is much more introspective and personal.

He sets the tone for the album on the second song – and first leak – “Hungry Ham,” a reference to his OG stomping grounds of Hamilton Heights. The Skrillex produced banger sees Ferg opening himself up and speaking on finite personal anecdotes, like his mother’s reaction to hI'm dropping everything to rap. He talks more about his family on the [two-part] “Psycho,\" where he breaks down his relationship with his gangster uncle, and the influence it had on him; the story continues seamlessly with the song “Let It Bang,’ featuring Schoolboy Q.\n\nThe surprises on this album, though, are his professions of love on “Let You Go,” and – the damn-near marriage proposal – “I Love You.” As well, his pro-positivity techno-infused dose of reality, \"Strive\" (featuring Missy), is bound to the song of the summer. He also drops a very gentle/surface call to [#blacklivesmatter] action on “Beautiful People,\" and pays proper tribute to Yams on “Yammer Style,” which ends with (Yam’s) mother proclaiming that they are keeping his legacy alive.\n\nAfter three solid listens to the 18 song effort, I feel as though I’m more into Ferg as a person; he gives listeners a chance to get to understand hI'm a bit more clearly.

He's the Dougie Howser of the DJ game!\n\nNow, after two decades in the game, John has done everything but slow down. From rocking private events and charity functions to producing progressive house and hip-hop remixes, he's continuing to grow his brand in a major way. We recently took some time out to chat with John about his career, his influences, and so much more. Check the interview below.\n\nHow did you get involved in DJ'ing?\n\nIt kinda started by accident; I was curious about radio sounds and\nmessing around with equipment in the house. Got my first Turntable at 9, started doing College parties for my sister around 12. From there I knew I wanted to keep going… I liked it too much, and I never looked back.\n\nWho are some of your influences?\n\nDJ Kool Herc! A significant influence for doing what he did [helping build the genre]. Most DJ’s and Artist forget about that. DJ AM has been a huge influence on me growing up; I loved his musical range and creativity. DJ Riz DJ Sizzahandz -- The Crooklyn Clan. I have a lot of respect and admiration for the pioneers of the game who elevated the craft.\n\nDescribe yourself as a DJ -- what's your sound? What do you love to spin?\n\nI pride myself as an open format DJ, so my sound is high-energy and all over the place. Depending on the night and crowd, I’m doing anything from Hip-hop/R&B and dancehall reggae to tribal house, Dance - Trap, reggaeton or bachata; I even hit the crowd with some slow jams this past weekend! And they LOVED IT!\n\nDo you create your own music?\n\nYeah, I make my music, but I wouldn’t consider myself a producer at this point. My primary focus is on getting better with my technical DJ skills and finding new creative ways to get the crowd moving. I'm a DJ 1st!\n\nWhat makes you unique as a DJ?\n\nMy energy for sure; I try to develop a relationship with the crowd every night, so they stay connected Battle/party rock hybrid.\n\nWhat are some of you fave venues you've performed at?\n\nI’ve had some great experiences playing at Marquee, Cielo, and Pacha in particular. Some of my other favorite spots are Studio Square, Public House, and Lexicon. For me it's all about the vibe you create in a room.\n\nTell me a story of your wildest gig.\n\nA little while ago I did a set at Studio Square with “Quiet Events.\" There was something about the crowd and their energy that night, very different in all my years. I’ve never had a room like this; from girls rushing and twerking on the stage to girls jumping on the stage to dance with me. The crowd was screaming the words to songs back at me like I’ve never seen -- it was dope.\n\nWhat is your fave track of 2016 thus far?\n\n\"Promise,\" by  Kid Ink ft. Fetty Wap. The vibe is everything on this record, and I appreciate the message they put forward in the video.\n\nAny last word for the blog?\n\nI’m just incredibly humbled by the experience so far. It’s been a wild ride, and I’m grateful to be on it. 2016 has been my best year so far, and I’m very excited for more big things.

    "content": "Dead Reputation, the trio of 22-year-old NXUS, Delirious Beats (producer/engineer) and Rake (writer/videographer/film editor/photographer), certainly have a lot going for them. They have the type of sound and imagery that gives writers like me what can only be described as a \"writer boner.\" Self-professed semi-conscious hip hop, you can feel the aura of these cats, and can pretty much deduce it's only a matter of time. Their latest song/video, \"Rake Cat,\" is dark, lyrical, and fun to watch. In case you missed it, their previous video \"Scopolamine\" had over 100-thousand hits on Youtube.\n\nAfter you're done with the latest from Dead Rep, you'll want to check out NXUS' latest EP, the six-track Bando Music The Tales Of Peter Pyraxx. \"Recycle Raps,\" and \"Foreign,\" should find their way on to your playlist this week. While he only started recording a couple of years ago, NXUS has written hundreds of songs and hired out as an industry ghostwriter. \n\nNXUS and his circle are definitely on the road to the riches; keep your eyes and ears ready. You heard it here first!",

    "title": "#IndieFeature: MPYRE – TWO STOCK",
    "content": "We've featured rapper MPYRE here on AAHIPHOP in the past -- here's a refresher. This time around, though, I sat with his full mixtape, TWO-STOCK. Let me back up, I'm getting too excited. MPYRE is a Philapino rapper who hails from Chicago, which is arguable one of the most eclectic musical melting pots anywhere. Ground zero for some of the most groundbreaking jazz music ever, drill music, and conscious hip-hop from the likes of Common and Lupe, artists emerging from the street of Chi-town could go many ways. MPYRE is bringing a very jazzy, mid-western hip-hop vibe that at a time takes me back to early days of Kanye on the ROC (aesthetically). TWO STOCK is eight tracks long -- very concise, well paced, and well organized.\n\nNow the goods. He covers a broad range of topics and directions, from police violence, terrible luck with relationships, some good old fashioned macking, depression, and more. The soulful hooks by Becca Brown on tracks like [one of my faves], \"Rosetta Stone\" -- probably one of the more unique'trying to holla at a girl' concepts I've heard in a while -- is perfect. She also kills the vibed out \"Chiberia,\" where MPYRE calls out Chicago politicians and references Laquan MacDonald's murder while simultaneously airing frustrations over the state of \"Chiraq,\" and the cities chilly climate. \n\nAnother huge record and big look for the rapper is the mixtapes closer, \"Step By Step,\" which features Saba, whom Some of you may have heard on Chance The Rapper's \"Angels.\" \n\nThe album is well-arranged and flows like a lake. The vibe feels like it would translate well into a live performance with a live band and horn section. It's personal, real, and just a good clean listen to free-of filler. For a debut mixtape, it shows a ton of promise. MPYRE is another artist we're putting on our official watch-list. If anymore talent falls on our laps, we'll have to open an office out there!\n\nBe sure to add TWO STOCK to your playlist this weekend.",

    "title": "It's Dark and Hell Is Hot: DMX's Debut Turns 18",
    "content": "In their latest podcast, XXL's EIC Vanessa Satten, Jack Thriller, Dj Suss One, and Torae, debated whether younger heads needed to be schooled on the history of the culture. It was mostly in direct response to a recent controversy surrounding a tweet referring to Nas as Esco, which young-Twitter immediately jumped all over, accusing XXL of making an error [infuriating older heads in the process]. One of the great takeaways, though, was that we need to take the initiative to teach younger generations about the history of the culture, when at all possible.\n\nWell, today is the 18th anniversary of DMX's debut album, It's Dark and He'll Is Hot, and rather than merely pointing it out, I felt it necessary to be part of the solution and discuss why the album matters. Today DMX is a shell of his former self; unfortunately, most 90's babies missed D in his heyday, so they may not understand why he gets a consecutive pass from the hip-hop community.\n\nAllow me to break it down.\n\nBy the time May, 1998, rolled around, buzz for DMX’s impending full-length album was at a fever-pitch. He’d made some serious noise dropping 16’s on some massive records the year before, namely Ma$e’s Debut album, Harlem World, LOX’s debut, Money Power Respect. Not to mention, his verse on LL Cool J’s \"1,2,3,4\" — the song that started the beef between Canibus and LL [more on that another time]. So, when It’s Dark and Hell Is Hot hit the streets, hot on the heels of the single, Get At Me Dog, people lost their minds. What Jeezy had (regarding an aura of authenticity) when he first dropped, X had in overabundance. He was a hyper example of NYC’s gritty streets, circa the early 90s (think Onyx Bacdafucup) mixed with this inexplicable [because I'm a guy] appeal that had females open. The record was a product of the good old days of Def Jam, when über meticulous attention was paid to creating full bodies of work. The album was personal, aggressive, insightful, and catchy. Records like Ruff Ryder’s Anthem and Get At Me Dog become anthems in the big apple, and nationwide.\n\nRecords that have always stuck out to me were \"How’s It Goin’ Down\", a record that sees D essentially letting go of a relationship with a married/taken woman, and \"Damian,\" where D sells his soul to the devil in exchange for success — a storyline he picked up on subsequent albums.\n\nThe album sold over 200k in its first week, and two years later, was certified 4x platinum. A mere seven months later (within the same calendar year), he released his follow-up album, which also reached 4x platinum status. He became the first rap artist to have two number-one albums within one calendar year. It may be younger heads to grasp how large DMX was, but numbers don't lie. And those numbers are reductions. He helped usher in names like Eve, Swizz Beats, and a host of others; and, was an inspiration to countless artists. I'm not even going to get into Belly, and his other movie roles, or his other albums. But, DMX's place in (hip-hop) history is well deserved.\n\nHe still packs shows, though, and as of late, seems to be on a more positive path. It's been well publicized that his issues with drugs and alcohol have been a dark cloud over his career -- and more importantly his life -- for a better part of the last decade.\n\nListening to this album as I write, 18 years after first pumping it in my blue Sony Walkman during the summer of 1998, takes me right back to that time in my life. It's true that much of the love D still gets is due to the nostalgic value of his classic catalog; however, the album is timeless. It more than holds up -- and stacks up -- today, just as well as it did when it first dropped. I still get the same feeling as I listen \"How It's Goin' Down,\" reminiscing about an era that seems like yesterday, but is a lifetime ago.\n\nIf you've never indulged, give the album a spin. If you're a real head, re-indulge. All hail the Dark Man.\n\n[Dark Bark]... What the deal?",
